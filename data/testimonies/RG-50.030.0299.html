ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  When the Antisemitism started increasing, this was roughly when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  It was about 1935, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Tell me about your involvement with the youth movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Tell me when you first got involved in it and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I got involved in the youth movement, was approximately when approximately I was about 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It was an organization, a Zionist organization, and mostly in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , the youth belonged to different kind of Zionist organization, but it happened that the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir was one of the larger ones, and it was a very — a social outlet, and at the same time we learned a lot, at that time we learned a lot about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , in hoping that some way in some time I will all be able to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And this way was going on for quite a few years, from 1932, 1933, 1934, in the years to come, in the summers we used to go to different — for vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for about a month, or six week camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we used to have 50, 75 kids my age from different small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from different areas, and that's where we spent almost every summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">In the same way as my two other sisters belonged to. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They were not together in the same — they were a different age, so they belonged to different groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We had a reason partially for that because we thought we have no future. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We, already, by that time we were thinking that we had no future to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So, our dream was that some day that we were going to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , especially for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In the later years, in 1937, I applied to go to <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So, I applied to be accepted with Youth Aliyah!. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And by that time it was impossible, almost impossible to get a special visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The only way you could was a small <span class="DLF">window</span> of opportunity was it being a youngster with Youth Aliyah and going to <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So, some of my friends already went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, I had some friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and I was waiting the time will come, and I will get my visa, and I will move to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And then the war broke out, and I never was able to get the visa and emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  In the time before the war broke out, what did your parents think about everything that was going on; do you remember their talking about the Antisemitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I remember talking about it because we did not have any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> which were not Jewish, and all of a sudden, they — some way, they got organized and they opened up <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , supported, I don't know by whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was partially maybe by the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I don't know from whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was too young to understand probably, or to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And they opened up <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> with special competition to our <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , not only to <span class="BUILDING">clothing stores</span> , but in all different kinds of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">If it would be a <span class="BUILDING">food store</span> or anything else and to cut down the prices and even already some <span class="NPIP">places</span> ' A Zionist program which sought to evacuate Jewish children and young people from Europe and provide them care and education in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">they stood, or they hired special young people to stay by the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and most of our customers were farmers or coming in from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , and they used to stand in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> by telling them, “Don't go in, that's a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And don't let him go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They stood in front of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and didn't let customer or farmers walk in. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We couldn't do much hardly about it, because you couldn't go to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The police wouldn't help you or do you, because we hardly had, even with a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like this, I don't remember, maybe we had one. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We didn't even have a Jewish policeman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So, everything, I mean like the government, the city jobs were held by Gentiles, but not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And so life was getting little by little it was getting rougher. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And the question 1s “Why didn't they move out, why didn't they go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , why didn't they go to a different part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It wasn't so easy when your parents, or my parents, we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but maybe the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was 100 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My father lived there, my grandfather lived there, who knows who before, and we lived in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and for us it was settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Plus the family, all the family that we had, and we had quite a large family, we had I believe over 80 people, members in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They all lived in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> , not too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So life was almost a comfortable life. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It wasn't a rich life. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It wasn't luxury, but for us, we felt that we had all the luxury that we wanted, so life was almost, we could say, special like normal, until the last years when they started Antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, that too, we had in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We had the strong men. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Who were the strong men? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Slonim had all the — how would you call them, the “draggers’.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It means the people who would load from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> — from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , load the merchandise, put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , at that time it was more horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , to deliver to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was the strong guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> two strong guys, quite a few other ones, but two of them were the main two strong guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">In fact, I remember the name of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">One of them was Haskel and one of them was Note. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, by that time, arms was not available. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Nobody used arms, but he could find out if somebody, Polish kids, or Polish young men come and did something, hid or did some damage to some of the Jewish people, he could come up to him and break his arm or break his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And that was the punishment, and they were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, we had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">That was in our favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had this strong man were with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, usually it was like a good protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And that's the way it was going on almost until the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Tell me about the war breaking out and those first few weeks after. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Tell me what you remember of the moments and what you heard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  We had two accidents of war, as far as I'm remembering. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The first one was when the pact was made up between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ribbentrop</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Molotov</span> — when they decided they were going to split up <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and they split up our part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where I lived.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So, at that time when it happened, that transfer was the expectation was very — was almost, I mean, we didn't know it was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We didn't know what the deal was. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, we thought, we didn't know who was going to occupy our part of the land Slonim, until we realized that all of sudden the Russians are the ones to occupy our Slonim. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was a tremendous, * Literal translation from the Yiddish “schleppers,” a term used for manual laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">> On September 29, 1939, foreign ministers Joachim von Ribbentrop of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Vyacheslav Molotov of the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> modified the earlier German-Soviet Nonagression Pact with an agreement that partitioned the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">tremendous excitement, and we were very happy, because we didn't know what the Russians were going to do us, but we knew that between the two evils, we called them at that time, the Russians were much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Because the Germans, we knew, if they are going to come, they are going to be much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We did not know about any killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We did not know about anything they were going to do, but so, but we heard — 1n the 30s Hitler was already in power — what he did to some refugees that came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when they were thrown out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , and they told us what's happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And here, the Russians came, SO we were very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And me being a kid, I jumped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> moved in, and they were very friendly, so we jumped — kids — on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We were very, very happy, but only thing a little accident happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was wearing a nice watch, that I had got for my bar mitzvah, and here I am on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and the Russian officer comes in, and he says, “I like your watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">How much do you want?” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I remember I paid like something a small amount of money 10 dollars, 10 zlotys whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He gives me 20, 25 zlotys, so I figure, “Oh-ho! </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It's a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I'm going to give him the watch, and I'm going to go out to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy another one.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Sure enough, I couldn't get another watch anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, but this was indeed to every <span class="NPIP">place</span> they came in like hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I mean, they were hungry for merchandise, for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So, they were grabbing and running in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and taking away, buying out — they didn’t take away — buy out— but they give us piece of paper, rubles, but we didn't realize that we wouldn't be able to replace like in our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They come in and they bought out the whole <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The whole shelves in couple days, one day almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But my little experience with the watch, and then I found out it had happened with everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They were buying out, but mainly we were terrible happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The material things didn't bother us, because the question was of life and death and what war was going to bring in. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So this material things was just past and didn't mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We were very happy by being occupied that time by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Then, I had another experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Years — I'm coming back to the same — belonging to the Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So our togetherness, or our organization, still didn't disband, but we went secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, we were part in this Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And here I got an order, two of us, for me and another friend of mine, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , which is approximately, I don’t know, maybe 200 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So, we went for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and they said in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> we have the Zionist organization 1s active and we should take a ride over there and see what kind of connections we can make and maybe I can find the connections to move to — go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So, I left my family and I went with my friend and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And it turns out, I find out later, that being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , staying over there, they gave us, we were all in a couple large <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , a couple long <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span> , and we didn't know yet, if you could go to — some way to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> was — that time was Litwa*. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litwa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And the Russians didn't fully occupy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, there was a lot of freedom there. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">What we didn't have here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And being over there I met some other young people that belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That's the only way the secret could go on was is knowing with the same organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That's illegal, so you were afraid to be — I mean to reveal to other people to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So, I was there and I got in touch with the leadership from the Ha- Shomer ha-Za’ir, and to my disappointment, they send me back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They said, “We need leaders in the organization not to leave now, but we need them still in the <span class="REGION">occupied territory</span> , * <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> (Polish) back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So, fortunately for me, at that time, I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was arrested by the way by the Russians on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and they took me as a spy, but I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , I was back with my family until the real war broke out between — under the Russian occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I wanted to follow my education, so I went to a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Russian technical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And, what I learned there is to be mainly partly of engineering in movie projectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The whole movie contents of the system, how the projector works, how the film works. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">By that time it was a novelty. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The course took us almost a year, and then after a year to pay him off, everything was free in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, they sent me away in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to show movies on <span class="DLF">farms</span> in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That's the same thing, it was maybe 70, 80 kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">In there I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I used to go out and show movies in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Collect a few <span class="DLF">farms</span> or small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and show the movies in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , show Russian movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And that was Russian propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And being over there, one night on a Saturday night, I was out on a date, late in the evening, I could hear the bombardments and the war started, the Russian-German war. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And here it caught me away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , nobody around, a young fellow, and I had to make up a decision, should — it was immediately panic with the Russians coming in — should I run with the Russians, away from the front, because the front wasn't that far away, or should I go back to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I decided I’m was going, going on — to go on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then I'll go away, run away in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="133">Technical conversation] Going on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , already I could feel the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">What did I see on the <span class="DLF">road</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What did I see on the way? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The Germans were shooting other people and the refugees running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was soldiers, it was plain people. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was people like me, and we were trying to stay a little bit off the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and here the Germans used to came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and dive down and shoot at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">02: 37:10 Shoot people, innocent people running and just shooting at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The same thing like it would be animals or cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They were shooting on cows and people in the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Until the middle of the day, so all of sudden I saw a dog fight and I was real— because we didn't see any more Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The Russians were running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They left their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They didn't have enough gas probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They blocked up the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was a real panic on the <span class="DLF">road</span> going on, and we thought the Russians lost the war already. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I mean what we could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I'm sure they were just running from the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And we met pilots who didn't have a chance to even to get in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The Germans bombed the <span class="DLF">airports</span> , the <span class="DLF">air</span> runs. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And they were all running back to Russian — closer to the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> , deeper in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And here I see a dog fight, and I was very happy because it gave me some encouragement that maybe the Russians are still alive, but there were plenty alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Observing, so we lied down observing the dog fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They knocked down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German plane</span> and the German parachuted right in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, I took part right with the Germans, being part of the groups that were running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So some of the Russians, they had the arms, so they went right to the pilot where he parachuted in and they didn't wait too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">They killed him right on <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but they didn't take away his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">After they left, I was there and I took away his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So, that's the first time I already had a gun by myself, and I thought, “Maybe, I don't know I will have to use it or not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And that's the way it was burning, the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around were all on fire, all burning, and that took me about one night, and at — probably we got a little bit of transportation on the way, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the next day, I came to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , and that was on a Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I'd say it took us quite a few days between leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we almost — for a while I thought it’s only a few days —that’s quite a few days before we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Friday morning, I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I don't have to tell you, I mean the joy was real great that here their only son — they had three girls, I was the only one son. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">In Europe being one boy between four, between three sisters, so 1t was a big — a son was different than the woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I would be the one to Kaddish°, I would be the one to carry the torch, to be the head of the family was the Kaddish after my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, I finally arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and sitting over there and Friday evening before they make Shabbat, the shutters were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I can remember just like it’s yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And we are sitting <span class="BUILDING">home</span> reminiscing the stories, telling them again how much I went through the <span class="DLF">road</span> coming into my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , and it was later around nine, 10 o’clock we were ready to go to Sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It didn't take too long before I had the chance to fall asleep, we hear like crackles on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The first thing we hear is shooting, shooting in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I lived in a small <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and there's shooting going on, and one after the other is getting stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The shots are getting more often, and here I hear crackles on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So, I was thinking, “Thank God it's raining.” </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But it wasn't raining, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was a wooden <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> caught on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So, we were forced to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Now that's about one or two o'clock in the midnight, and the only thing you could see was from the moonlight, you could see everything what’s happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, some way we ducked out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we are in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and here 1n the middle of the fight 1s going in between the Germans and the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">What happened is, a group of Russians — they were left over, the front was already far, far away but they didn't know — the Russians didn't know that there was no more front in here and someway a fight was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So, we are coming out in the middle of the night, and we are immediately arrested by the Germans, and they put us in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , maybe approximately about 15 or 18 men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The women they pushed aside while the men they took and they made everybody, if anybody had a cap on, they made everybody to take off their caps. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And anybody who did not have hair, they put them in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They shoot them in our <span class="DLF">back yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So here I'm a young fellow, I lost my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and now I am witnessing a terrible massacre of eight or 10 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My luck they didn't take me because I had hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I wasn't in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The reason why they looked at our hair is that they thought that maybe it's Russians, changed their clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So, they took the people — and my father didn't have much hair, but he probably looked older, so by chance they didn't take him either. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But I know the reason why they didn't take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So, they killed them, and we had to dig a big <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> , a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and we buried the people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Eight or 10 Jews, 12 Jews, they killed them and here left over a young man with no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — coming back, no food, no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and by luck by the same thing, we had another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">> Holy One (Aramaic); Jewish prayer said to honor the dead, especially close family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">What my parents bought a <span class="BUILDING">duplex</span> that someday when my two sisters will have to get married, they’ll have a dowry for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And that was the custom in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and it was the custom in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is when a woman gets married she'll need a dowry. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, they bought the <span class="BUILDING">duplex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So, we went from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we went to the <span class="BUILDING">duplex</span> , we rented it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And some day they will give it to my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So, we went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we lived, at that time 1t was quite a few families lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because the Russians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> — originally, we had something like about 10,000 Jews before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But when the Russians occupied, lots of refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were not allowed to live in different parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so they pushed them to our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">In Slonim population grew from 8,000 to maybe 18 to 20,000, and that was Jews from the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So, it means the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> already housed many more people in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So, they made — they gave us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and after a while this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was split up too. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So, they give us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The family — there was not enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , to sleep in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and a new life was started out for us to live under the German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  How long before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was set up? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Tell me how that whole thing worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Allright. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now, this when we lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , Jews still lived in different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And it didn't take too long approximately, that was in June, end of June, about two weeks later they started. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">An order came out that all the Jews have to move in, in one <span class="REGION">area</span> , in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> we had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> so it— there wasn't enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the 20,000 Jews to move them in one <span class="NPIP">section</span> , so they made four sections, four small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">One larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and three other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , and that was maybe about I would say, between two weeks or a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  This was in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  This was in 1941, June of 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Were Jews—’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Yes, Jews — then Jews — when they put them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they ordered us to put on the patch, the yellow patch. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">In our <span class="NPIP">places</span> it was patches, instead mogen David*®— the yellow patch in the front of the garment and in back of the garment. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">You were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , on the <span class="DLF">street</span> only. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was put up with barbed wire, and the main thing is the order that they put out signs and orders that any Jew that will be caught outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without — I mean outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There was no other punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The punishment was, if you do not fill the order or get the command, your punishment was by death. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And lots of time the question comes up is, “Why did you go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Why didn't you stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was immediately impossible to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , because if you were caught, it's death. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And by that time, we had no idea that punishment is death. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Who ° Shield of David (Hebrew); tetragram. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">kills anybody, for what? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And so, everybody went — it was no big problem to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because nobody knew what is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So, it was no big, not a big threat not to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Plus, I mean, the population was very unfriendly and by some way the Germans would not recognize, especially for me, I had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I look Jewish, Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">For me, I would be recognized because the poles, most of them blonde and the way — with my look, it would be almost impossible to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and not be recognized that I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, I went with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We went — were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> together and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where they made, where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was, is where I lived, so I didn't have to move from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But next to us was three other small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and that's the way our bad life started out. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But the question to going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was no question for me or my family or for anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Like I said, the main reason is nobody knew what it was going to be <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> or anything else what could happen, the killing in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">It was unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But it didn't take too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">On July 17, I had another experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">The Germans walked in, in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> and they took out only male, young males. [</span><span class="sentence" id="245">Technical conversation] And then it came on July 17, 1941, a special commander group came in, 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we didn't know they were and they walked from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they took out young male only. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">How did they do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They organized like a chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They told each one to come out from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and stand on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And from the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they had guards organized almost every half <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They made you run to a certain <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">It was easy for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They didn't have to arrest him and take him from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Once you were out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you came right to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the appointed <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They made you run. “</span><span class="sentence" id="255">Raus, raus, raus!’“ </span><span class="sentence" id="256">and hitting you, and they didn't shoot us at that time, but hitting us and pushing us until we came to the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The destination was on the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Near the big <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> and it was near the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theater</span> , bordering with the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So, they made their — they crowded us all in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we were approximately 1,500 young people, and here I am caught in the middle of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And staying there, it was a real hot day. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">What were they telling us? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They were taking us out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We have some special arranged some work for us to do, some slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were coming up to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , loading them up, 30, 40 people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and taking them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I was there with my father, and being young, and being a little restless, so I say to my father — he says, “I'm very terrible thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I see its a spigot with water, right there in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I'm going to go right there in the back to get a drink of water.” </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So, I was kind of hard to push through to go to the back and get to the spigot of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But that time the <span class="DLF">line</span> came closer and in a few minutes I was trying to run back to be back with my father, and my father was loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and I couldn't already get in on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And my father was taken away and by that time I was left over behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And exactly — the punctuality of the Germans exactly at three o’clock the high German officer came in and he said the people the ones that are left could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So, I was left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There were left over 300 out of the 1,500, and I was left over with the 300. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Get out! (</span><span class="sentence" id="275">German) They made an <span class="DLF">exit</span> where we could run out, and they beat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They were standing with the rifles, they hit everybody on the head and the foot and any <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they just go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I wasn't hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I jumped over the rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He wanted to hit me in the legs, I jumped it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I came and I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that is the first time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and here I am the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I am the young man with three sisters and a mother, and my father was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Where did they take him? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They took him only about three or four kilometers away, and they killed them in <span class="DLF">pits</span> , in fact a very shallow <span class="DLF">pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">How do we know? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The Germans even tried, they made some of the people to write notes to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that they are fine, they are alive, and they are working. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And then they killed them right in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But, some of the mothers, women, mothers, sisters, they didn't believe so they went down in a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">At that time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wasn't so hard to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It was right from the beginning July 17, 1t was only a few short while after we were occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, they went out and they found the pla— the farmers were telling them where it happened and the name was Szpakowo. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they found the clothes from their loved ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And then it was known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that they killed them all just only a few miles away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">That was the first time we found out actually that people were being killed in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So, the whole, for me it was — it changed my whole way of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It changed my whole — I accepted immediately and I started thinking that, “I don't think we will be able to survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So, we started working underground with the same people, with our friends and for us thinking to find a <span class="DLF">road</span> maybe some day we'll be able to go out through the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So, immediately already the roots was developing. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was forming for the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And my history 1s a lot of survival through the underground.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Yes, younger men, too — when we read the history of the Holocaust, what's happening in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , it's almost happening the same way in every other — the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It's to take out the strong men. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The able men. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Break up the family, and that was done in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">When I talked to some people that survived in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , and it almost happened like a copy of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , happened in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They called the it chapones®. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">There's a name even for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They came in, they grabbed — a one day Aktion’ and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And tomorrow they went in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So, it was like a plan that was all planned out, how they're going to follow, how they're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But, we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We were little, little people between a big machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We had no idea how they worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They had their psychiatry, they had their monies, they had their government, they had their plans, and we were just small little people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and not knowing anything what’s planned for us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  You knew that from the outset. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You knew that there would be a reprisal because they said there would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Yes, by that time this in a little bit longer, they brought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , they brought in two or three farmers and they were hanging in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> with saying that, “This will happen to anybody who goes to the partisans or goes to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> or goes to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now, that way you could see by the clothes that they were wearing, it was innocent farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">You could see they weren't even partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But the main thing is the message that they were passing is, “That's what will happen if anyone is caught going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And in ® snatchers (Yiddish) ” action (German); term used for operations whose objective was the physical removal and destruction of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">return is they did many times, is by catching one they will take out a— punish other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Now, the next thing that happens — how does a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> operate? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">How does a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> work? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">How do you live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You're not working, you're not earning any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">How does that work. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Well, we were pushed into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and here were 20,000 people, Jews, in one small little <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We have no food, and we cannot earn any money to buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So, it was formed a Judenrat!®. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Who is the Judenrat? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the Judenrat, they took a committee, what they were before elders in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Their job before the war was like federation, we have it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They used to collect money to help the poor in different kinds of special and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish city</span> in the Jewish town, there's even lawsuits were going on, were settled not in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> but settled between the committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So, they were the first ones when the German occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They asked to form a Jewish Judenrat, and that's the committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So it was the easiest thing to take these people to take over the management of the government of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So, the first time we had approximately six or eight people that belonged to the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Now, what was their function? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Their function was — the first thing is to register the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">How many Jews are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It had a double purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Number one, the Germans wanted to know how many Jews we have there. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And the next thing is they used to give rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So, they gave us— you went to register, because if you wouldn't go to register, you had no way how to get a ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So, this was a double purpose for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">They knew exactly how many Jews are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because everybody wants to get food, and the rations were very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Something like 200, 250 gram of bread and maybe something else once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And that was the purpose of the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And then at the same time, is the Judenrat formed for Arbeitsamt!'. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Arbeitsamt means — 1s when the Germans came in and by that time it was even the Wehrmacht!’, </span><span class="sentence" id="393">the occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We had two different kinds of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">One was the Nazis and one was the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So, the army was just passing by, but in this same time already they learned how to rob, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It didn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So, they got orders to the Judenrat for slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">How do you get the best way slave labor, is you go into the Judenrat and you ask for 500 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">How do you get the 500 men? </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So the Judenrat formed a police, the Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The Jewish police got the order to go and get the slave laborers, so that was one part what was what the Jewish police did. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And the other, the next day the Germans came in and they asked for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> to fix their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The Jewish police went with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and pulled out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">The next minute they came in and they want 10 kilo of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They want 10 kilo of gold— how do you get 10 kilo of gold? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It's not what a Jew had gold in their pocket and in the <span class="DLF">vault</span> , and he gives them the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He had to collect the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">How do you collect the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You get the golden watches that they had from hundreds or thousands of years whom one passed to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They had rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They had bracelets, even golden teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">In Europe, they had a lot of golden teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The dentist used to pull out some teeth or some people died and they hold — holding teeth from them — or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">All and all they accumulate, they had to accumulate 10 kilo of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">That's a lot of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The next week somebody else came and they asked for another amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I don't know if it was 10 or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The next time they come in they want to have another '© Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to oversee <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . '</span><span class="sentence" id="420">l <span class="BUILDING">employment office</span> (German) '2 Armed forces (German) amount of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So, they collect 1t again. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">By that time 1t was much harder to collect, so the police had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and beg and ask and plead with the richer ones to save our lives — and we thought so too. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But maybe the passing time you'll buy off yourself with the order of the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And the third time, was no more people, was no more gold to give them so they took them out and killed the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And what did they say? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That the Judenrat collected the gold and they kept it for themselves, and that's the reason they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">That was no reason for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They killed them because it wasn't any more gold to give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So, life — that too, put a panic in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">They have to select another Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was harder to get another Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So Slonim had a history, they had three Judenrats, and they were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">By the end they had only a Judenrat of only one man. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">That was by the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So, life was getting, every day, tighter and tighter, and coming back to the Aktion of the 1,500 men, till was quiet in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We called it quiet in comparison to the other times. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So we called it normal, quiet, tranquil. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It was going on every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">By that time, I went out on slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I got a job working in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> they called it the Beutelager’’. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">It was the place where they collected arms, the Russian arms and put them in one or two <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So, I found a job at this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I had inclination that I was a mechanic and being a mechanic, they let me work in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Over there, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> , I worked for a few months, and the head — a foreman of our group who was named Choraszansky the, the father of one of my friends, the one nucleus that was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So, we tried to smuggle in arms to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">How do you smuggle in arms to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Every time you came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you were searched, and if you are caught with a piece of bread — not only a piece of arm — you were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, we found a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The foreman, the one I worked with, was very, very friendly with the two Germans around the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And it was two German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Now, they were not Nazis, they were part of the Wehrmacht and one's name was Mutz and one was Brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So, he got very friendly with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">What was the friendship? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He could bring out — the foreman — was bringing out different kinds of clothes and valuables whatever they wanted from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they exchanged with him for articles like soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And they had a lot of soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I don't know for what reason, but they had lots in their <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , they had a lot of soap too. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Because they had this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , other <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> with food, too, some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So, bartering with them, he made a deal with them that whatever he pays him sometime, he'll help him to bring <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because what good 1s it if he gets it outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">How does he bring it inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So, what he did is, he gave him a boxes of soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It's a wooden boxes and soap was large pieces like this not like we have it here, and we got an idea is to take out the soap under it and put hand grenades and put part of guns underneath and Mutz and Brown would take it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with us, and delivering us the ammunition for us inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And we did it quite a few times until we had well in comparison to any fighting force it was not enough arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But meanwhile, we brought in, we start bringing in arms, and we had already, cache of arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">'S <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> of confiscated goods and valuables (German) So, this way, our organization got bigger, then we got in a radio which we took out from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , a broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and we put it together and we got a radio inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was cut off from any type of news. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We had no news, we had no radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I didn't mention before that going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you couldn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They took away everything from you if you had something, no radios, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , no telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">No nothing, anything like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">At the same time we had no information. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">No newspapers and no radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Television wasn’t yet in any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So, we got — start getting news, our own news. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We could listen to BBC so we passed the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The main thing it was the news for us is how successful are the Germans with the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That was our main news. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We didn't need— [Technical conversation] End of Tape 1 Tape 2 [Technical conversation]
QUESTION:  Why don't you tell me about how that Aktion was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  It was tranquil, and then it came -- the big Aktion November 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Maybe, that's the way Pll start. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was tranquil. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It was almost quiet, but not that quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Once in a while the head of the Gestapo used to come in and punish somebody by finding for different reasons and maybe he didn't take off his hat against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And from them he could take out his gun and just kill him for it because he didn't give respect to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">That means, the head of the Gestapo coming in the inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We called it, it was pretty quiet and tranquil because no Aktion was coming on since the taking out the 1,500 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Until we came to a big massacre and we called it Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So the German words called it Aktion, and from there on we called it also too an Aktion is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And then here on November 13, I lived right next door to us with a photographer — lived there photographer and some Germans used to come in and take pictures, photographs in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to be able to send back to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So, they took pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And this particular German came in that day and he says, “Something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I don't know, but lots of special groups, and whatever the name he called them, Nazis or Kommandos"* or — came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and looks like something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I would suggest, if you have a way, hide or get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And other signs was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that they gave special scheins!°. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The scheins is a special little piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The tradesmen, important tradesmen, where they worked for the Germans and they called them the special Niitzliche Juden’®. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And in fact some of them they even moved to a different part the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So, we knew it was kind of happening, a distinction between our working Jews and non. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So something we started worrying about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">This is the same time when the German came in and he told my neighbor that something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So, I decided that I am going to go and hide someplace outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Now, it wasn't hard to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It wasn't hard to move out, some empty <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So we went out during the night and we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It means me and my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">My family is now my mother and three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We were hiding in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the next day on November 14, 1941, that Aktion started. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">At eight o’clock they — a group, a big force of Nazis came in inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they pulled out 10,000 men, women and children, in the same thing the talk was, they were going to take them out to slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">People had no idea, because at that time, if you would hide in any parts of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> — some people were hiding under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> — they could survive this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, you know the people were so unprepared, so not having any kind of idea that they are going to take out 10,000 people to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They were almost ready to be taken, to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It was no resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And I can understand why the ‘4 commandos (German) 'S Certificate (German); term used for Nazi issued work permits. '</span><span class="sentence" id="514">© Useful Jews (German) resistance wasn't there, because it was unprecedented to know that they were going to take out people to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So, people went and from eight o’clock the same thing until four o’clock or three o’clock, they killed 10,000 people, in not too far away, I forgot the name of the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chepelevo</span> , they took out 10,000 people, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">They killed them right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">In fact, the night before they took 100 people, the same thing on slave labor, to dig the <span class="DLF">pits</span> , and these people never returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They killed them right in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they never returned back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So, nobody had any idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It was pretty secretive, pretty known, you know, and this way they killed this tremendous amount almost half of our population. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So, we started working, we got much more involved—
QUESTION:  Wait, before we leave this — you— your mother and sisters were all hiding outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , did you hear, you couldn't hear anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  How long did you stay out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Only one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We stayed only one night, and after the Aktion was over, the next day we returned back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and by that time we lost everything, a lot of my friends, a lot of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Then a few days later, 1t was known they were taking out, not too far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Because some of them survived the massacre in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> , so they came, wounded, they came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So, the Germans, after they found out that some people survived, they came in with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and took all the people from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So, it was already known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when they took out the 10,000 people and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So, I returned back a day later and by that time we didn't have the experience to know yet, but we figured the Aktion is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">There's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we couldn't hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We couldn't stay much too longer, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> anyway, because the Poles would give us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So, we returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We felt safer to go back <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> than staying <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And we returned, the next day we returned back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and here we found half of our friends, family were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I got much more interested in our bringing the underground organization, but at the same time I’m unfortunate, I already lost already some of our friends, some of my friends were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But we were still left over, a nice group. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, we started meeting more often, and planning and see how we can bring in arms to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So, I found a job in, I found a job in slave labor outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where they collected arms, Russian arms, which were left over when they were running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So, the Germans were collecting it in three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and they called it a Beutelager. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">For me being, knowing a little bit mechanical work, so I got the job to be able to work in this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And some of my friends, the ones from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and the foreman was the father of my friend Choraszansky. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">He was in charge of that section, and he working for there quite a while, he established a good relationship with the two Germans, the ones who were in charge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They were German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">One was his name was Brown, and Mutz, Mutz and Brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And what was the bartering, what was the business that we could handle, we could do with them is, he used to take out some clothing or some valuables, it could be watches or something else, and in return he used to get from Mutz or Brown, he used to trade him for soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Now, this soap used to come in wooden boxes, small wooden boxes stacked up with soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So, what we did is we took out the layers, right on the bottom layers, we put in some hand grenades, all different parts of arms, on top we put back the soap, nailed back the box. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Now, how do you take them inside the box of soap? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So what we, what Mutz, mainly Mutz was doing it, so Mutz with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> used to deliver back to slaves, us the Jews, back to slaves to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">In fact with this he used to drive inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because everybody knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He was there every single day picking up the laborers back and forth, and they knew him, so it was nothing a German coming in with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They didn't check his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They didn't look in anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So, this way we could come in together with him and they didn't check us. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And this way we had a good chance to bring in — actually, what the Germans did the job for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They brought in the arms for us there inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And it didn't take too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We had a few rifles, we had handguns, because a rifle takes a little more, it was a cut off rifle, we put it in the sack of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We did it not only with soap, but we had flour when they brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And we even had a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The radio, what kind of radio is we took out from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , a broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We took out the radio and put it someway together and we could get news. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Now, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had no communication with the outside world, or even with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We had no newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We had no radios, and before you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they took away from you everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You were not allowed to have no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">No telephones, no radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So, actually we are ina vacuum. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We didn't know anything of what's happening any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the world, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> even our neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">If Aktions of killings were happening in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">It was just like a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We had no idea what's happening from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Not talking from farther away like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but even in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> next to us, we had no idea what's happening unless, unless once in a while somebody ran away from the massacre and they came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they tell, 1s the only news you could find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And that's the way our organization was developing, but we had less members. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">How many members we had, we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Our immediate membership was, well we usually probably had 10 or 12 and then we lost a few, so we had about nine, 10 members put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And right after the massacre, life turned back to normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We call it normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Now, we have a different way of what normal life means, but being the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we call that for us, it's quiet and I lost that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They didn't let any more people, and I remember the night him and I worked in the Beutelager. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I remember the night of Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">It happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We heard it by the Germans that the war started in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and so the hopes kind of helped us that maybe some help would come from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And at the same time we were talking between each other, maybe the world will find out, help will come, but it never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">How could <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , how could they let to take people, take people and just kill them out, or destroy a people, but help never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So, the underground was going on, but I had to still make a living to support — I am now the head provide of my <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So, I found another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">My job was in Verpflegungsamt!’. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It means a big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where they're giving out food to— we'd call it to older Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">It could be Wehrmacht it could be Nazis, it could be rations to anybody who was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So, one day they came and they picked 300 people from the <span class="DLF">street</span> to unload a big transport of food, because that's when they opened up at that time, this particular <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So, they picked up 300 men, because they needed it real fast unloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> was almost a block long right on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So unloading it, I could see its a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It's nice, it was food, it was only with food, all different kinds of food, even big like a tire of swiss cheese and wines and everything were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So, something was going on they were talking that they might pick some of the people to have a steady job. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, I tried to be young and strong and not hungry completely yet, so I worked like a slave that particular two days, and I was probably one of the best workers, and they picked me by the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I was one of eight people where they picked on this particular job. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And after the third day, I had a steady job. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">It was a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I could support my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I could bring food. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">They gave me food. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It was a well paid job. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I worked there in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> until I got an order to go out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It didn't take long, in a short while I got an order to go to come to a special <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">In this same time, I remember probably it's in this same time when it happened is — aone of the men when they took out the first time the 1,200 men and killed them, was a friend of mine, and he lived about a couple <span class="DLF">doors</span> away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, I went to visit his — no, no they took out his father, mistake not — he was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">His father was taken out on this particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So, I came to visit my friend, and next <span class="DLF">door</span> I saw a nice beautiful girl, so I asked him, “Who is the girl?” </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And he said, “She lives right here next <span class="DLF">door</span> to me, if you want it I'll introduce you to her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="618">That was the same girl, the one I still know up until now. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It was Lisa Nussbaum that was her name, and I got acquainted with her and saw her and start coming in every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The only thing I had a little bit problem because she was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">She was not quite 15, and her father didn't like it so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">By that time, Lisa was — her mother was killed in that big Aktion, so her father didn't like it that I was such an often visitor coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but I had a very good job, and I had food with me, and I had cigarettes with me and I had dry food what I used to bring from the Verpflegungsamt. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It gave me a chance to bribe him off, with the food, with the cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And so, every time I used to come in, I used to bring in my pockets some dry foods, a package of cigarettes, before, it didn't take too long, I was a nice, friendly visitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">This way I was coming in more often, and I got to know Lisa, and she was a very beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">She had longer hair with — curly hair with a longer face and I almost fell love in with her, but not quite yet because right from the beginning here I am getting an order that I have to go to the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">That was my dream all '7 <span class="BUILDING">Food distribution bureau</span> (German) the time to go to the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But it was just the beginning when I started knowing Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So, it wasn't such a big — I mean objection for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  How did the order come to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  The order came to me in very simple words. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Somebody came and told me “Aron, tomorrow at six-thirty, seven o’clock you come to this particular <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but almost by the end next to the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So it came the order that, “tomorrow six-thirty, seven o’clock you're supposed to be there.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="636">No questions asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I took my little knapsack and I put it in something over there, I don't know next to a shirt, pants, if I had anything, and I go to my <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was supposed to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">My mother and my sisters notice that I'm going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I'm packing up and I’m going someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They weren't so excited with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Here I am the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">They need me so badly in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , bringing in food, helping them with the rations, and the only man in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I'm leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So, my mother followed me and she came to the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And being over there I am meeting some of my friends and some other new people that I didn't know, other people, and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens up and my mother comes in and she falls on her knees and she starts crying and she starts begging, “How could you do it and leave us by ourselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">You're going away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Now, that was not typical of the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Other families were just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">The mothers would take the kids and throw them out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , ““Go ahead, maybe you'll survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="651">My incident was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It took me a long, long time back until now, how much, if I did the right thing or not, and many times I could never forgive when I didn't take this opportunity to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> because some of my — anyway I turned back and I went back with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Until the other things happened, but I could never forgive myself, my mother, I don't know, I could never come to terms with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Did I do the right thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I didn't, for saving my life I didn't do the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The way my life turned out, it was all right, but that was one of my worst — anytime when I talk about that, it's a very, very hard decision to come up and decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But being the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> — so being the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> worked very, very hard on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Maybe if she wouldn't have mentioned that word, maybe it would be different, but saying that the father was taken away and you're the only one, so I turned back and I went back. — </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Slonim. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I never had another opportunity, never had a chance to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Some of my friends, they did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They run away, they survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Some of them were killed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , but here I had a chance, yet I went too much, much more after that, but here I had the chance to be in a fighting unit and go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I didn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">It took me many, many years to rationalize if I did the right thing or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I went back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">My relationship with Lisa — well in this way Lisa helped me a lot, because by that time I developed a relationship with a girlfriend and I lost some friends, but I gained, in that time, I gained with Lisa, and our relationship developed much closer and the visits were often, and that was going on until the terrible day of June 29, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">That's a new chapter where it starts there. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">About that time our organization was almost — we lost more people and some people went away and I was kind of like almost like reyected because not going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , so I was left over almost like not faithful or not being part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , and until the day of June 29, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It was only six months later from the first massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Here was lots of luck with me, lots, lots of what happened with me in this particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Being a worker, a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work for the Verpflegungsamt, I too had developed a relationship with the — well, I can't call them Nazis because this was the Verpflegungsamt, so I developed a good relationship with the two officers, the two captains of the — there were five Germans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">There was man by the name of Captain Miller, Captain Brauer, and then one was a Fritz, I don't remember exactly the three other plain soldiers, the ones that we were working with. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So, we were working, the eight of us <span class="NPIP">inside</span> filling the orders and the Germans were in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So, we took it over — 1t was— we took over the old <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and we did our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We did a good work because we wanted to save our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">It wasn't so much the dedication of being dedicated to do their slave labor, but that was our only source of our good source of bringing in healthy families and having enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Until that particular day, a special Einsatzgruppen group came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with many, many Nazis with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in the day before in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and mainly they all need their rations, their food. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So, where do they come? </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They came into that Captain Miller, and that was on a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So, they came into him to get some rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Meanwhile, from the time from the first massacre to the second massacre, everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> realizing what happened the first time, if you could hide under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , if you could hide in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , maybe they didn't find you. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So, what happened was each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> tried to make malines!*. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The name of maline they called it, it's a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Now, a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> could take any different kind of ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It could be a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> — if you had a <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> — with a covered <span class="DLF">entrance</span> where they couldn't find. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">In my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we had 32 people living. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And we made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for the 32 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Where was the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> — was a wooden floor — we pulled out some dirt and luckily we had a small <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and put it out in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and we made in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> a special <span class="DLF">entrance</span> which was hard to recognize. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">That would be the place to hide in case another Aktion would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We knew it was going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Now, every other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had their different ways how to make where to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So, I was when the news came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the day before, that something was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">How did the news come in? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">The traffic <span class="NPIP">outside</span> you could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">All of a sudden some new faces, some new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> because we were on the watch-out. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Everything we were looking for any signs and all of a sudden you could see the atmosphere was different <span class="NPIP">outside</span> than everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> are passing by, and by the way, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was divided, the main <span class="DLF">thoroughfare</span> , all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> had to pass by. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Was one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> you can walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but you could see if they could go around in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but some Aktion was coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So, we were getting ready to — if something happens during the night or the next day — we were getting ready to hide in this particular <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So, here, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miller</span> with the order for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And especially they wanted the '8 hideout (Yiddish) whiskey. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They always did it with the whiskey to get them drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They could do the job without being drunk, but it helped when you gave them the schnapps, the whiskey. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So, they came in for the order, and Miller said, “I cannot do it unless you give me my eight Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So, now we are his eight Jews, because they work over there in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The head of the commander had to get a special permit to be able to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I mean to get out that Miller should be able to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and take out the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I don't know they were negotiating that what they told us later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They were negotiating almost all part of the evening and the next day, on Monday morning about six-thirty, Miller and the other four Germans were living right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It was a nice rich — before the war, it was a nice <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> , so they took it over when they threw the Jews inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So, Miller comes in to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he gives the order, shows the order to the guard and to the Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">The Jewish police were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to get Dereczynski — that's me — and the other people, get them together as fast as they can -- 10 minutes, 15 minutes -- to come everybody by the <span class="DLF">exit</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was small, it wasn't that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I get a call in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when the Jewish policeman knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We were already ready to hide, and he runs and he knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> when he calls, “Miller is waiting for you outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ,” otherwise I would never go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He knocks a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">He said, “Dereczynski, Dereczynski, Miller wants you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And he mentioned Miller, otherwise I would never come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So, I went out and here he tells me that Miller was giving me the order to get the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So, we got the people together and we went in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very hard leaving everybody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Here I am going out, but this time, I didn't have no hesitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was very hard to part that you are going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I don't know if you'll ever get back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But I did go out, and five minutes to seven we were there and Miller takes us out and walking out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , not going even maybe one <span class="DLF">block</span> we could see that the destruction of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 1s coming, because we saw like a <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Germans with machine guns all surrounded the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we are passing, all pointed to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Like you see a regular <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Now, what is that for? </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Then we walked out another short while, a few minutes later, we hear a shot and the Aktion started exactly at seven o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">By that time, the Judenrat was a man of one. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">His name was Kwint!’, </span><span class="sentence" id="732">and the minute they started coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he asked them, “Where are you taking my Jews?” </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So, he was killed right there by the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Kwint was killed right there by the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I found it out later, I didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But I could hear the shooting and then small little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> immediately you could see because we saw little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> filled with all different kinds of auxiliary forces was standing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and you could see they're getting ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">In fact, one comes out on the way when we were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">One high German officer comes out from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and he stops us and he says “Where are you taking the Jews?” </span><span class="sentence" id="739">In fact he if I’m not remember, he may have even called him “Miller.” </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He said “Where are you taking the Jews?” </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He said, "If you're not giving me the Jews, you won't have any food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And, “Heil Hitler” and he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And they took us to the Verpflegungsamt, which was approximately one mile away and we came back to the Verpflegungsamt and in the '? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Gershon Kwint, head of the Slonim Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Verpflegungsamt you could already see the fire, you could hear the shooting and the killing was going on, and before the evening came they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on fire, because they couldn't find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Most of the Jews were in the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , so they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So, you could see the flames of the fire and we are sitting inside the Verpflegungsamt. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Not be able to do anything, not be able to help and not sure with our own lives. “</span><span class="sentence" id="749">What are they going to do to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="750">When they get through with them, they're not going to let us witness, sure the next thing will be they'll probably kill us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So, we tried to figure out maybe a way that we'll be able to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">But, in that time, they gave us special scheins. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The schein was a small little card with a stamp from the Gebietskommissar”’ — it means the governor. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">There was only eight legally taken out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I was one of the eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And here we are sitting there and Miller comes out and everyday we used to go to the main <span class="DLF">street</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> to pick up bread for the rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">This particular time, Miller said, I wouldn't suggest anybody should go, you could be caught right on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So, I did with another two fellow workers we decided we were going to go anyway in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">We'll go to the <span class="BUILDING">Bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Now, passing by the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> is like I say, you pass by two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Another two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> a little inside that you couldn't see. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I wanted to see what was happening inside the <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I could see what's happening inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was already on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">People were running out from the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Some people were running out from the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Some people I saw where they were hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">We had <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> , outside <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> , so they were hiding <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="768">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was right there, maybe to wash off and they were killed right on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And other killings, you could see some dead people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was going slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We asked the driver, Fritz, when he passes by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to go slowly so we could witness this. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And it was happening like people were running and the old Jewish saying “fun fayer tzu vaser’”!, “</span><span class="sentence" id="772">from fire to water” Running from the fire to get drowned in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> or killed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and that's the view what I witnessed it, what I could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And I came back to the Verpflegungsamt, tremendous thinking of what are we going to do. “</span><span class="sentence" id="774">How are we going to survive or what can we do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="775">That was going on — but the same night he gave us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep in the Verpflegungsamt. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We didn't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That was going on for two or three days, and then Miller told us that they are going to let a certain amount of Jews live. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">They are not going to kill out the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And later on we found out they did the same thing all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They never killed out in the first or second time until the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Our experience showed later too, they did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Mainly the ones, the people that are hiding, is you let some other people live. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So, the people, the ones that are hiding would come out and then you make it from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of 10 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , you make the five <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , from five <span class="DLF">blocks</span> to 10 <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Then you keep them in the two <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Then when the Germans want to *° regional commissioner (German) 71 “from fire to water” (Yiddish) find you, they only have two <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to look for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They don't have the 10 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , what they had, or 20 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I found it out later that that was what was done in every type of <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So, they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">They left, the word was coming out they were going to let some Jews live. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It's not going to be completely liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So, what do I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I'm <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">My family is still <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Lisa is still <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I have no idea what happened with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I'm being there on the third day and I came to Miller, and I say, “I have a good idea for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And he, during the time with Miller, I bartered before too. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And he always used to ask me if I could get him certain different kinds of items to bring from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he'll pay me to send, probably send it back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Meanwhile, the night when this was happening, I noticed that Brauer, the other officer, he was kind of completely disturbed with the happenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">It was only one German what I ever met, what I could see that he was disturbed with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And I see him staying on the, on the — we had a lot of sacks and he is staying over there leaned on the sack with hands like this [interviewee gestures with both hands on head] and he said “I can't believe it that my people can kill and burn this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And he was talking to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And I just make it like I wasn't there around. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So, the next time, when a couple days later when Miller gave me the permit, I told him, I said, “You get me a permit to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The Aktion was still going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="806">Technical conversation} End of Tape 2 Tape 3
ANSWER:  After the second and third day, people were hiding inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they could not find anybody, and they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And then, a day later or two, they started announcing with the loud speakers that the Aktion 1s over and that anybody who comes out will get scheins, and they're not going to take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">By that time, some people were start already, coming out, so when they came out they immediately arrested them and they took them over in the <span class="DLF">jail yard</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">When I was working on my <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I found out that some people are going to be allowed to live, so I went to Miller when I offered him a proposition that if he would someway get me transportation to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I would go inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and find for him anything what he would like. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">For example, he wanted all the time, he wanted — at that time there wasn't too much valuables you could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I mean if people had small stuff they took with them whatever, but the bigger items, crystals, all different kinds of dishes, maybe some furs, this kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So he fell for the idea and he says, “All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I'm going to get you a special permission to get <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="814">In the afternoon, I asked him in the morning, a short while after, maybe an hour or two hours later, he came back with a piece of paper, with a permit to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he said “Fritz will take you to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He'll drop you off right inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and whatever you accumulate all different valuable stuff that you can find, you'll come to the front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ” — what's the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and the <span class="DLF">exit</span> , it's only one <span class="DLF">gate</span> — “you'll come right by the exit of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and you'll take it over to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He lived right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So, I was very happy to do it, and my intention was mainly was if I could go ahead <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and maybe I'll be able to find my family inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and Lisa, whatever I can do and help and see — “T'll decide what I can do later.” </span><span class="sentence" id="818">He dropped us off, four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He dropped the four of us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and it was still going on some of the Germans were still walking around inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to rob, to look for something to take it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to rob, to take away. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And but in the same time we are afraid that we shouldn't be arrested in taking like some of the survivors, so we all stayed together in one group with the document what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So, we came, we walked through part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Each one went to see if he could find anybody from their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I immediately went to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived and I knew exactly the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> or the hidden <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I knocked a few times until I got an answer and sure enough everybody was still there, and it was the people that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I found out it was 32 people were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and it was three, we found three dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The three dead people they committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">It was a druggist, and he was fortunate to have some poison, so his family took the poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And the stench it was! </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I couldn't walk in, inside but some way I went <span class="NPIP">underneath</span> and here the people were laying over there for three or four days under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with no lights and they couldn't even move. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">They couldn't stay on their feet, if they would come out in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">By some way I got <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and I had a chance to see my mother and my three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I couldn't help them with doing the taking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Whom would you take out? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">If I could take maybe one, I would have a terrible decision even to take one. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Whom to take? </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Whom to take? </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And but I gave them, I found some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I brought in some bread and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The food that I found is because there was some food in the empty <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where they took out the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I could still find some bread and what mainly was the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So, I gave them the water and the bread and I gave them, and I said, “We'll see what we can do the next chance I'll have.” </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I figured to myself “that's what I'll do.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I left them. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And from there walking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I met my other friends, the ones that worked with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Nobody had anybody of their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Their families were discovered and they didn't have found anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So on the way walking out, I had to pass by the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Lisa lives, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And here, I tell my people, and they were carrying the dishes, whatever we found we put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow cases</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">We didn't have any boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">We put them in pillowcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So, I was standing over there and they're waiting and I say, “Give me a chance, let me take a look if my friend is there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> next to them was a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">It looked like the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And, you could see a hand grenade blew up the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I still didn't give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I went to the back and I think, “Maybe they went in the back to hide.” </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So, I go in the back and I start calling out “Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And sure enough it, didn't take too long and an answer came out, and Lisa was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">She was hiding in a small little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , a wooden <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , very easy to discover, very easy to burn, but somebody was behind them upstairs and they kept the <span class="NPIP">place</span> intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It was not on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And she came down, and I made immediately my decision I made up, that I'm going to take her with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But how did I take her out? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Women were not allowed to leave yet, because the people, the ones they left was only men around them when they saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">It was no women. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So, what I did is I went right next door, in fact in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I met my friend, the one who introduced me to Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I went upstairs in their little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I found men's clothes, a pair of pants and a jacket and a cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I took her in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I cut her hair, and I put on a pair of pants and a jacket on top of her old clothes which she had, and the cap, and she cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I mean, her hair she never cut since she was born probably, but she was happy and excited, and at the same time she's leaving her brother and her father in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , but she took the chance that she went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Now, what I did was I gave her my schein, the passport to leave the little piece of paper and hoping in case if I'm caught Miller will some way take me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So, we're all getting ready to walk out, and we find a couple chandeliers, old broken things with wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I figure it's a good thing to keep it how to mask her up, she wouldn't be recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So I put on the one fellow, I put a chandelier with wires, we didn’t have much BX” with, with all different kinds of wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The same thing I did with Lisa, and here we're walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">There are five of us now with the bags and carrying the bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">We're coming out to the <span class="DLF">exit</span> and here the Germans are watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I take the piece of paper and say “Here's my four men.” </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And they took a look at us — they didn't even check — look on the paper, four or five, they didn't pay any attention, and they let us out and we walked right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , across the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the Germans live. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We're coming in over there and Miller in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it's the middle, or late in the 2 BX cable day, and Miller was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so I walk up to Miller, excited to join him with the bags of the goods that I brought him in, and I tell him I found my sister — can he help me to save my sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="883">He gets enraged and he hits his hands on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and says “This is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Get her out immediately.” </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I put her down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> over there and I let her in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and I figured maybe I'll be able to see if I can talk to Bauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">So, I wait for a while there, being over there and Miller took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">He went back to work and Bauer was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So, I walk up to Bauer and I say, “Captain Bauer,” I say, “I found my sister, can you help me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="890">He says, “Where is she?” </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I said, “She's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="892">He says, “Don't worry, I'll help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And he goes down with me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and Lisa sits in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">It was filled up with old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and she's laying like a little cat all rolled up scared to death and she was small. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">She wasn't a big girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And Bauer walks over and tells her, “Stand up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And she's scared and she stands up and he says, “You're not a boy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And he looks at her and so she just says, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And he says, “Do you have your girl's clothes?” </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And she says, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="901">He said, “Take off the boy's clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Take off everything that you have, and be back in your old clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">The only thing is don't have your the latte**, the Jewish sign, yellow star, the yellow square, round piece.” </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Anyway, and he told her “come up upstairs” and there were Jewish — one of our eight that worked like steady. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">He was cleaning the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the — for them and helping them <span class="NPIP">inside</span> like a slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And he came down and they brought her down a babushka with her hair in a babushka and he took her out from there and he told her he says, “I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We left with Fritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Fritz took us over with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> he took us back to the Verpflegungsamt and Lisa was left over there and Bauer took her to the Verpflegungsamt. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">He walked with her and he told her to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> — no more like on the <span class="DLF">street</span> — and “just walk like you're a Polish girl.” </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And in case — that was his words, “in case the Black Guard 1s going to stop you” — the Black Guard was the police from the Ukrainians or somebody with the forces when they come in — he said, “I'm going to kill him right on the way.” </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And he walked with her to the Verpflegungsamt. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I was over there already with my other helpers, but I was expecting her to come, so I made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Verpflegungsamt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I only had the problem; how do we bring her in? </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We smuggled her in someway, inside, the other Jews that are our friends helped me to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> here in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Verpflegungsamt</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Verpflegungsamt</span> was hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of sacks of all different of flours and sugar, all different kinds of foods, and it was packed in five or six, stacked like an army of soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So, I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to — I took out a few sacks, and I made a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and that was where she was hidden there for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And then later on I got a schein for Lisa, the same little passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I was transferred to a different Verpflegungsamt to the other <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to the Beutelager where I worked before. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We left that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could now live. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And Lisa was left over the night, for the night by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And the <span class="NPIP">place</span> with food with rats and everything right over there, and she stayed there during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I came a couple times during the day to visit her until she got the schein and then after I took her over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Two days later she went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I went *3 natch (Yiddish) back to help my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I paid off Miller. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He came in with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , Miller now, I came in with him, and we came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my family and the rest of them were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">By that time we found only approximately about 14 or 15 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">The young men, the young people, walked — went out from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I don't know if they survived or didn't survive, but they left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">We were in a covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with canvas, a canvas covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I took out my family and the rest of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">The rest of the people had money to pay him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They had valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They were pretty rich from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">When we're talking rich, we're talking maybe they had a couple coins. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But that kind of richness that we talk, we're not talking here for diamonds and big, big, big items, but 1t was enough because I promised Miller that, “They are going to pay you off. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">They are going to give it to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="937">So, I had to stand with my word, otherwise he could kill me too, if he would take him out and not get paid, he would take me out and shot, because that same Miller was a killer before. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">He took part in Aktions in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We found it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So, being good to me this particular time, helping me, it was me — it wasn't — the next Jew he would kill him cold in blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So, I was trying to make it sure they will have money to pay him. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So, I took them over to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Lisa was, but she couldn't be in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but next to it was another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and they were hiding over there, staying there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">The next day Miller gave them all scheins. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">By that time everybody could get a schein. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">They could go out in the open at that time and get a schein. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">By that time there was no more killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">As far as I think and I'm concerned there were no favors. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But that time was a time, like I said before, they decided they were going to let some of the Jews live. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So, it was done almost only to enrich his pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">He knew it was no big deal what he did, but he did it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And we stayed over there — by that time there was left over approximately 900, 1,000 Jews out of 20,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">In a short time, we had every night to get up in the middle of the night to be counted, but I made my way out from there to go to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I did the same thing and Lisa did the same way in two different times. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">We were separated for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I went with my mother and three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">In fact, Lisa, with her father and brother, left a couple days before. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Where did we go when I left a couple days later? </span><span class="sentence" id="959">A friend of mine knew a farm lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And the farm lady would take us 1n a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with the name of a Pruzhany name, Pruzhene”* and from there we were going to go to the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">We heard that in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the Third Reich — we didn't even know much about what the Third Reich meant — that in this Pruzhana”>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , this part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that there is no killing over there and that the Jews are still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So, we went with this farm lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">They found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">She took us in a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">She couldn't take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruzhana</span> she took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozhinoy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozhinoy</span> , they robbed us and took away everything, whatever we had, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozhinoy</span> , the woman is supposed to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruzhana</span> , so from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozhinoy</span> we got in touch with the Judenrat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rozhinoy</span> and they arranged for us to go from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> we supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So, we're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where some more refugees were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I asked the people in the Judenrat if you saw a girl with a young brother, with a young kid — her brother was 11 years ** Pruzhany °° Pruzhany old, 12 years old, 12 years old not quite 13, because 13, it was a year later, bar mitzvah — and the father, the father was an older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">At that time, older was 50, he wasn't 50, but in the 40s was an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And they told us, “Yes, a girl with them and they went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Here I am with my family, with my mother and the rest of family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> , and I have to make up my most important decision in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I had to make the — and it flashed through my thinking, a backflash, “Did I do right in not going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , going back to my family? </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And here I'm at the crossroads, should I go with my family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> or should I go single, young and single go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And I made my decision that I'm going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">It partly was my mind to break away from the family, because if the only chance I have is to survive is not to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">When you stay together you only perish together. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">There is no way that a family would be able to survive, so I made the decision that I'm going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And that's the last time I saw my family anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I left them, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> , was the place where we split up, the Judenrat helped me in transportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">How did I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="984">They put me with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beer truck</span> it was empty with empty kegs, barrels of beer that they were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> probably to, whatever, deliver or pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So, I was hidden between on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> until I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And that too, the Judenrat helped me to have gotten transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I came in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="988">By that time I think it was in August of 19— it was June, no probably in August of 1942, I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> was completely relaxed like hardly — it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but a very relaxed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">You could go in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">It was no killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">It was no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">For me, it was almost like coming in like a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I'm sure Aktions happened to the time but I wasn't aware, because I wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">So, I can't say that nothing happened there anything before, but the way it looked to me — coming in from the massacres and coming in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it’s quiet and people are moving around and in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you could see business going on, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , what was the business? </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Selling old clothes, selling a pair of pants, buying a pair of shoes, you couldn't even buy food on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So, for us, for me it was — I couldn't even believe that things could happen not only what was it, 70, 100 kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I thought to myself, “I wish everybody else would know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Maybe a lot of people would try from before.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Well, it was going on like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I found Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Lisa was there with her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">They lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and they took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I made my own friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And my main purpose was only one thing is, “How do I get in touch with the underground?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I'm single, I'm by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Single, I mean I'm not married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I'm not attached, and that was a tremendous plus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And how can I find a way with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The first thing I start looking to a Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, the Zionist organization, nothing helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Being over there I couldn't get in touch with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">After the war I found out it was an underground organization there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">But it was so secretive and being a stranger in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was impossible to get in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">So, here I am looking around, walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to talk to different kinds of friends and people had jobs and this, and I could in no, no way I could get in touch with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So, in being there, by November first there came in an order from the Gestapo to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto one</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto two</span> , they decided to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">That means from now on the Gestapo took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">If you had to go in or out, you had to have orders from the Gestapo, and it was getting on the same order that Slonim was from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">So, we are caught now with a population only one difference was, I'm an experienced person in people would have no idea what killing means or destruction means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I'm here, I felt myself, "I'm experienced — young and experienced, maybe I'll have a chance, find some other ways." </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">When they blocked up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> it was hard to go out for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">You had special permissions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">People went out to work and it didn't take too long they're asking for two transportation, resettlement started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And the name was — they are taking them out to work, and the <span class="NPIP">places</span> would be much better, because here already, hunger started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">A lot of people ran out of anything to sell or any valuables to be able to barter to change out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">You had to live only on the rations what you were getting, and that wasn't much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Rations weren't too great, too big, too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And they were the order to get 2,000 Jews for resettlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">So, they put out officially signs, I don't remember, with names or no names, but they said, "Take your best clothes, take your warm clothes, it might be cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Take your toothbrushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Take you food for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Take as much as you can carry in the suitcase or whatever it is." </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">They made us believe that they are taking you to a resettlement, but with my experience, I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So, here I thought, "We are going to be the first ones on the list, because we are the outsiders." </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And sure enough they came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">We were first on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I was first on the list, Lisa was the first, the whole family is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">But that's all I had to do was I was hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">When they came and looked for me, I wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So, they took other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">They filled the quota with some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">But I survived this first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And that way it was going on, day after day, quiet and then another Aktion, and then another Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And meanwhile, we start building malines, <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , the same thing as this and here I became an expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">People started knowing of me, what I went through, and now all of sudden they were getting interested, "How did you survive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Before, people didn't want to hear it. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1048">How did you survive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So I told them this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">So, they called me in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> how to build <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So, the one benefit that I got is I knew the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Helping them, I knew the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So, when it came up a big Aktion when they took only four or five days, I was hiding, they took out I don't know maybe 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> had 29,000 Jews at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">The vicinity around had another 10,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So, now I'm part of the 29,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So they took out one, one time, they took out in four or five days, another 10,000 and we were hiding in five different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">We were there, stayed there for 10 or 15 minutes, "I don't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Too many kids, it's not enough <span class="DLF">air</span> , its maybe it's...," someway I had the feeling they were going to discover it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And sure enough we went through five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I don't know how we survived, but we did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">How we survived the last time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">The last time we survived after we went out from different <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and it turns out they discovered, I don't know, not all of them, but most of them were discovered, but the last time is, we were hiding in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , a broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , what the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was checked and looked maybe a 100 times and that we figured that is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Because by now they are not going to look under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">The pillows and everything was all thrown out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We figured anybody walked in it only took a second to walk out, because they all realized that, "Hey, somebody was here already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Somebody before, they took out the people." </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And we survived under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">After that it was — I do not know exactly how many people were left over — but it was in December, I found a job to work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">In the meanwhile, being inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where I lived, I befriended with a very dear friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He became a dear friend after, and his name was Herschel Lipszyc. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And very nice person, very nice young man and he probably treated me like a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And I was so involved with him, and every <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he was going to work, he was asking me, "Why don't you join me to work?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And here, it came out in December, he tells me, “Aron you're very handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Why don't you be an electrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">We need an electrician.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I was a carpenter, an electrician, a shoemaker, anything what we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">When you're handy, it's not hard to become anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I mean, you're not an expert at that, but at least you know how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And he tells me that, "We need an electrician so maybe I can arrange that you can go out and they will hire you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">You can not just go with him and be an electrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">You have a foreman, the foreman has to accept you to take you out over there to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">So, he went to the foreman and he told him, “I have for you a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">He's an electrician, and he'll go out with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Let him come to work.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So, on that wintry day I went out to work with Herschel, and we were working with about five people, and what we are doing we were remodeling a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a Gestapo, a <span class="BUILDING">private home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So, we were remodeling the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so I was supposed to be an electrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Before when in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> knowing about electricity, so I knew a little bit how to work with electricity, and being over there we got acquainted with a Polish young fellow and his name was Tadeusz Soroka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">He used to come and the same thing, to barter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">He used to bring us food, and we in turn would bring him clothes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and change and this way we could bring in some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Herschel, my friend, knew him very much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">He knew him before the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So, he got real friendly with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">My friend Herschel Lipszyc didn't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">He was a little blondish looking, so Tadek, this Polish fellow tells him, "I have a connections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and over there I will be able to get you papers, Aryan papers so you'll be able to live as a non-Jew <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Herschel agreed to it with another friend of his Lutek, and they made their arrangements with Tadek — that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> is going to take them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">It's 180 kilometers, he's going to take him over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">They made up a certain time, and Hershel is supposed to send me a note if they come to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , if they came safe to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Because a lot times it was going on, somebody could take away from you — we didn't have any money, I didn't have much money— but to give out to the Nazis you would get a pound of sugar for it, or you would get some other food stuff for 1t, rewards for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">So, I wasn't sure. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Why would a Polish fellow just be so nice and do it for them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So we were kind of suspicious, I mean, whatever behind is or is it not, so we asked him for a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And Hershel left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I helped Hershel get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I cut the wires for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I was the last one to say goodbye to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And we kissed and hugged and, "We'll see you someday in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">A few days later, Tadek comes to me and he says, "I don't have a note." </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">He says, "It happened, he couldn't stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , he went inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">It started raining, and I couldn't stay long enough and I have no note." </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I worried about it and I didn't know if I should ever take a chance with him or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">We went through another day or two, a few days later and Tadek cames — comes again to me, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was working, and he says, “Aron, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is surrounded with heavy guards and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it looks like, is being liquidated.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Here I have, I'm <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , Lisa is <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , my family is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , I have to make up my decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Where do I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Do I go— do I believe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> or go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , live or there or go with Tadek to the unknown? </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I didn't know where I was going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I didn't hear from Hershel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I didn't hear from — what should I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">So, I have an agonizing decision to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">What do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Do you go back to Lisa? </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">All kind of thoughts come to you, and you say to yourself, “ Aron, where are you running? </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Where are you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">What's the big deal about surviving? </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So you leave everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And you almost give up <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I'm not easy to give up, but your thought comes: "It's enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">What is the purpose of surviving?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">You think and you think and meanwhile Tadek comes back and forth and he keeps asking me, “Are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And he says, "I'm going to take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Don't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I'm going to take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> tonight." </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And I say, “Tadek, I have no money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">He says, “I didn't ask you for any money." </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">He says, “I'll take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> tonight.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Meanwhile there develops another situation: The other people that are working with me are getting suspicious — maybe I want to go away with Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">We are five or six, whatever the figure was, we are going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , one missing, that's death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">If you come in with a piece of paper with six, and five are returning, that means death for the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">They start worrying, the people, and all of a sudden I see like they're guarding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">They are staying behind me, but later on I don't blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I would probably feel the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And I made my decision, 'I'm going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And this fellow, Tadek, stayed all day with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">He spent the whole day back and forth coming, begging me, and finally when I told him I made the decision, I said, "Tadek, give me your address and maybe I'll have another opportunity, I will come to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">So, he gave me the address, what I marked down on my body, on different parts of my body, I didn't want in case I'm caught to give out Tadek, and we walked back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">By that time it was seven, six o'clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">It was dark, and I'm walking with the rest of them, with a German guard, the one that took us in and out for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">He was not a Nazi, but he was just a guard to take back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And I noticed Tadek is on the other side of the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and he told me before he left, he said, "Anytime you decided to run away, follow me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And he was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> walking up until I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">But I made up my mind that I'm not going to change my mind and I came to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">By that time, I thought to myself, "Goodbye Tadek" — I couldn't say it, but I thought to myself— "goodbye Tadek, I hope I'll see you again." </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">The minute I came in, I was arrested, like with everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">A small little <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">We walked down a small <span class="DLF">street</span> right under the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Your freedom 1s all completely taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">When here I was half free, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> half free, maybe 10, 20 percent free <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , maybe I could still do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Here I am back inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They take me into the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I'm pushed in the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , packed with people who they found during the day and the people returning from work like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Everybody packed in the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I even had a hard time to move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I was looking for Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I looked around, moved around asked some people what I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I couldn't find Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And as sure as I stood there, "Why did you go back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I mean, now I'm caught right in the <span class="BUILDING">Aktion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I stayed there all night and I tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I found a couple <span class="NPIP">places</span> and I didn't accept it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I thought, "They are going to discover it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">It was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookshelves</span> — a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookshelves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I was behind, I pushed out the books in hiding in the shelves, in the back of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I kind of didn't like it, "I'll be discovered and be shot right in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">The next morning, about five o'clock in the morning, the Gestapo comes in with the <span class="DLF">doors</span> open, and we get an order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Meanwhile already inside the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> they already killed a few by shooting, by — they were shooting on the chandeliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">They <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> would have the big lights and some little children you could hear already, no mercy, killings and I'm <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the other was in four, two walked to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and I'm sure this that's, now we see it, the way people are walking innocent to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Now, here I'm a young fellow without a family, strong, looking from all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> where to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">No way could I run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Any move you would be shot immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">They keep postponing the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Maybe it will be another opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They're burning <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , "Why didn't I go with Tadek." </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And it didn't take too long, I'm at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , packed with some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">They put me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , filled up with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , maybe 60, 70 people packed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> are shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I'm <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , you can't even move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">People can't relieve themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Hungry from the few days they were laying in the different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and here I'm between. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I still have a ray of hope when I see a small little <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And with my other two friends, we were all together, the ones we were working together, and I say, “Let's see if we can jump out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">So some way we had a hard time to push through, that's how packed it was, to push through in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and come to that <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">We came to the part where the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , where the <span class="DLF">window</span> 1s, and we stood on top of each shoulders and we started with all our strength to pull the bars, metal bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Sure enough, we pulled the metal bars out, because the strength that we had at that time was like Samson with the pillars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">We could probably break a piece of iron. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">We pulled out the bars and started jumping out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I wasn't the first one to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I jumped, the second or the third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">By that time I thought, “I'm a good athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I know how to jump out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I'm already figuring out what I'm going to do. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I'm going to jump out with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the way it's running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I jump out I won't get hurt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Sure enough it didn't happen this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I jumped out and I fell down, probably on the head or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I was unconscious and the only thing I remember is being awakened by a guard, the ones who were watching the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">The German guard picked me up, put me back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , took me back inside

decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">It didn't take too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">They took me right to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .

QUESTION:  Let's back up into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , you knew Lisa wasn't there and you're still looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, and it's filling up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , during the day, I'm still looking around to see if I can find Lisa, and I was looking at other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , maybe I can find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">It's late in the day, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was already packed again, and Lisa was still not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I looked around for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , maybe I can still find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I was looking and I see a small little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that used to be the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I jump 1n this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I see a young man is making a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> under a pile of coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">There was a pile of coal, blocks of coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">He was making — trying to build a way how to hide under the coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I walked up to him and started begging him and asking him to let me make a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , together maybe we can make a <span class="NPIP">place</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">After a hard bargaining with him and asking him and pleading with him, I told him that I am a survivor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , I have some luck with me. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Plus, if you survive here, I have a Polish fellow that will take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I don't know which words worked on him, but he decided he's going to let me make the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">So, we together, we made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Like we had two <span class="DLF">walls</span> , an L shape and a pile of coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So, we used the two <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">We used like blocks, and with our luck we found a piece of plywood to make a <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We made a <span class="DLF">roof</span> on top of the blocks, two <span class="DLF">walls</span> of coal blocks and we made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> underneath and covered the <span class="DLF">roof</span> with coal again, and we found a couple of bodies, two bodies, dead bodies that we put on top of the coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">The bodies we found is a place where I wanted to hide the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">It was the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a large urn where they kept water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So, I thought, “I'm going to go in the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and hide.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And sure enough I walked out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I didn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">I thought, “The Nazis, that’s all they have to do is shoot with the urn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">He doesn't have to go and look and check the urn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">So, I went out from over there and that's where the next day somebody else took that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they were killed over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So, we found a couple bodies in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">We were hiding there <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , all of us, and during the night and the next morning, we hear the same thing what's happening the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">The Nazis came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">They took out the people from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the same orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">The only thing is, is being inside the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> 1s empty and the echo in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> you could hear real well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">You could hear only a few shots whether somebody I don't know for many reasons, but they left small babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And you hear the cry of the babies being still by the shots of the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And we are laying <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And after so much noise a few minutes before, all of a sudden the noise and the cries of the little babies are being all being quiet by the shots of a Nazi gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And we laid there the rest of the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And the next morning we heard some noise, because there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> right next to a <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And we heard some noise <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and the Nazis did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">The order was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">They're going to let a certain amount of Jews to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">That time approximately 1,000 Jews were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">We jumped out from the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and they gave us three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where to live — where the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">The three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I lived before and I came back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there I was with this friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">His name is Ruby Loren the one who survived with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">So, we — all three of us came back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to live and half an hour, an hour later, who shows up? </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Lisa shows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">She came out from the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and she came to the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with her father and little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">You can imagine the joy that we found each other and here we are back together and we started our planning how to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> , get connected to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I sent out, Lisa was the one to go out to meet Tadek because she was blonde looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">She didn't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">She went out, it was not too easy to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you go in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">It was plenty hard guarded, but some way she made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">She went out and she met Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And Lisa's brother, he went out and made a contact with Tadek all account of my address that I had and they made a first arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">Lisa's brother and father went first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">He took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And the same thing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , loaded with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And then came to the time for us and we made arrangements with Tadek to go out, a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Lisa made the arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">She went to him one time and then she went to him a second time and she met him at <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and he told Lisa that, ““We are going to meet you on a Tuesday night at seven o’clock at a <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Meet me there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">We followed his directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">We came out on a Tuesday night, but I want to turn back to one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">It's very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">We came out Sunday before, and we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">janitor house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">We were a total of us eight or nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">The janitor didn't keep us, so he took us to bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And we stayed — he didn't keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">The idea was to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">janitor's house</span> , and from the <span class="BUILDING">janitors house</span> we'll make a contact with Tadek and Tadek will take us out one by one to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">That didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">The janitor changed his mind and he forced us to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">They wanted to let us out at 12 o’clock at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">He begged us and probably he wasn't safe either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So, he kept us until five o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">He took us to a bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there we will stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Lisa, he kept her over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">That's the whole story with Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">He kept Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">For me, and the rest of us, we stayed in the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then Lisa came in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">But that day Lisa made a contact with Tadek, and she came back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">She knew where it was because when we went to the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , Lisa went with all of us, with the janitor so in case she'll need us, she'll know where we're hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">But the point that I want to make here is Tadek came and said he cannot take us tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">He may take us a day or two nights later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">We could not stay one night outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">It was more safer for us to go through the <span class="DLF">wires</span> to go back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the next day to go back out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and walk again, then to stay one day hiding in the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Because the population was so unfriendly and so Antisemitic that if a small little child was throwing a ball fall into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and then come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell him that Jews are hiding there we would immediately be given out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">It was safer for us to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">That's what was so impossible for us to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">One day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> together was much safer than to stay an hour on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And we got in touch with Tadek, Lisa got in touch with Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">The arrangements were made that Tuesday at seven o’clock we're going to meet Tadek in a <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">For that particular — it was very hard to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">We went out, five of us, knowing that he is not going to take the five anyway, but we wanted to make the contact that if we leave maybe the other ones will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">So, Ruby Loren and me and Lisa and the other two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">We all went out and we were waiting at the <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Lisa was waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and the arrangement was he was going to come with a certain signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">He's going to come and meet us at the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> and then take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Lisa talked to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">She told him we are five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">He said, “It's impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I cannot take five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">I can take two.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">After a real good talk, I walked out after two, he agreed to take three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">The third one was Ruby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And I had a hard time to talk Ruby to go with me because he did not want to go with the two us because a girl is involved too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And it's not safe to spend the rest of the time to go anyplace with a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">It's safer to be with two young people, plus he had a cousin over there that if he felt it was safer to go with his cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">I talked him in, and I dragged him at the last minute to go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Tadek agreed and he took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">The other people they made arrangements to come out two days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Two days later never came, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">They could never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">So, Ruby could never — he would never meet his cousin and his friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">How did Tadek take us? </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">We followed Tadek, so Lisa was walking with Tadek, and now we're talking about seven, seven-thirty in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">We're walking at night, and I look Jewish and Ruby looked Jewish, and every Pole would recognize us, but we kept our caps down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">The cold, covered up with a jacket, and we followed to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">He showed us, “Here, one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Over there is a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Lie down in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and I'll go find out with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> 1s going to take us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">He came a short while later and was telling us this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to go. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1350">When this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> starts moving, jump on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">He said, “You jump on the couplers between the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and some of them you'll find a small leather where you can climb up on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , otherwise you'll have to make it on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">And we followed his directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started moving, I jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">I found the coupler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I found the leather, on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">Ruby happened to do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Lisa did not do the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">What did she do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">She panicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">She was still sitting by the end in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and waiting for the right <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> which was going to take her to jumping on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">So, apparently she ran out, and there was not too many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> left, so she grabbed for the handle where the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the middle of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and that little step. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">So she jumped on the step with the handle and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started moving and she's holding on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">We don't know anything what happened with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">We're on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">We are doing our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is already going 15, 20 maybe 30 miles an hour and Tadek comes to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">He found us on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he said, “Where's the girl?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I said, “She's probably on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">She probably comes someplace, somewhere.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">He left us laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">He went all over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">He jumped one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Now, this is March, I think the third or fourth, cold winter day, frost, real cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it's a cold winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">He is right there, and we are laying on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">He's left us there and he jumped all the way on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to look for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">He found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">He came back to us and he told us we have to come to one of the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">We like him, youth was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">We jumped like he jumped and we came to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> where Lisa was hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">We made a human chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Tadek bent down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">He was skinny and light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">He bent down to be able to reach her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">I was holding his legs — his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">Ruby was holding me, because it was slippery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And we pulled Lisa up on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and he gave us, after he gave us a little vodka, he had a little briefcase, he had vodka and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And that's the way we traveled for 180 kilometers until we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">He told us before we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to jump before the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">We jumped out and we followed him — Tadek — he was going ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">He jumped out before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">He told us, “You follow me and I'll take you to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">You'll see people returning from the night, going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you'll some way get together with them and go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">We did the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">The only thing 1s we put, on our faces, we put on coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">Darkened our faces from the heavy day and night shift and walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> we saw a group of Jews going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">We joined them together and we were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1400"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> we found the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">We found the quiet time and we were arrested by the Jewish Judenrat, the Jewish police, and they took us over to their <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and they warned us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">That was Gens”° and Dessler”’ — Dessler was the one I had a session with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">So he warned me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">He said, “We'll let you stay here in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we'll accept you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">We'll let you keep over there, but we don't you should spread the rumors whatever happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">We don't want you to panic the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">If you panic the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you'll be punished.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Punished could be death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">He doesn't have to send me to death -- he can send me to death, he doesn't have to kill me, but I knew — we knew what the message was, not to spread the rumor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Now, comes a different psychology what in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Just make little observations what I felt is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being in a way being organized by the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Quite a few youths who were part of the underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">The war was going on and the Russians started losing the war already by that time and Gens, the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , had a feeling, a conviction that he might save the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">People approve of that, that's a different case, but that was his thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">The front is coming closer and if you don't provoke the Germans to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he has a chance to save the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">But at the same time the F.P.O., it means the Fareynegte Partizaner Organisatsye’®, it means under one umbrella, all the underground, got organized and was two sections in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">One was the youth in the underground and one the people want to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And you have to be one part of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">We were interested that time in survival — I mean in going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And now our survival can only go through the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">After a long, long time, I felt it long in our times, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> time, is finally we made a contact with the underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> through Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, too, and I was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> *6 Jacob Gens, head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> ’s Judenrat. *</span><span class="sentence" id="1422">7 Saulk Dessler, head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> ’s Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">8 United Partisan Organization (Yiddish); Jewish anti-Nazi underground organization established in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">with someone from Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir and in this same time another friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> we were a group of ten, what they called the Grodno Gruppe”’, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">So, we were a group of ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">We lived together, most of us in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we belonged to the same nucleus of underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">So, we got in touch and here we were part of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">So, that was the first time since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> being by myself I got another chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">I got another opportunity to join the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And here I joined with the underground and a lot of things were going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">A lot of people were pro, a lot of people were against it, for the same reason the underground provokes something with the Germans would come and liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">So, we were very, very secretive and in fact we begged them, we insisted that we want any chance we have to be able to send us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">And we went to different affairs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">There were tremendous — many happenings in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">We had the Wittenberg affair, where the Nazis caught the head of the underground organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">How they caught him is actually, they didn't catch him, they caught a Polish leader, and he gave out Wittenberg*’, and then the Nazis came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and were demanding to get Wittenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">And Wittenberg was the head of the underground, so it was going on the whole fight, should they give out Wittenberg or not and one night we got an order to meet in a certain <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , in the middle of the night, 12 o’clock, we got an order to meet to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And here we discovered that the underground is not eight Grodner*’ or 10 Grodner, but the underground is hundreds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">By that time we had three guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Our group was actually 10 so we had three guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">How did we get the guns? </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">We bought them through somebody and somebody smuggled them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">Was very expensive — we had to give up food to be able to buy, to buy the guns, but without the guns we probably wouldn't be accepted to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">Every group had to have a certain amount of spe— guns to be able to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">So, we lived through in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and going through and finally we convinced them or they were convinced by themselves, because it was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Should we send men to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or should we keep all the people, all the fighters in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to defend the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">We were the ones that didn't believe in defending the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because we thought the most it would do is kill a few Germans, but otherwise we'll all be killed out and nobody will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Our idea was to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and fight in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">They came to the conclusion too, that we couldn't do anything without their conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And they decided they are going to send out groups to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">It was no easy thing to go out to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because it was 250, 170 kilometers away and to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> you had to know where to do and this we're proud of our Jewish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">We had two Jewish young fellows where they were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , they were partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">They risked their lives to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and take out 28 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Twenty-eight Jews like me and take them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">It took us eight nights, seven nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">It took us seven nights to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with two scouts who they knew the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">We got °° Group (Yiddish) ° Yitzhak Wittenberg (1907-1943), leader of Jewish underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">3! </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">Person from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> (Yiddish) lost on the way until we found the <span class="DLF">road</span> for a whole night instead of going 10, 15 kilometers, we only went a few kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">We stopped back on the same way, but we made it all the way to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and we came there and the leader of our group was Glazman*’ and he by the way, one of the people that I lived together with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , he left for the underground a couple weeks before and we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">But when we came there, he was a Russian young man by the name of Bumky Bojarski and he was a leader in the underground already, in the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">We met him over there on the base not knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">We was surprised to find him and he was surprised to see us, but that's how secretive it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">He didn't know anything about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Now, how was life in the underground? </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">Well, the minute we came in were very happy days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">It was quite a few Jews and the idea was to form a Jewish special unit, not be together with all the other nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">We wanted to be a fighting, strong fighting Jewish unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">At the beginning they accepted it when we came, and we thought we had other — we were right with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">We thought we had other things in our mind because all of us lost all of our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">The only thing, we all had one thing in common, is not survival, I mean survival was secondary, but revenge was — fighting the revenge was our main purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Because everybody feel the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">If you'll survive, what's the big deal? </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">Nobody's around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">Everybody's gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">So, anytime when the commanders used to come in and ask for volunteers to do all kinds of missions, we were the first ones, and we were good at it because like the rest of them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> with us, were Russian prisoners, some Poles and some farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">The farmers were forced to join the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">The Russian prisoners was part of their life to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">They went to fight a war that families left, so for them I don't say they wasn't good fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">They didn't have the motives what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">For us, we were young men and women and we had the gall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">For us to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> was to fight and do as much damage, to kill Germans do damage the most we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">But Antisemitism was just there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">They learned as fast from the Nazis or from the Poles before, or it was there <span class="NPIP">inside</span> for them it was natural to be Antisemitic, so they started making fun of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And the women they thought belonged only in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="1487">They don't belong over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">They don't belong fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">What does women fighters have to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">And the man was the same thing. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1491">What is a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">A Jew doesn't even know how to keep a rifle — how to fight with a rifle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">So, we had Antisemitism was pretty strong and we had incidents where Antisemitism was almost like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because in the certain time.... Now what was our work to be done? </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">Our mission was, the first thing was to blockade the <span class="DLF">roads</span> coming to our base. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">That's where you want security. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">So, we blocked all the <span class="DLF">roads</span> coming to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">We cut down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> because we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">We cut down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and we dynamite them so they could not come into our base. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">Now, the underground was already developing pretty strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">It was numbers, bigger numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">And I'm talking all underground, not only the Jewish underground, as in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">I'll come back to the Jewish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">So, the <span class="REGION">area</span> became already quite a few partisans, were in the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> and we cut down the <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">We cut down the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">We cut down — wherever we could do is blow up their <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">In many instances we blew up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Now, if I took part in it, I took part in it directly and indirectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">But I wasn't a hero but I >? </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Joseph Glazman, Jewish partisan and leading member of the F.P.O. was part of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">I was active as anybody could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Now, with the Jewish underground, the Jewish otriad*’, more groups were coming in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">One after the others, and then they decided to disband the Jewish separate unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So, they left only a smaller amount of Jews to be together, take them in their units and then a larger group, maybe half, they put them in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">They made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">They called it proizvodstvennaya gruppa**. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">That means a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> productive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">They are going to produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">They are going to work for the other partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">So, they took all different kinds of — they were — or they made tradesmen out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">It was shoemakers, tailors, mainly bakers, a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> to bake food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">They used to bring in the flour and bake food for the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">So, they made them lower, on the same level or they would put him back on the same system, “You are lower class you're not good enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">And this was one of the best cream of our youth and they put him down to that kind of level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">But some of them, but in fact most of them didn't stay there too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">They some way went out and they found in different otriad — 1n different companies special groups where they joined so they were still able to go in and fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And they didn't take him in, in our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">And this way was happening up until a couple months later we had an oblava*’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">It means the Germans came to comb the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">Before they send the Germans to the <span class="DLF">front line</span> , they gave him the test to comb the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And that was a time when we lost a lot of people because there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> you could survive or hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">They came in with the force so the only thing you had to run away and hide in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">So, this particular time I was chosen with Lisa, I was chosen to be guards to the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">The staff for our otriad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">Otriad, is what do you call them, a big company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">The name, by the way, where we were was Kalininsky Otriad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">That was the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And the staff decided, they found out the night before that oblava, is going to comb the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">But this incident I have to mention it, it was the same thing like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">The night before, the staff, we lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , so they opened up one <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and every Jew had to come in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and they searched us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">If anything that we had which we brought from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , somebody had a watch, a golden watch, somebody had other things, I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">Somebody had good shoes or good boots, they took away a good pair of boots, from me, I didn't have a good pair of boots, but they would take a good pair of boots from me and give it to theirs, and leave maybe an old pair of torn boots or no boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And the same thing is take away everything from you and send you out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And that reminds me of the same selection that I went through in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And the next morning they took the staff went and they took about 10 people with them, and I and Lisa were part of the 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">Our job was to protect them during the night when they go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">They put guards all the way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">But this way we had opportunity to go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">We went with them through the night, and then they felt danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">They released us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">They went on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">They changed their clothes like farmers and we were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">And we went on a small little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">By luck we survived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">It was not anything °3 military detachment (Russian) ** production group (Russian) °° dragnet, round-up (Russian) special, but we survived on this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">And then after that, we came back on the base, this oblava search was going on five, six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">We came back on the <span class="BUILDING">base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">We lost another 20 percent of our good people and they took not everybody back in, being an active fighter, they took me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">They took Lisa back and Lisa was very well accepted, so she had less problems than somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">This way we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">What we did, we had to fight, we had to attack some garrisons with other partisans, with other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">But that was our life in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1562">QUESTION:  So, you had arms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1563">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1564">QUESTION:  So, you went out and fought?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1565">ANSWER:  Yes, we had arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">Even in the beginning we had very little arms, but then in months later, we had an <span class="BUILDING">aerodrome</span> , what we made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">We cut out a big <span class="DLF">field</span> where the Russians used to come in the middle of the night, and we used to put up four fires in different <span class="NPIP">parts</span> and they used to drop ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And it didn't take too long that we had enough arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">So, they had known from the beginning their excuse for the Jews not to take them in because we didn't have any arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">Later on, there was no excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">We had plenty of arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">There was no shortage of arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">It was already so organized that we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> landed and take out wounded and take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">So, it was real, real organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">It helped to break the back of the German army, because not only with us, but then it was going on for maybe I think the figures are, there was more than 1,000,000 partisans, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">I'm not talking about our <span class="REGION">area</span> , I'm talking as a whole <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">It was tremendous, big power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1578">QUESTION:  What about food? </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">How did you get food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1580">ANSWER:  Food was no big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">When we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with the partisans we were almost like the king of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">The king of the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">We used to go in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> come in with a gun at night and if they had food, we got their food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">So, food was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">But it was friendly farmers and unfriendly farmers, so we had to go farther away where it was unfriendly farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">One more thing that I want to mention is our job what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">I think 1t was very important in our vicinity, we had Jews, singles and even some of them were families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">But they run away from massacres and they were on the periphery of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">Some of them hiding in <span class="DLF">farms</span> , some of them living in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">When we discovered them, we took some of them, we took out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we put them in the <span class="DLF">farms</span> and the farmer knew, “You have to keep him, you have to protect him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">If not, if we come and...,” he knew, that was a language he understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">You didn't have to tell him that. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1593">You have to keep him safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">If we come to your <span class="DLF">farm</span> and we don't find the people, your <span class="DLF">farm</span> is going to be burned, all your cow and your horse” — that was his main possession — “would be killed or taken away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">The message was clear. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1596">You have to protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">You have to hold them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">They all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">Anybody when we got in touch with them, and we felt very good about it that we could help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">We had families living that we helped to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1601">QUESTION:  And the other partisans, non-Jewish partisans didn't prevent you from doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1602">ANSWER:  They didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1603">QUESTION:  What about some of the leaders of your group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1604">ANSWER:  Some of the leaders, we had leaders from the beginning we had leaders that they dropped them by <span class="DLF">air</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parachutes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">So, they were Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">Some of our leader was Glazman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">He was the leader from the F.P.O. He was killed for only one reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">He didn't like what the Russians are doing with the Jews in our partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">He was the head of our Jewish otriad, and after they took away all the power from us, he was terrible disgusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">So, he decided he's not going to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">He is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> to send <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudnisky</span> , that's another wooden area where they send some of the partisans went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naroch</span> , that's where we were, and some went to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rudnisky forest</span> , they called it pushcha*®. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">So, he decided he's going to take a group and he's going to leave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">We were part already of the Russians anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">There was no Jewish leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">They took away the Jewish leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">So, he felt he wanted to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , to the other group and on the way, he was killed with the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">Only one young girl survived and she came back and told us about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1618">QUESTION:  What did you think about the Russian partisans? </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">I mean, how do you feel in the end about the whole —?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1620">ANSWER:  We were very, very disappointed for not having our own unit we were blocked with many things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">So, in kind of a way you lost your quest to fight your own way, but we did it in the same way because our purpose was to fill out what we were going for it, but it took away the — how do you explain it, the morale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">It didn't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">But in the same way, I would have to say that not every Russian was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">We had friends in the Russian who were just as us and we were friendly and brotherly the same way like anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">So, it's not a question — we had bad experience with different type of groups, but we had good people, we had nice people with them all over like the same thing like we met at <span class="BUILDING">Polish Tadek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">The same thing we had Russians that were — in fact by myself the Russian people are a nice people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1627">QUESTION:  Why did Tadek do what he did, do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">Or did you ever find out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1629">ANSWER:  Well, why he did is that's what he told us a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">You know Tadek? </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">We brought Tadek to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we are still in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">He went to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and talked to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and he belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , the Nuns of Nazareth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And he kind of believed he says — and they asked him the question, and he says “What else could I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">If I see a person I can save especially I had friends that I played with them before the war,” it wasn't particularly us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">He said, “They were nice people and if I can help him why shouldn't I?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">He feels “I'm not a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">I didn't do anything special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">I did what I felt a person should do,” and what he does he blames, °° virgin forest (Russian) “If I could only point my finger it’s to the people the ones that did not help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> ?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">he was speaking he say, “I accuse the people the ones who could help and did not help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1641">QUESTION:  We have a little tiny bit of time left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">After it all ended you went back and what did you find and were there any pogroms after — ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1643">ANSWER:  Yes, after liberation came for us in 1944, the Russians liberated us in time of liberation we lost three of my best friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">On the day of liberation we got an order to collect German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">We were caught out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with a group of well trained army officers, because they were army officers and they — with them, too a couple plain soldiers, but the rest of them were well armed from the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">They were already <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">So, we got the order to catch them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">And we followed them and we put a couple ambushes under them, so we killed quite a few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">That's what we know where they were and was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">By the end when it came evening, they were well trained, they put ambush on us in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they killed Lutek, Lazer and Benchke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">Three of my best friends were killed already we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">From there I made my business to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> I found a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">Nobody was left out of the 20,000 I could only find two or three Jews were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">For some reason they came to check, to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">Nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">I had a woman, I mean a neighbor, a Tatar — Muslim and she was very, very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">My father helped her all his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">In time of the war we helped her, too, I mean before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">And she's supposed to help us in time in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">She did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">We left some clothes in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">We thought maybe it's the place if we need we'll come and take some clothes and then trade it for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">She did not give us in time when now we needed it and now, when we came after the war, she was very unfriendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">I'm talking here about a person what her father and her family lived with my family for one hundred years, probably for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">So, anyway, I could feel it's like a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">I didn't stay there long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">I stayed only one night and one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">From there I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">From <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , well <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I mean that was White Russian, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it's in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> but then it's an established part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> I got connected to the B’richa**. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">B’richa it was organization which was sent out from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , that time, it was not <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> yet, so they send out Jewish young men and women to save survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">So, we got in touch with them and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> we got directed to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">B’richa</span> to go try to go past, to the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">So, they arranged for us papers from the Red Cross that we are Greeks and we are returning <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this way we could make the voyage from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span
