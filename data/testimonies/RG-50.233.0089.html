<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Arthur R. Menke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the year 1927, February 234,
QUESTION:  Why don’t we start off by you telling me a little bit about your childhood and your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I had a father whose age was at that time 55 and my mother at that time was 46 and I had a sister at the age of 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  You had one sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And that was the only sibling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We lived in a very nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we had to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we lived in because Jews were no longer allowed in that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It was too good for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What time frame are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  That was, I would say, in about, ’38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  "38?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Up until that time, I know this is going to be hard to try to remember, especially because you were that young, but do you remember any of the time, around the time that Hitler came to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Of course, I was born in ’27 but I vividly remember say around °35 and that’s when the Jews were starting to suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And it was maybe around ’38 when the Jews, like I said, were resettled in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were not allowed to shop in regular <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> assigned especially to Jews with the merchandise was higher. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We were also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> which said “no Jews allowed’. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">You couldn’t go to a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And there were severe restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I’m sure you recall Crystal Night, I don’t think we have to get into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I’m sure you know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When the German official was killed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and that was supposed to be a punishment to punish the Jews for that and that’s how Crystal Night originated and at that time my father was taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to arrest my father and he was at the place of business and ordered my mother not to contact him and they went and arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And he came back after six weeks a broken man. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He was hardly recognizable. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And at that time the Nazis had taken over all German owned businesses and they were government run, so my father’s business, he had a small <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> producing rubber and signs, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">and that business was taken over by the government and his bank account was taken and we were only allowed to draw a small amount of our own money at the time and my father was forced to work as a laborer packing shoes in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Do you remember when you were a small child, about this time, was there a lot of anti-Semitic overtones, by the children, especially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Well, the anti-Semitism, it was a lot worse in smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , as a matter of fact, it was so bad that the people who lived in smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> went to the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> because there was less anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Now, the German Jew, if you want to use the term integrated, he was not like the Polish Jew who was discriminated by the Poles many, many years before the German Jew was. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And so, the German Jew was a proud German. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Like my father fought for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1914-18 and was discharged a proud German soldier defending his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And the German Jews were dumb enough to believe that what’s happened to the Polish Jews, because the Polish Jews suffered sooner than the German Jews. “</span><span class="sentence" id="35">Oh, this will never happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We are German, first before we are Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But I recall being taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">German high school</span> called “Talmud Torah” which 1s still standing today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  That was a <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And they also had a <span class="BUILDING">girl’s school</span> where my sister went. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was a highlik a real fine <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we were well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Of course that was too good for the Jews again and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was taken over by the Germans and we were all forced into a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Of course, there was a lot of immigration at that time and my mother saw the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and wanted to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But I recall saying to my father, “ you don’t have a trade, it would be difficult to start over again’ so they procrastinated until 1t was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We did try to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the late ‘30’s but it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  You said something earlier about being moved within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Was that a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> set up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where more Jewish people lived already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Before the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> I lived in was on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> which was a much nicer <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  And they moved you into
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I was not welcome at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> either, any more, I was going to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Do you remember when you moved, what kind of feelings you had at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Well, as a child, it didn’t bother us at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But of course, it was a terrible thing for my parents to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">As a matter of fact, we had a real nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and at first we all lived, the whole family, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">rented room</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a trauma, at that time already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Let’s see, you talk a little bit about Kristallnacht, do you remember anything specific about that night that happened to you or your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Well, I know that all the Jewish businesses were totally destroyed including huge <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> like <span class="BUILDING">Hecht Company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Hashta is the name all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> today and they taken furs and threw them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and the people that owned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The strange part is that my father’s business was not destroyed because people didn’t realize that my father was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So his business was not destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Is there any reason for that, that they might not think that he was a Jew or did they just not know, is that
ANSWER:  They did not realize that he was a Jew and like I said earlier, the German Jew was first German. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I want to tell you a little incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">There was a Nazi holiday and of course the Jews would not display their flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My sister and I would make a flag out of a sheet and hang out which my parents naturally reeled back in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Just to give you a sample like there was no difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Do you remember much about any friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that you had at that time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , especially from the children if there were any anti-Semitic
ANSWER:  Yes, because they were agitated by their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We had to wear a Star of David with the name Jew written in and the letters were made in such a way that they looked like Hebrew, said German Jew, and it had to be worn on the outer clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  From what time was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  That started also in the late ‘30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I would say °38 and the kids would throw stones, you know kids are cruel and not being allowed to go many <span class="NPIP">places</span> , was a hardship on the kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Do you remember what life was like, we’re not talking about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> here but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> you moved to, was it guarded by the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Was it free going back and forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Yes it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And even at that time there were plenty Germans who were not Nazis but they were scared not to be Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I remember as a little boy I worked 1n a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> they were selling health food and I took the deliveries for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Beautiful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But I also remember taking the packages to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , other kids would tear the labels off, you know, being Jewish, and causing problems and things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  How did you work at this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  It was a little part-time job. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">After <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There were Germans that my family knew who befriended us who were strictly against the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I'll tell you how bad it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One child remarked in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he overheard his parents the night before saying that some law that Hitler made was ridiculous or, I can’t get the detail; anyway this man, this Christian man, gentile man, was arrested by the German Gestapo and eight weeks later his wife received an urn of ashes, they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So the kids were scared of their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You were not allowed to listen to foreign broadcasts, like <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> were separate, so neighbors would turn other neighbors in that they were listening to foreign broadcasts and they were severely punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You inquired of what type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Well, it was not a bad <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> were difficult to find and we didn’t live as nice as we did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We didn’t starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was just a different type of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We were under pressure all the time like we were an enemy of your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And like I said earlier, a lot of people started to deport, they had enough sense to get out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Did a lot of people, were they able to get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Was it more restricted as time went on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Well, there was a point where Hitler wanted the people to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Of course, they had to have visas in order to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They had to be sponsored. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So that sometimes created a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You had to have someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They also had Jewish organizations, I think it was HIAS and others that assisted Jews from leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And then of course, you had to have a certain amount of money to leave and since my own bank account, my father’s bank account was taken over, at that time, 1t was almost impossible to leave so when we wanted to leave in the late ‘°30’s, we couldn’t leave anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My father wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , that’s what he hoped to do but it didn’t work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  You talked about freezing your bank accounts. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Were you allowed an allowance, is that how it worked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  To the best of my knowledge, he was allowed a certain amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  A certain amount a month or a week?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Yes, but it wasn’t enough so my father had to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  You said before that there was no real hunger in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that you were in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There was food and everything was available and there was food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">There was no real hardship like I said earlier, there was only certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> where Jews could do their shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They were state operated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  All the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> they could go to or were certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> with certain hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> at certain hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They were operated by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Why don’t we move on here to your deportation? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Tell me a little that. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">How it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  It happened you received a letter through the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">As a matter of fact, the postman knew of these letters and he normally would ring the doorbell when he had mail for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He didn’t do it this time because he was a decent guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The contents of the letter would give us an order to vacate our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> within so many hours and we were allowed so many pounds per person to take with us and then we were told in that same letter that we had to take our own key to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to take to the <span class="BUILDING">local police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I also want to add this that the gold and furs and other things, we had to turn in earlier already, anything of value.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  They seized your valuables.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  They seized. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Of course, some people didn’t give it all up but there was a drive for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So when we received our notice, we bought warm socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I think we were allowed 100 pounds at first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  What did you bring, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  You know, a backpack. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Sweaters, warm underwear, clothing, extra shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And we had to report to a <span class="BUILDING">Masonic temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Now I might want to add that the <span class="BUILDING">Masonic temple</span> was also against the law to exist and my father was a mason and he went to secret meetings even.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Freemason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And we went to this <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , which the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> was all marble and completely destroyed on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And we laid on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for the night and the Germans ordered us any cash money we had to turn in, any rings and so on, they made a last little pitch to get the stuff off and that was the first time we were guarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We were loaded on open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and loaded into regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and everything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and everything in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They were old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , most had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Some had to lay on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And we traveled I believe it was three days and three nights to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Let me back track just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When the letter came, did they give you any indication as to where you might be going, what you might be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  I think we were told we were going to the east to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Okay, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Now, I may have mentioned earlier that many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> were killed right on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  And that’s where you arrived, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Yes, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , it was <span class="REGION">White Russia</span> , German occupational Russia. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Most people don’t understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  What time frame, what are we talking about, what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  And that’s when you were deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Okay, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> we were marched, it was very cold, we were marched into an <span class="REGION">area</span> which was at one time a <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Now we were a transport of a 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">That <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> was at that time occupied by Russian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And they had to vacate that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to put us into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It appeared that at one time it was a fairly modern <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It had running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The faucets didn’t work, the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> didn’t work but you could tell it was a regular <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> like we almost have in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we already saw a lot of dead people on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> at this time, Russian Jews that were killed by the Germans that didn’t evacuate the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> fast enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  They were in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or around the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  They were in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was part of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  And this was in the wintertime, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  It was in the wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And we then gathered old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and stuff and we stayed 1n that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and there was another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , other small out <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and that’s where we stayed at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Did you go out and work from there, 1s that what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  The first couple of days I don’t think we did but then we were put to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">As a matter of fact, we had to build our own <span class="DLF">fences</span> to go around there. </span>
