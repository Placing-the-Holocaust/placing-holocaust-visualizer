</span><span class="sentence" id="2122">But | was, from 1939 until really we run out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , | just, | was a smart child. </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">| didn't want to play with children, that's all | did, is reading, reading, reading, reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">Polish, Hebrew then and Russian, from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">| didn't play with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">Even for the two years when the Russians were there, | was also very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">And though, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> | am a happy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">People think I'm a very happy, outgoing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">But certain things | don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">| was six months with those peasants, when my father was in the partisans, and | remember nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">| don't Know what | ate there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">| don't remember, | just remember sleeping on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and burning my flesh, was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">But the rest of it, and then when they came to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">| don't even remember when they left me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">| don't remember what | ate, what did | do? </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">They didn't keep me for nothing, | must have been either with the sheep in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> or helping, doing something with the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">| must have. </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">And chunks like this of my life, like they are just out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">| don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">Completely out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">That's the story of a survivor, my dear. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">But unfortunately, every week is different funerals. </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">If Hitler would come up, would wake up now, and see that we still, we have a lot of green-na (ph), survivors, who lived a long, long age and lived a beautiful generation, left a beautiful generation of people, lawyers, doctors, politicians, on television, he would drop dead again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">And every time, | use to have a speech, I'm good in those things, | have to get it out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">If Hitler would wake up and see what we are doing here and the generation we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">We left, believing beautiful people behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">A beautiful generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">This is just the first generation, how about the second generation?
