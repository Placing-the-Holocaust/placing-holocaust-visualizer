</span><span class="sentence" id="20">Courtier? </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh...He was selling for other diamonds and...uh...uh...life became easier and...uh...1 was going as a child in...uh...in the...and my first language was French so I went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and on Wednesday afternoon and Sunday morning I went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My brother went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> for...uh...the whole day where he learned Hebrew and Jewish and...uh...French and Flemish. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh...in...in 1940 when I finished...uh...no...let's go back to 1937...uh...when I came to American. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">To tell you the story why we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is because...uh...by great grandfather died here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They came, I think, after the First World War here with all the children but my grandmother was already married in...uh...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> so she was...uh...I think she was the oldest daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So she remained with her husband and her children there in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">This is why I have...uh...in reality I am a third generation already American because... uh...my family is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So my father came here to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to...for the question of the inheritance. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And he liked it so much because he found all the family here that he didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">His cousins, his uncles...uh...1t was...uh...very happy situation for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So he wanted to immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we immigrated really to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in September of 37. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">For me as a child it was a shock because it was in the depression era and...uh...we lived in the <span class="REGION">low east side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We...compared to what...how we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> or...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , was a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was a misery compared to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And...uh...although I...I loved to be with all these cousins that I didn't know but...uh...unfortunately they send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...uh...as a....with the beginners. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was already 10 at the time and it was very hard for me because I didn't spoke the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My brother, who was three years older, and finished already <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , immediately entered to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and instead to be in the sixth...I don't know...in the first year, they sent him immediately in the third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I don't know to compare that with the American. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So he was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was very unhappy here, and I cried a lot and...uh...it...because it was a very difficult time at that time with the depression and my...my mother and father had a lot of difficulties making out. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So we came to the conclusion that...uh...maybe it would be easier for my father if we send...we went back...uh...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and...uh...this is what they decided to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We went...me and my brother and my mother, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and my father stayed here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My mother was from...uh...the...from <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> , and she spoke a beautiful Polish and beautiful German and she was great admir... admirer of...uh...of German poetry from Heine and...uh...and she sang German Lieders to me, so I... never studied German, but I do speak and I do understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And...uh... she never believed that...uh.... German with their culture could do anything to the Jews she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Although we saw all the people coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939, she said...but...it's not so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My father was very scared because he heard all the rumors and he came to bring us back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in September of 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And my mother refused to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She said, "Not back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You come back to...to Europe." </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My father said, "No," so he stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So unfortunately because of this...uh...dispute between them we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Uh...The German invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in the beginning of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I think...uh...around the 10th of May...I cannot know exactly...uh...and 10 days later we...my mother decided we cannot stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh...It was the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So we took some of our possessions and we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> direction of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped at the...uh...I don't know how you say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">At the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  At the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And...uh...we couldn't take...uh...although we had little...few surtcases and we started to go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and walk in...because we didn't know where we wanted to go, but as far as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And we started to walk through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moucron</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I remember the <span class="DLF">border</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moucron</span> , and we walked with the suitcases and with a lot of other people who were stopped there too who...and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amiens</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambrai</span> and...uh...it took us about two weeks under the bombing...the uh...the German with...uh... How do you say that their...their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> they were...uh...shooting at us and we were...had to run in the...uh...1n the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> for...for protection and a lot of people were killed in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But...uh...finally we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> where they put us in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">No, it was more a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> where they had <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> and where we slept and we stayed there for a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And...uh...then the German occupied all <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so we had to go to...towards...uh... normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So we...my mother rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I remember it was rue Solferino 142. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It's funny how my memory can remember certain things and ___ others. </span><span class="sentence" id="70"><span class="BUILDING">Rue Solferino 142</span> , and not far from there, I had my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And my husband went to his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And...uh...my mother had a little money so for a time things were alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We lived...uh...and...uh...and days went by and the years went by because it was from May 40 til...1 cannot say exactly when the Germans started to do all the miseries. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I think it was from...uh...the beginning of 42. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh...they asked us to register as Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We were forced to wear the...the Jewish...uh...star and...uh...we obeyed what we were...uh...uh...we're supposed to do and...uh...life went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Unfortunately, my...my brother had a birthday in July 42 and for his birthday my mother bought...brought... bought him...uh...a trench coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And...uh...this trench coat, unfortunately, cost him his life because...uh....the Jews were forced to...couldn't go where they wanted in a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was one <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> where the Jews could go and where they gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And...uh...my...uh....my brother was a very quiet boy and very shy and very straightforward, very honest...uh...no haughtiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh...he played there...him with his friend, he played chess there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And one day when he was playing there...uh...the guy of the Gestapo came and asked...uh...to whom does belong that trenchcoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And my father..my brother stupidly answered, "It's mine." </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And...uh...there was no Jewish...uh...cross...uh...Star of David on it, so they took him to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My mother immediately went to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She saw the guy of the Gestapo, and begged him to release him and say...telling him it was his birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It's a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He had it on his suit, the Star of David, but not on the coat so. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They...they wouldn't release him. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Uh...he stayed in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It's a section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> , and from there they sent him to...through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There were a few of them that were taken at the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I know well that he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because one of the guys who was taken together with him came back, and he told me that he was well liked with the German...they liked him because he...he has such a serious...uh...he was a serious nature, so he did whatever he had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And he was alive til July 1944 because...uh...he saw him at that time and then he...they were separated, and he doesn't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz- Birkenau</span> , and he gave me his number, but I cannot remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He...uh...1 know that for a fact that he was waiting because he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but he was very little...a baby when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> so he didn't know the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So he was waiting... uh...all the family there, and he introduced himself to the family so he...he learned to know his family...and between them was a cousin who...who...to whom he told that he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> and...uh...and that we...me and my mother, we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So after the war, this cousin by accident met...uh...a girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and...uh...uh...he himself was the son of a very extremely rich man who had <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and...and...uh...uh...<span class="DLF">petroleum pit</span> .... I don't know how you call that...uh...so he sold something and...uh...because he...he couldn't take the money so he bought some gold and put it in his shoe and because he didn't want to go directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , he came through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and was looking a way to go through the...uh...frontier. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And when he passed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> , he remembered...he remembered that he had an aunt there, so he went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and asked if there was a Mrs. Zupnik here. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And he found us. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And he told us that he saw my brother there in the concentration, but he lost him also in 44, and he doesn't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Uh...and he went to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened to you and your mother after your brother was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Because...uh...my mother went to the German Gestapo, she was scared to do anything because she thought if she would escape...she would run away, there would be retaliation against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We continued for one month our life and on the evening of Yom Kippur 1n...uh....1n very early in the morning, two men of the Gestapo came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and...uh...took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My mother put some stuff, some money away, and gave it to the...the lady...uh...where we lived to put it way in case...uh... uh...we escaped...uh...we wouldn't be without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, but the story that happened is really like a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We went to the...uh...<span class="DLF">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The German took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> where there were about 3,000 families...Jewish family were there and...uh...from the early morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was a very hot day. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We stayed...uh...there at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> waiting what the German would do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I saw a lot of people because it was the eve of the holidays, they went to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and brought back chicken and food and it was like an entertainment party, and suddenly I see my mother and she said, "Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We have to go somewhere." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And she says...and I said, "No, I...1 have my friends here. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I want to stay here." </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Said, "Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You have to come." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I followed my mother and we were taken to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...uh...a very tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We were about 13 persons there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And the <span class="DLF">door</span> they put wood on the <span class="DLF">door</span> so the Germans wouldn't know that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">After awhile, we heard...uh...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...uh...leaving and the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> was very quiet because...uh...3,000 people do a lot of noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we stayed there and it was a very scary night because we had a few...a few men who were very nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was a <span class="DLF">window</span> and we heard the Gestapo walking back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And...uh...I was...uh, I was already 14 at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Who...who came to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  A man...a man of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And he asked her, "Do you want to be saved?" </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And my mother said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And as a matter of fact I asked my mother later, "How come that you decide to...to be saved because you were scared...uh...that something would happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Well...then she answered me, "I realized at that time there was nothing any more to be lost because they were taking us so I wanted to save you and myself." </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And so we were...uh...put in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and men are men...very selfish...some people start to...want to smoke cigarettes and they put the lights and the matches and we were scared...uh...terribly because...uh...they could see the lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So we stayed...uh...1n..uh...all night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I think around 1 o'clock men came through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They put a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and they took us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And since that time we were taken over by the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They took us...which is...uh..very curious story. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And it is an explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They took us to a <span class="BUILDING">whore house</span> because this where people who were...the whores. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I didn't know, but they have very big hearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They (pause)...they are known for that...that...that they will do lot of things for...to save people. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">whore house</span> for a few days, and we saw the underground coming back with guns and all things and it was a very scary story. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And then they came back with ...uh...false identification for me and my mother and for the other peoples and we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I, as a girl, young girl, I could go to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My mother could not, unfortunate, for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So she had to go on her own and...uh...it was very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">She told me that many times she slept in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">She had no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">She was in the hiding and for her, the situation was worse because she went to the Gestapo and they knew her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And she had the false identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Uh...they gave me the name... kept my...uh...my...uh...real date of birth because I was scared to...uh...to be mixed up, and I became Helene Delcombre. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And...uh...1 went to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and...uh...they were very nice to us and I[...uh...my mother was...uh... worried because I was going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and for her the studies was a very important thing so she made me...uh... subscribe at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you could send..uh... <span class="BUILDING">correspondence school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But it wasn't working. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And I stayed there from...from September til...I think a little bit after the Easter holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Then from...and...uh...I heard a lot of times that the German were coming in...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> looking for Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There I met a lot of other Jewish children and I met a girl that I knew and I know a lot of babies were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">A lot of people of saved that we don't know about it but...uh...uh....one person were telling the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Just by ear we found out that...uh...that the French people were extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And...uh...to them when they...when the people say that they were anti- Semites, they didn't even know what it was to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They thought we were....uh...like...uh...des Auvergnats.' </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They were cheap with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It's a part of section of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where people are very...I don't know the right expression...one penny is a penny. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They don't want to spend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So they thought Jews are like these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So to say that they were anti-Semite, it's the wrong thing because they didn't even know that...uh...what exactly is a Jew and physically the Jews looked like I and my mother who comes from an extremely religious fam...family. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">She looks like a Polish girl, like a Polish peasant with...uh...the cheeks and the nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh...it's
