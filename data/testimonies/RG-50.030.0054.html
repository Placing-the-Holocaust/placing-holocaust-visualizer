<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  In the years prior to the Dutch...to the German invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 1940, what was the Jewish feeling like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  I don't remember before. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Of course, I remember...I was still very young...uh the time that Hitler came in power, into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I remember friends of my parents who had experienced already, '33, '34, and fled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...coming to my parents and saying, uh, "Get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Pick up everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Come along with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We are going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But my mother used to say, "Here, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , is such a wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There's such freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Nothing will ever happen here." </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So when 1940 came, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I...as I said, my mother came from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She came from, uh, Saint Louis, the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> , and had family living...still brothers...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basle</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ] and I was going to visit one of them with another two cousins of mine, at the time a little bit older. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That was in '39, and I was fifteen, and we went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we stayed there with my aunt and uncle, had a wonderful time, until one night my parents called. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That must have been September. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">At that time...September '39...at that time, uh, the military were mobilized here, mobilization, as they say; and my parents told us to get back the next day, soonest, uh, opportunity...get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I don't know whether my aunt and uncle told them, "Come here," because that I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I don't recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But I went...we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The three of us went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Well, then later on I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The other two didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But, uh, people didn't believe it would be so bad and it would...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> was a stronghold, a democratic stronghold...nothing would happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That was the overall opinion of most people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  What happened in 1940, after the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  That was a total surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And, uh, I remember that at first we walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We looked at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Nobody actually understood what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The reality came soon enough; and, uh, then fear started slipping in then, and eating at everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Uh the fear of the unknown, the fear what would happen and stories that had been told by Germans that had left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , uh, but people still hoped for the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They were Dutch Jews and they were...nothing would happen to the Dutch Jews and this only could happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but never here. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That still persisted...that that overall feeling of here we will be OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And, uh, I remember, uh, a bomb fell in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> was bombed, and I think one stray bomb fell in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and people were sitting in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and their, uh...<span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> ...there were no <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Maybe, yes, some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> but they were hiding and trying to get away from <span class="DLF">windows</span> and they didn't want to be seen; and there was fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I remember we all slept together on one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> ...my father, my mother, my brother, my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh, we had a girl who did the home-work [the housework], a maid...sleeping-in maid...and we had somebody else who tended the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and, uh, she also had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we all were down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and, uh, it was...it was a very fearful something, because you felt the fear from your parents and, uh, yah...it was a very unpleasant, unsettling, fearful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Of course, the Germans, the uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Now I don't know exactly the date, but shortly after, things seemed to normalize and then the Germans had folders, big huge folders put on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> that, uh, the Dutch Jews, they could sleep at ease. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They could be at ease, because they were Dutch Jews and nothing would happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They didn't have to fear the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They would be regarded as the Dutch, and, uh, so they could all go and tend to their own business as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Well, a sigh of relief for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I mean, as a child I wasn't so interested 1n politics; but the overall fear that had taken...yah, that crept under your skin, that did did...it never left you, and...but you became...adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You adjusted to the circumstances and for a while life seemed to go on as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Then, after awhile, they played it so smart...so I don't know...I don't have the words for it...they played it in a way that everybody believed what was being told and was being printed and being said...
QUESTION:  Who played it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  The Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh, the Jews were not allowed anymore on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> , not in <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They were kept away from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They had to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at certain hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They...then they had...non-Jews were not allowed anymore to stay with Jewish people...Jewish people were not allowed to visit non-Jews...a separation became as a wake, suddenly, between the people who were your friends and people you had lived with all...all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And it went from one thing to another and finally people...I, I forget to tell that right after the invasion, a lot of people had tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">For instance, in the first days after 1940, after the May occupation, I know, for instance, my parents also tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I go back now to a few days after May 10th, uh...because the, the images come up and they don't come in...you know...1n order. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Flies back and forth there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But, uh, my parents, too, ...they tried to escape with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They had to wait because the friends were coming and they...believe it or not they came with valises full of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Because...you know...nobody understood what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They thought they could take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and they could drive to the Hook of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ljmuiden</span> , and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But then by the time my parents and they got a... don't know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> or whatever it was, it was some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh, we all were piled in and we drove but soon the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> couldn't go any...anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Nobody could get through, and the few people that got away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ljmuiden</span> , they were just the lucky ones, if they made it to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and the rest had to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So there was a try, there was.... People tried to escape then, but later on they adapted to the rules and, uh, they hoped for the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Did you or any of your family members try to leave Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  At that moment...afterwards, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Only at that moment, at that ttme when most people tried to escape, but afterwards there was no opportunity, there was no way out because, uh, very soon <span class="DLF">borders</span> were closed and, uh, no...1t was very dangerous and a parent didn't want to endanger his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh, parents had parents too, older people they didn't want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was...it is an involved thing to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">To get up and leave 1s a terrible thing, because you have to be thinking only of you, your children and maybe if your parents can go, but you cannot take the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It...1t breaks you in in two pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It's terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  What was the feeling like in the community after the Queen fled the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Hope that the Queen would survive and that the Queen could do something and that the Queen would take care of us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But it meant...well, it meant..."My gosh, she left!" </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">That was unheard of...terrible! </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Not that she left, but understood because the Queen was a symbol of uh beauty, honesty. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Uh, the Queen was looked upon as a wonderful, wonderful person, the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I think most of the Jews were very royal-minded, at least in my, uh, surrounding, you know, so when she left it was quite a shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  After the Germans had invaded and the anti-Jewish laws were put into effect, what did the Nazis do to the townspeople?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  It took awhile before they started, uh, getting at persons, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They had laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You were not allowed to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You were not allowed to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You were not allowed to buy here, to go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , to have non-Jews, to be with non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Uh, I don't know at what time...I couldn't pinpoint the date when they said, uh, businesses had to be taken care of by...they called it "Verwaltung" [Translation: "administration" at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">That was somebody, they set in place of the owner, of the director of the business so the, the director or owner had to get out and they put somebody else in place, and a lot of people...I know my father did...he had a big...yah business, import/export shoes and wholesale and he also in <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> ...uh, I know my father got in touch with, uh, one of the manufacturers of shoes who had become a close friend through the years and talked with him, a man he could trust, and this man recommended his own bookkeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He gave my father his own bookkeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">At the time they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deurne</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Brabant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was quite a distance away, and he actually gave this man out of the goodness of his heart--with the consent of the man, of course, and his family because they had to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> --and he conducted the business from then on, and my father trusted this man implicitly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Was this man Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Yes, he was Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Only Christians could do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">No Jews were allowed to uh conduct somebody else's Jewish business, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  So he ran the business for your father?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  What was the reaction and the response of the townspeople of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> to everything that was happening? </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Fear, because by now it was clear that the intentions were not so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Uh, I remember '41, the razzia. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That was the first one in June '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Uh, when a cousin of mine--the one I had been with to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> --was picked up from the <span class="DLF">street</span> because at that time it seemed that a German had been shot and I think that was the reason, the reason for the razzia. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They picked up a number of Jewish young men from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and sent them to uh...yah...what was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp?</span> ...uh, 1t comes to my mind later on....

"</span><span class="sentence" id="233">Let's try." </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So she went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Uh, she went to an address...the address was Rusland, "<span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ," near the <span class="BUILDING">Konigsberg Hall</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to a <span class="BUILDING">paper factory</span> or something what was there; and, uh, there she stayed and her fiancé went every day, went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> not too far away from her because at that time you couldn't stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That wasn't being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That wasn't...1t was unheard of, so later on they did...they stayed together later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They had a heck of a horrible time, but later on...so [Yetty (ph)| left. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">My sister's name is [Yetty (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I...1n '42, the Directrice, Miss Pimentel, she wanted me me...she wanted three girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Sieny Kattenberg, Betty |Hausmit (ph)]...no, Betty [Oudgekirk (ph)] it was at the time, and [Bonnie Philips (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There were three girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Because in every class...you have some outstanding people. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I wouldn't say because of of intellect, but because they are just their personality or they have something... and she picked us, and she made me head of a department because children started coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Meanwhile, people from the razzias were being brought to the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> and the Germans didn't want the noise of the children and they couldn't, uh...it was a horrible situation there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It was awful.</span></p>

QUESTION:  When you said by the end of that, by the end of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  By the end, uh...that was '42...beginning '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Uh, when the...when I had done the exam, taken the ex...exam and that meant I was now...I had a degree... you can't call it a degree, but children's care. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So, uh, as I said, three girls were staying there permanently; but before that, I forget...there was a nasty incident, because my sister was 1n hiding and my father got in touch with somebody who told him he could take his daughters and bring them over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and would take care that they would come in, uh, with the "Maquis" or under...underground organization and to get them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">That would cost three thousand guilders a child, and my father took care that the money was there, because he had money hidden because they had to give in all the money to Lipmann and Rosenthal,’ to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They had to...silver or whatever they had...radios, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , whatever...they had to, uh, deliver at a certain point. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">That was all German property from now on, but he kept hidden money, some money, and he gave this to this man to take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The man didn't dare to take me because I was raven black, my hair was; so I had to be... had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> and have my hair done, and that was done in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And it so happened he took me to an, an NSBer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="284">An NSBer was...was somebody who was on the wrong side of the...of Lipmann, Rosenthal & Company was an organization used by the Germans for the express purpose of milking the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">According to Law No. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">148/1941, which was passed in December 1941, Jewish financial assets--cash, checks, bank deposit, etc.--were to be transferred to, and managed by Lipmann-Rosenthal. * </span><span class="sentence" id="287">A member of the Nationaal Socialistische Bewegung (NSB), a Dutch Nazi movement founded in 1931 by Anton Adriaan Mussert. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Antisemitic and pro-German, the members of the NSB collaborated closely with the German occupation regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">decency, he was a pro-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Nothing was said. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He must have paid him quite a lot of money but when I was sitting in front of the mirror I saw my hair getting from from black to red, from red to yellow-orange. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was...finally it was orange. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I was in shock, but it had to be done because the man wouldn't take me otherwise, so, uh, we went the next day and we walked and as we walked on the <span class="DLF">Gelderskade</span> ...from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I lived the <span class="DLF">Nieuwe Hoogstraat</span> ...that is not far away from the <span class="DLF">Dam</span> ...as we walked on the <span class="DLF">Gelderskade</span> toward <span class="BUILDING">Centraal Station</span> , a man came over and and he saw my sister and my...we were both was together and he said, "Don't go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Don't go further, because they are trying to trick you; because over there is an "overvalle wagen" [a type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">emergency police vehicle</span> ], a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> , and the man who your parents probably gave money to, he is in cahoots with them." </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So we ran like crazy and I don't remember anything of my sister, anything, anything at all, but I remember I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I rang the bell and I fell in my father's arms and he cried so terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You...you know, that broke my heart because to see your father cry...so there I was again the next day back to the beauty par...to another <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> , had my hair done black, then back...went to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and, uh, maybe I wasn't ready with the course yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Maybe I hadn't taken my exam at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But by the end of '41 I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> because that is when the the Directrice asked us three, which I told already, to come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Another incident while I was there, so I didn't sleep at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore...my little brother who was then at the time eight and a half...he came to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and he walked through the <span class="DLF">barriers</span> because there were <span class="DLF">bridges</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with <span class="DLF">canals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">As most people know 1s <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and the Germans had a habit of raising the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , certainly when there was a razzia, and closing them off at eight o'clock because nobody was allowed after eight to be in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , so this little guy, when he...when he could, he tried to...being a young little boy, he wanted to show that he would get through and all of us, we would be scared to death and I scolded him, you know. "</span><span class="sentence" id="304">Don't do it!" </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And, "Why did you do it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And, "Don't you know what you are doing to Dad and Mom?" </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And then afterwards, shortly afterwards, he was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I often...oh, I often told myself, you know, why had I scolded him? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Why I...why did I do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="312">You know...memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  When was he taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  He was taken May 26th, 1943--with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">In '40...after '42, times were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Times were very intensive, and as I said I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and then the, uh, razzias started taking people from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , bringing in people from hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Everybody went to the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> as we Said before, and that is when the ordeal started with the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> where there were three transports during the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Now I don't recall exactly what evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">There was one Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">There was probably one Monday night, Tuesday or Wednesday...I don't recall the evenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That meant that the children who were given to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> to taken care...to be taken care of, to be loved by everyone, they went on transport, transport...those...during those nights, and that was terrible, the way it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">You see, the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> was meant for children of parents who worked during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They used to come there at eight o'clock, seven-thirty, between seven-thirty and eight o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The parents delivered them, mother usually, and then they got clean clothes and they got breakfast and we played with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">In the afternoon they got a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They rested. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were there till five, five-thirty I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">When the mother was through with work, she came and picked up the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Now an influx of new children came there, that were taken away from their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> was changed then. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It used to have...1magine a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...you enter...there's a big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Where you enter is a big <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Next <span class="DLF">door</span> , next to that big <span class="DLF">door</span> 1s a smaller <span class="DLF">door</span> with a smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">That is the place where the children were given to us in the morning by the parents when they went off to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The big <span class="DLF">doors</span> , they were usually not even opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Every...the whole traffic went through there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Now let's get back to the big <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">On the right hand side when you come in, there's a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">That's where the Directrice, Miss Pimentel lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The following <span class="DLF">door</span> on that <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> to the right is a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> for the personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">On the left hand side, there was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the babies used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Mothers had babies too, and the babies came there too during the day, so from any time after birth till they were about a year old, they were in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in the wicker baskets, in the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and they were very well taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Next to that <span class="INT_SPACE">baby room</span> , on the left-hand side, was a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">In my mind, huge then, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh, then when you go a little bit through the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , there was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but that was where the diapers were washed, because we didn't only take care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We also had to wash their clothes, at least their, the diapers and the the underwear, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It was a heck of a smell always (laughter), it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And we didn't look forward to have, to have "corvée," as it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">There was a big <span class="DLF">staircase</span> going upstairs, with a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">There was to the left, if I remember correctly, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a right <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span> must have been up front, a huge big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Uh, at the original time it was used for...we had baby little, little, yah, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> standing there, because the kids would sleep during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But now it was converted to a real <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cots</span> , little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , everything that could hold a child would stand there. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The big huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the up front, was then used for the age from about the time they were born 'til four or five, and the bigger children would be in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I had, uh, charge of children from zero till four or five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I was in charge of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The <span class="INT_SPACE">baby room</span> was moved upstairs because the <span class="INT_SPACE">baby room</span> now became an <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> where Mr. Suskind, who was working in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , who was in charge of all the registration of all people who came in there, so he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> ; and the Directrice converted [NB: conversed] with him--secretly always--in that <span class="INT_SPACE">baby room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Am I clear? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Yah? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Uh, by '42, not too many children came in but we knew we could count on many more because there were transports but not as regular yet as it would be by the end of '42, middle of '42, '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Then really the whole Jewish population was taken away, and they needed every...every centimeter of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> they had to put up the children and to put up the people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Uh, let me start a day during occupation, during razzias. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  Who came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  The...the Jewish people that were picked up in razzias. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">The <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">The Germans came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They combed every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They first with the big, uh, things... with the how do you call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I forgot...where you...where you can call through [megaphones]. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I forgot the name for that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Not in Dutch nor English I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Uh, they screamed in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for people have to come down and old people, young people, men, women, children...everybody had to get down in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">There would be big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They were beaten into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> ...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Uh, I saw that...I have seen personally that they threw older...an older neighbor of mine, all the way down from the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> because he didn't want to come down, and, uh, that was only once. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Then once I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , I wasn't in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Maybe lucky, I don't know, because the day my parents were taken away from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my brother and the whole family-May 26th, 1943--I was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I was there day and night. (</span><span class="sentence" id="383">Cough) So, uh, the children, the parents, they came in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , were pushed out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They were standing in front and then in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> and they were registered by people there from the Joodse Raad. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The Germans were there standing guard and they were just seeing to it that everything went correctly, that they were registered correctly by name, by number. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So what they tried to do there, they tried not to register children. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They tried if possible, if they could, they tried, uh, a family with four children...uh, mama, papa, child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  This is the Jewish Council, or the Joodse Raad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They would try, if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And that was mainly the intent of Mr. Walter Susskind, with some other people too, because nobody worked alone, nor in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> nor in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> nor in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It was all a combined effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">At...in the beginning, nobody knew what he was doing, just, uh, trying to save, uh, relative, an acquaintance, somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">But very soon it became a joint effort to try to save as many as you could in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So, as I said before, the people in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , they were crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Imagine...I don't know how big the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was...maybe two hundred people at the time...that would have been a big <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> I suppose at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Many hundreds were sent in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">No nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They were just sitting on very uncomfortable <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Uh, there must have been two, maybe three, maybe one...I don't know...toilets. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">How was that, uh, sixty, seventy years ago when they built the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Maybe there was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , so you can imagine what went on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And, uh, so the Germans decided, "All the children, out" And that's where the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We...after awhile, we--the three girls--got orders from our Directrice who was always in touch with this Mr. Susskind. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">She sent us to get the children from there and bring them to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Now we all had...the three of us were all in charge of a group, so we all had a number of girls working with us, and something I regret for the rest of my life is--and my husband knows because he became involved there, too--uh, I had a book with every name of every child, when it came in, who the parents were, when it was born, and when it left. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">On the last day of the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , we left--that's another story--and I couldn't take it with me because that was too dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  How did you avoid this entire time being deported yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Uh, there was no question of avoiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Since we were.... the Directrice was supposed to be there...
QUESTION:  Was she Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  She was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">She was necessary there. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The three of us were necessary there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The other girls that worked there were necessary there. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">However, I have here with me a picture of the Directrice with the, as was called, the "Onderdirectrice" [assistant director], the director. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">She was a non-Jewish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">She had to leave the <span class="REGION">premises</span> I believe already in the beginning of 1941 because she was non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So we were all Jewish there, and the Germans would say, "We have...we need some" ...through the Joodse Raad, I suppose...""We need so many people there, and this person, this person, this person...they are necessary because you can't leave those children alone," so there was no doubt for me that I would stay on. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So was the Directrice. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So were the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now we discussed once in a while, what if something, ...heh? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But we dismissed it from our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We were busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">We were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">We didn't think the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We...it it ...now I can honestly say that the big tragedy didn't even penetrate at the time because the people went out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Who could imagine what was intended for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Who could imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So, uh, we just hoped that everybody would come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Now this entire time, what did you know of your family, your parents and...
ANSWER:  My parents were....
QUESTION:  Your sister and brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  My, my sister was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I didn't know anything about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">My parents were taken away on the 26th of May with my brother...
QUESTION:  In 194....3?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Three...and I saw them because I saw them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> as they...as they drove...they were not even in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">They went directly to the <span class="DLF">Poldeweg</span> or where ever <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ... whatever <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They were going straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  How did you find out that they had been taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Because, uh, we found out the same day because other people were brought in and I don't know where the choice was made...this one goes through and that one doesn't go through and this one goes in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">My parents never made it to the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They went through, and uh...yeah that was known so fast because that is such an operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">All the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> go up. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Nobody comes through. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Not a gentile, not a Jew, nothing, nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So that was known, I think, the same half hour that it started, and messages someway always slip through, come through, and in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> they must have known, because they must have been told by the Germans that they could expect many children, many people, many everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You asked me something I really, uh, never thought of, but we knew what we kew. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">We knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">My luck, call it luck...was that I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">If I would have been <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I would have had the same fate as all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But, uh, the children came, kept on coming and by that time there were some organizations going without my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I mean the underground, the, the, uh, the VN that operated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brabant</span> and there was an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> and there was an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , but unknown to us, because we occupied ourselves only with the children...get them ready, get them from the parents, keep them quiet, play with them, dress them, get them ready for transport, because three times at nig...during the week, the transport would leave at ten o'clock at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">That meant that we knew in the morning already that kids would have to be delivered to the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Now which kids? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Sometimes it was a lucky one, the one who was not registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">There were very few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Those children were hidden within the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and my husband can tell his story better than I do, but he stayed with the children that were hidden upstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That those were mostly bigger boys because how could you do it with very young ones, you know, so they must have been so in the age from eight or twelve, thirteen, fourteen...I don't know exactly anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">They were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They were either on a walk or, uh, over the <span class="DLF">hedge</span> ...over the edge from...over the...over the...yeah...over the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I have never seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I haven't even ever known it, because everybody did their own bit secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Nobody told anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Nobody...you didn't tell your best friend, whatever, because it was just too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Not too dangerous...you didn't realize it was dangerous for you, but it was dangerous for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">If you would say, "This kid is not registered," then it goes out, then that couldn't be told; and I don't even think anybody knew that that child wasn't registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">That was something absolutely between something absolutely between Mr. Siskind in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> and the Directrice in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Uh, to take the children to transport was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They were all little. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">As if they felt, you had to wake them up at nine o'clock to have them ready by ten, and, uh, to get them dressed as if...and as if they felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I don't remember anybody cried, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">As...there was such a terrible atmosphere, such fear of not knowing what is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Nobody knew they were going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">You, you, you knew...you didn't know whether they stayed with the parents, maybe in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , maybe...there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> , even in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> you didn't know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Uh, there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> ...they called "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> " later, when you heard the word "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We didn't know, and that is the tragedy of it all because the people didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Maybe...maybe the Dutch population would have done more if they would have known, but they were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They were not helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They, uh...there were some...I would say maybe five percent...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">According to my knowledge, what I saw in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , in my...of the people that were saved through others, maybe...maybe a very, very small percentage of the people did something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Did you know what was going to happen to the children after they were transported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">That's what I just explained. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">How could you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="486">How? </span><span class="sentence" id="487">How could you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They went to...with their parents to to work <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Now a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , that was something not pleasant but you had to work there, maybe in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , maybe make I don't know what; but the children went with the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Now we were told, the three of us were told an org..., underground organizations were set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">An underground organization, people--individual people--they they would contact people...not that I knew it at the time but they would contact people in, say, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friesland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> , in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; and they would ask, ask people, "Would you have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a little Jewish girl or a little Jewish boy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="492">This one would be able to have one if it would have blue eyes and blond hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The other one needed a four-year-old with dark hair and blond eyes...uh, uh, blond hair and dark eyes, so it would fit in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Those messages came through, through the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Even so, it sounds incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Finally through Suskind who was, of course, completely underground-minded with all he did with the Joodse Raad. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">He got the message back to the Directrice; so when we had children that fitted that image, that child would be kept away. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">That child...but you couldn't keep a child away from the parents without the parents giving consent to give it away, so the three of us, we were sent to the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> with the message to the parents as follows. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">In your own words: "Look, we don't know what is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We don't know where you are going to be, under what circumstances you will have to live with your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Would you mind if we tried to find a family, a foster family, for your child, which will keep it until you come back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You can imagine the questions would follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The mother: "For how long?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="504">How long? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Nobody can tell you." "</span><span class="sentence" id="506">Where?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="507">T...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Sorry, I don't know." "</span><span class="sentence" id="509">To whom are you going to give it?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="510">Yah, to somebody who will take care of your child." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So you speak in, in, in kind of a veil...in kind of.... How would you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Uh, in, in a language that people don't understand, the people cannot trust it. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They trust me probably, so few gave up their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Too few, because of...you want to keep your child with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">If I would have the choice today, I would say, "I keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I keep my child with me;" because those we are talking about...children from from year old to five years old, six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So the few people that gave up their children...there were not so many I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Those children we kept in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> when the other children went on transport, but we came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> ...Family A has four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The Family B has three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Everybody was accounted...had to be accounted for, so now came the family who had given up a child to go in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We didn't use the word underground with those people because that word didn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Hiding didn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">No, they would be foster children to someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So at night when we came to be counted for, what we did...we took instead of the children, of instead of that particular child that they had consented to go in hiding, we we had a little blanket, blanket with a little piece of rag in there or a doll or whatever looked like a, a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">If the child would be bigger, a little bit bigger, we would really have something big there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">It was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It was really scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But you didn't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It was just in the way of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">You did it uh and you hoped only that the parents wouldn't allow anybody to look at the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Oh, God forbid! </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I still, I still get the creeps when I think of it; that the German would say, "Let me see the child." </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Which never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  We're in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  We're in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Uh, there are several razzias. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">There are many razzias, small ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">People are being picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Uh, uh, I skipped the February razzia in 1942, but, uh, that was a different story...political, where the Dutch really went out; and they... there were strikes, <span class="DLF">railway</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> , etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="541">public transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But in '43, in, on the 26th of May, there was this tremendous big razzia where they took everybody out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , closed off the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ; and (coughs) at that time they picked up as many as as three thousand people at a time, and that was the reason I recall now that my parents did not enter the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , that they had because at that time they didn't separate anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They didn't bring anybody down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They went straight to the...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Now in June 1943 there was another razzia; and, well, this time...I think it was the 20th of June, uh, another razzia took place where they took a tremendous big amount of people, whereby my husband's family who had moved...who had lived originally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> ...they were obliged to mo...to move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as Jews, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and now um in June the 20th, June the 20th, they were picked up in a razzia and taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and from there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">That was first my family...now Harry's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Uh, at this time the Directrice, liked Harry, liked me; because Harry was...when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , got also a job, uh--but he will tell his story himself--and, uh, she decided we should get married before anything should happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Uh...we got married on June the 28th, 1943, in the morning at twelve o'clock; whereby Harry came to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and called out to me, "Sieny, uh, give over to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Take care that you are ready by twelve because we are getting married." </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And at that time we got married in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was supposed to be the Joodse Gemeente, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , but it didn't exist anymore and it was just a formality, and, uh, there came a few people from <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> in long...in a long coats and I had just gotten a clean uniform from somebody, a nurse's uniform because, uh, you know, after all getting married is not such a...you don't get married in a dirty uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So that took care of our marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">The Directrice was witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">When we came back to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , she had cookies and then some chocolates which she had kept for a special occasion, you know, and this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Shortly afterwards...1t must have been July, Harry moved in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> then, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We all had little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , the three girls and uh, now uh, I don't know the date anymore but it must have been the beginning of July, there was another razzia. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I couldn't tell you the date anymore exactly...by which the whole <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">They took all the children, all the personnel help including the Directrice and me, and, uh, we all went on transport; so we all went to what was called then the <span class="DLF">Poldeweg</span> -- which was I suppose a railroad plaats, placement, placement, where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> turned around, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">etc.--from where all the razzias, people that were taken in the razzias, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We were lying there during the night and, uh, the hos...<span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Then all the <span class="BUILDING">people's homes</span> , whoever was a Jew was brought there. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And, uh, suddenly they called out, "Mrs. Cohen from <span class="BUILDING">Das Kinderhaus</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So, we had with us Virrie Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">She was the daughter of Professor Cohen, the head of the Jewish Council, Joodse Raad;

"</span><span class="sentence" id="565">Das freche Weib." </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Now they had...one of the Germans--Von Klingebiel--who was a guard at the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , he called me "Das freche Weib" [meaning "the impudent or cheeky woman" in German] because I dared to stand up to the Germans at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  That translates to...
ANSWER:  That translates to a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where children are asleep, a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> , and suddenly twenty Germans come in with their boots stamping and screaming and shouting; and there am I, and I call out, "Get out of here! </span><span class="sentence" id="568">How dare you to come in here! </span><span class="sentence" id="569">How dare you to disturb children that are asleep! </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I don't want to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Get out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And with that they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Unbelievable as it sounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Incredible, but it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And from that time on, to the Germans I was "Das freche Weib." </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They called me... they called me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">One day I was called to the...because once in a while you gave up your...you gave up your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> because one of the other girls had family in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , and they wanted to see them for the last time. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">For the time being they didn't know, but for the last time, their family or their friends, so we exchanged the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and she went, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So one day I was called and I was said, "You go on transport," and I said, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And I...and they said, "Because you have a nerve giving your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">You are supposed to come here and you gave it.... You go on transport." </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So I said, "So send me. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">My parents are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You took my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I go to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I go." </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Whereupon he gave me back my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and told me to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don't want to use the word, but to get out fast, go back to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So that's my story about "Das freche Weib"; and when I was at the <span class="DLF">Poldeweg</span> we didn't, between three thousand people, and they called off my name, then Virrie Cohen went because after all she was the daughter of Professor Cohen, and then they needed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They put me in a in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with all Germans around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I think I was stiff with fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I, I think I couldn't move a finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And they drove off, changed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , put me in another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and dropped me in front of the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> in the middle of the night, not a single person in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , anybody, nobody; and I came back to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , and Mr. Siskind and all the others were standing, not outside the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> but in the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> within the glass, without...within the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">When they saw me, they couldn't believe their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And the Germans gave them order, "From now on she is in charge here in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But then I was nineteen, and the daughter of Professor Cohen came back the next day and she was something like twenty-five, twenty-six and she was a registered nurse; so it was the logical thing that she would be in charge and she became in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> then 'til the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I think it was the 29th of September...
QUESTION:  1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  1943...when the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> was emptied. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">If the date is not hundred percent correct...the 29th...was the end of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And, uh, at that time, that morning, Harry came over and said, "Sieny, get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We are leaving." </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And I said, "I cannot leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">How can I leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We still have children here." </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Not many...there were not many, anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He said, "You have to, because I heard and I feel it is over." </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So we discussed it with a few other girls and they said, "You have to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Also Virrie said, "Go." </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So we went, and as we went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> past the <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , the Germans stopped us and Harry had a false identity card because we all had passports with a J on it, but he had gotten from the underground organization there in the same <span class="BUILDING">Schouwburg</span> , he had gotten false identification cards for him and for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And as we walked there and we were stopped and the German said, "Show me your papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I dropped dead almost because I thought he gave the wrong papers, but he gave the right papers without the J, so he said go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And we walked, and we walked all the way to the <span class="DLF">Amsterkade</span> , which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , the southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We didn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We didn't...we didn't dare to sigh. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We didn't...we wanted to keep as silent as...and we walked over there and when we came near that <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , I will never forget...1t is a round <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on that corner...we stood there and we took off our stars which had been fastened...we had loosened already before...and we took out, off the stars and we went quickly upstairs to the woman who had an address for us to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We came up there and shortly afterwards came a man, "Uncle Hannis." </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And this is really the story...the end of my story from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I couldn't take a...I couldn't bring along the book with all the names, with all the children, because that would have endangered everybody uh to show them the children, those children have gone on transport and those children are in hiding, so I had to leave it there, not realizing that it wouldn't be there after we came back because we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">After I came back there was no <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So, uh, that was the end of the most important time in my life for ever and ever to be; and then comes the hiding story which is a story unbelievable, too...
QUESTION:  Before we go into that, Sieny, when you were at the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , about how many children were saved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  Well, I always...I always... PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - TAPE CHANGE TAPE #3
QUESTION:  About how many children were saved from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Uh, you ask me a question which is very difficult to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I know I have seen in in in different articles the amount of thousand children. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The number of thousand children, to me, seems almost not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I have always thought from the start when we talked about it while we were in hiding, that the number of children saved from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , actually from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , would have been around three hundred, because it was so difficult; but then I don't know what else played without my knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Uh, to me it always seemed a reasonable number, three hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I've talked about it with some other people too, who thought so.... But, yah...I, I don't dare to say thousand is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">A thousand maybe would be possible if you calculate the children that were picked up in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and were not taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> , but were were taken immediately to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> or wherever; but a thousand children...it seems an awful lot to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  You had mentioned something before about going... TECHNICAL DISRUPTION
QUESTION:  You had mentioned before, before you went into hiding, that your husband had given false papers to a German on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but if you were wearing a yellow star, how is it you were able to pass?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Yah...no. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Of course he gave them the correct passport with the J, but I I was scared to death that he would pull out the, the uh...yah...how would you call it...the imitation passport without the J, which to me was as I am telling the story, that was the good one, you know, so my mind skipped and I made from the imitation the good one, while at that time the correct one was the one with the J on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So I was scared that he had given the one without the J on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  But the Germans still let you pass?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">When he saw that the passport had a J on it, for Jew, he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">He said, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And Harry said, "Oh, we are just...we belong...we...we're going back to the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We were just going for a little stroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We just walk around here and we go back." "</span><span class="sentence" id="645">OK," he said; but of course we never came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  So now it's late 1943 and you've gone into hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Hiding just starts as we enter the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of one Mrs. de Swaan,’ who was a a fantastic woman * Truus de Swaan was a woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> who collaborated with Boogard family to help find <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">who saved many many children; and, uh, as we came to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we had sent there some clothes in a valise and we heard immediately the valise was stolen because there was broken into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we were without clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Uh, a few hours later came the man to pick me up, one of us up, to take to, uh, to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we would...where I would be for the time being until Harry could join me, and then he would take us to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we would stay, so, uh, there was no time for clothes, for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I went with this man and he took me to a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They had...they had nine children of their own and had just lost a child and wanted to take a Jewish child that just fit in the range of their children with the same color eyes and the same color hair at the age in between their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">That was a wonderful family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  And where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  That was in (cough)...yah...the family name was | Ablossedam (ph)], and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">No, Harry? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Yeah. [</span><span class="sentence" id="659">Wiewerdam (ph)]| was their name. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So I stayed there one day, and at night Harry came with the same man who had taken me there and now the man picked up Harry later because it was too dangerous to take up...to pick up two people at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So he said, "I'm going to take you to your address where you will stay for the time being until the occupation is over." </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So he took us, and we--it was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , I believe--and we drove through part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> --uh <span class="DLF">pasture</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , beautiful <span class="DLF">pasture</span> , beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , what you don't see...everything you don't see in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> --and we felt...oh, we could breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">As if a brick fell from our heart and our shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">We were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We stopped for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Imagine a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ...half of the...half on the on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> ...a little bit over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">home boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">houseboat</span> , it is called...a houseboat. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">This man held goats. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Oh, what a smell! </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It was...the smell was was horrendous, but we didn't mind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">It felt...we felt, we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">As we entered that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the man said...the owner from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , said to "Uncle Hannis," the man who took us there, "What do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="673">To bring me Jews again? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I just had a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">You...I cannot take them." </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Oh my gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">There was...there was the brick again, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We felt terrible. "</span><span class="sentence" id="679">Uncle Hannis" said, "But you have to take them, even if it is only for tonight because I cannot take them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">It is too dangerous." </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We came in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">There's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ...the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> where where where he has his, uh, steering equipment and behind there a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , big flowers, gladiolas on both sides, <span class="DLF">windows</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">As he explained to us the flowers were there to protect the people either from the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> or the side of the <span class="REGION">land</span> to look into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , because there were no curtains. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So, uh, he said "Now, make yourself at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Here is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I'll give you...I'll bring you some sheets and uh there is no danger here, but be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I have a little dog and if the dog barks, there's danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Then quickly open this <span class="DLF">window</span> on the water...on the water-side and jumped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , 1n the <span class="DLF">canal</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So we were stiff with cold and fear again, and we put our clothes close behind us and we lie down on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Who dares to undress, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And behold, the little dog started to bark, and we jump out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , in the <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Don't ask me, "Now, how or or what or how did you come back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I don't even remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I remember that afterwards he went around with a...with a...with a flashlight and he said, "Tis nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Everything is OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">He must have smelled a rat or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So I don't know how we got back, but, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Next morning...next morning: "Uh, are you dry?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="701">Yes, we are dry." </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He said, "I'm getting water." </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Now, this is the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It shouldn't be told because it is a horrible, terrible (laughter), dirty story; but listen...those people lived still in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> without gas, without electricity, without water, so what did they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They had a big pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They call it here in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> a kroes [a pot used for drinking | pot, blue Delft pot or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">During the night this pot was used for all of us, to do you know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">In the morning we took this pot, held it over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , did like this in the <span class="DLF">canal</span> , emptied it out, took his little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> , went with this pot across the <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">There was a pump on the other side of the <span class="DLF">canal</span> , and he pumped water and that was our drinking water and our that we had to cook with and to do with, and we cooked with the water out of the <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Well, it couldn't have been worse if you'd just come out of civilization, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Those people never washed themselves, uh...selves and they were used to this kind of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But we were not, so not only did we have to look out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> that nobody was coming...it became a danger to stay there; so in the evening we had to take that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> and row to a little isle in the <span class="DLF">canal</span> where somebody had hidden some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> ...what you called then a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">A little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">speedboat</span> or God knows what it was...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So we sat...we went in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">canoe</span> , __ it wasn't, and we hurried with paddles, went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , and we heard plump, plump, plump, plump...and we thought, "My God...the Germans, you know...they are after us," because it was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We had to go there in dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Nobody was allowed to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So when we came within the shelter of the of the...
