<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  My name is Eli Rock, spelled E-l-i and R-o-c-k. I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on August 12th, 1915. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My parents were Russian Jews, who had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> around the turn of the century and I had an older sister who was born in 1913 and a younger brother, who lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My sister died some time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And my parents set up a -a-- when they initially came, they worked in <span class="BUILDING">clothing shops</span> and whatnot, but they -- in the early 20’s, opened a <span class="BUILDING">dry goods store</span> in the Italian section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> and we lived over the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , initially. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Jefferson Junior High School and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">East High School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> and -- and my freshman year at Jefferson Junior High School, I met a lifelong friend named Joe Platt. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We discovered we had the same birthday and that’s what made us close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He was later the president of <span class="BUILDING">Harvey Mudd College</span> and another <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and I hope to see him, before too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I grew up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , where I formed some good friendships and they were -- these were first generation immigrants and some of them were fairly tough kids, but some weren’t and when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">East High School</span> , we went -- I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And by then my parents had moved away from <span class="DLF">State Street</span> and work -- were living in another section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I lived at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and when I graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span> in 1937, I first went to <span class="BUILDING">Michigan Law School</span> for one year and then transferred to <span class="BUILDING">Yale Law School</span> , from which I graduated in 1940 and I was interested in labor relations, I had been a member of the Teamsters Union while I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , driving, quote, an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ice truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">In those days they still had ice and the football players all had pictures in summertime carrying blocks of ice on their shoulder and I fancied myself doing that and I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But it paid well, that was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I even wrote a history of that local union for a class I had in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But anyway, I went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and I got out in 1940 and practiced law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I guess I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> for a number of years and then in ‘42, went to work for the War Labor Board in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and they transferred me eventually, to the Philadelphia Regional War Labor Board, which is how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And then in 1947, I went overseas to drive an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> in the French army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Didn’t you go there before 1947?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Yeah, I left in ‘47.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  You left the Labor Board in ‘47?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  No, didn’t you go to Europe in ‘45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I guess you’re right. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I went to work for the War Labor Board, come to think of it, in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and then they sent me to the Philadelphia Regional War Labor Board and I left in late “44, is that what I mentioned earlier? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I -- I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> for a couple of years and I -- I wanted to get into the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  I was a 4-F, but I -- I was born with a -- a -- a heart abnormality, which disqualified me for military service, but I still felt it was an event I wanted to observe first hand and I heard about the American field service, which sent ambulance drivers, as it had done in World War One, to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and to the first French army, which was then not yet back actually into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But I -- I drove an ambulac-ambulance for the American field service in the first French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And when the war ended, I stayed on in Europe and went to work for the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Okay, let me ask you just a little bit more about your sort of family life, your religious background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, my parents were typically of their generation of immigrants, not terribly observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My grandparents were very observant, they -- both, on both sides had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and we observed all of the important holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My mother had two sets of dishes and another two sets for Passover, that’s four sets of dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we -- I used to -- she used to send me over to the showthefab near the Jewish section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> to get kosher meat and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">She was -- she wouldn’t have thought of not having kosher meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And actually I studied, my initial Hebrew, Jewish lessons were with my maternal grandfather at his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And then to prepare for my Bar Mitzvah, I went to more formal <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> run by a revel -- Rabbi Solomon, which we used to call Rabbi Solomon’s slaughterhouse because he had a strap, a big strap if the kids didn’t pay attention and -- Rabbi Not’s slaughter academy or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I got Bar Mitzvahed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> and I was observant for a brief period. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I did the fillinin for about three months and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">After graduating from <span class="BUILDING">East High School</span> , I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span> in 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Did you -- and so you -- you did certainly identify with being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Oh sure, I mean all of the holidays and even though we grew up in this non-Jewish neighborhood, I [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  And so you had non-Jewish friends as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Did you -- can you remember, sort of any -- sort of quality, any values that were instilled about your family life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  In all honesty, I -- I mean it’s -- I don’t think I resented the inconveniences of being Jewish at that time, having to walk across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all the time to get kosher meat and the -- but I -- I certainly observed the dietary laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I just didn’t eat at anybody else’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I -- and except for this close friend that I’ve been friends with from -- Joe Platt and I met as friends in the seventh grade, in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We went all through <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">college</span> together, the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But whenever -- when -- when I went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a meal, which was the first time I ever ate anywhere else, his mother was very careful to give me -- give us a dairy meal, dairy foods, she just -- she realized I could not eat traifa food. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But -- yeah, I had good friends, like Joe Platt, primarily Joe Platt and then I formed -- I did not join the Jewish fraternity at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And -- and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , first to <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> for one year, <span class="BUILDING">Michigan Law School</span> in ‘37, ‘38 and then to <span class="BUILDING">Yale Law School</span> , [indecipherable] graduated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  What -- did you have any -- were there any sort of cultural groups, any Zion-Zionist groups, anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  I think I used, at one point, I belonged to some sort of a Jewish group, a -- the -- again it was in another section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Priorly, I -- I had very ex -- in th -- in those early days, very few Jewish friends and my closest friend was Joe Platt and the -- I guess a couple of the Italian, we grew -- this was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian neighborhood</span> and I guess I did have -- Frankie Deponzio was a pretty good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We li-lived -- our <span class="BUILDING">dry goods store</span> was next to the Deponzo’s -- Deponzio’s grocery store on <span class="DLF">State Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I don’t think I had any -- we - we observed all of the holidays but I don’t think I had any intent to get into Jewish affairs, it just worked out that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  I guess what I’m trying to get a sense of, was there something about your family life, certain values you grew up with that in some way prepared you or motivated you later on to do the sort of work you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Oh, that’s hard to -- that’s hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was a liberal, politically, I just seemed to be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I guess I identified with underdogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I certainly felt that I was a minority and maybe that’s what enabled me to identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But I think I got into labor relations work because they were do-gooders. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I joined it -- I belonged to this union when I peddled ice and I wrote the term paper, something about that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I identified and my parents were both members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I knew the head of the Amalgamated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , in fact he was a close friend of my family’s and so I -- I -- I had, somehow this moving in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Socially motivated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">By family and associations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You -- you were starting to say that you wanted to -- to be part of the war effort, you couldn’t go as a soldier, so I think you heard about the American Field Service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Okay, in the fall of ‘44, I signed up to be an ambulance driver with the field service and they sent me to Europe and I became -- I became part of a -- a medical unit that was working with the first French army, which was the first French effort after their defeat by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to mount a military effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I drove an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> for the first French army in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And had some interesting experiences and when the war ended, I joined the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Well, tell me a little -- you’re saying you had some interesting experiences --
ANSWER:  But because --
QUESTION:  I want to hear about those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  With the French army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Yeah, with the Field Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  The -- I was reviewing some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The -- in -- there was a -- things were chaotic after the war, in the immediate, th-that is after the armistice and everything was disorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The armistice was in May, *45. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">May 12th, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And we were stranded in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when the war ended and we drove back and the amusing experience was everything was chaotic, but here we were in uniforms, a motley kind of group and we -- we came by this great, big <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badenbaden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I guess it was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hotel Badenbaden</span> and we went up to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and there was a -- the manager or director was still there -- 1t was empty, the Germans had fled and the French had not yet occupied it and we -- this group of -- of 10 or so ambulance drivers said, “We are requisitioning the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And this man nodded his head, “Will you come in?” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And he treated us like -- muddy, with our duffel bags and whatnot, he ushered us to each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where the rugs were about six inches thick and you had these glittering chandeliers and we spent a few days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It was a memorable experience coming after the living cond -- well, we didn’t live badly as ambulance drivers, but -- wi-with local families. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And -- and then I -- I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and initi -- I didn’t want to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet, I had -- I didn’t know when I'd get back to Europe and this was a chance to see Europe and I -- J at first tried to get a job with UNRA and friends of mine, Ben and Marnie Shaufler were in Europe with <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> and they -- Marnie was there and Ben, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Marnie worked for <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> and UNRA would not hire me, they just didn’t under -- they didn’t hire people in -- in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And -- but they -- Marnie and Ben knew about the JDC, they had done some work for the JDC and they sent me around to the <span class="BUILDING">JDC Paris office</span> , where I met Greenleigh, Arthur Greenleigh, G-r-e-e-n-l-e-1-g-h, who was running the program of the Joint in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They had not yet brought over any people. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They hadn’t been able to -- or supplies, but they were doing whatever they could and here was an American who could at least be a body in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Initially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then I sent myself into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the summer of ‘45, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> which wa -- became the -- initially it was a -- a mixture of Jewish and non- Jewish displaced persons, but it became all Jewish and I was stationed there for the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  We’re jumping ahead a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I want -- I want to ask you a couple questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Just quickly back to the AFS. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Were you -- when you were driving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> , were you able to observe anything about what was going on in the war, or about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Really only once. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We met a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivor on a <span class="DLF">road</span> , he had wandered off by himself and his head was shaven and -- this is while I’m driving an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , before I’ve gone to work for the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I think he’d -- I’m not sure whether he was still wearing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> pajamas, but then we -- when I went to work for the JDC, of course, that was in the early days after the war and that was -- those first -- those six months between May -- if that’s when I went to work for the JDC, in -- no, we said I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">In July of ‘45, I went back int-into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and worked at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> until - which was this first Jewish all DP camp, until December, ‘45 and there -- there were some very, very emotional experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">People did not know, initially, that their families had been decimated. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">People who could work were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Nobody knew yet about the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> or even the full extent of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I remember one man in particular who had just learned about what had happened to his family and I was there in this JDC uniform, which was like a military uniform and I was good, strong physical condition and I remember his walking up to me, with tears, he had just learned apparently, about what had happened to his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And he said to me in Yiddish, “Dusha svair itsa zine a Yid.” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It is hard to be a Jew and -- with tears flowing down his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That was -- I met, I’m sure -- I mean, stationed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , I met a lot of people, but in those early days, when it was just being learned by these people who had been separated, that they -- their families had been liquidated, that became a very emotional kind of period to work -- to be working with those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  How much did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  I don’t think I knew much. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I mean, I had driven the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and I’d met this one guy, who -- who mentioned something about what had happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and people began their -- come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we learned from some of them, what had been happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The awareness of what had been done by the Germans to the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , did not take place until sometime after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There just wasn’t the communication, there wasn’t the information and -- course the average German said he didn’t know, she didn’t know about it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But there were relatives who must have come back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> who must have told them what Hitler was doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  I’m going to stop the tape here, because we need to change the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  As much -- you know, I -- I’m stopping you because there’s much o-of this sort of personal detail, you think it’s really helpful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Well I -- I’ve been... End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Okay, we were starting to talk a little bit about your work with the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I have a couple questions I’d like to throw out and then sort of let you --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  -- tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The first is, what your primary responsibilities were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">What, you know, what kind of work you were involved in, cause I know they -- they were trying to accomplish a lot and also what -- what credentials you had or what experience you had for the kind of work that you would be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Well my only credentials were that A -- I knew something about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because I’d been driving an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> there and we would be sending people in to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and the JDC initially had nobody in parts -- those parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or even in the northern -- the British occupied parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So I -- I certainly could be helpful in the red tape of getting somebody into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and -- and then we had dealings with the French-Jewish community and I had fairly good command of French, I had had a lot of French in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I -- when I drove an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> for the first French army, we spoke a lot of French, so that was kind of -- but I think mainly there was nobody else for them to hire and they desperately needed people for whatever programs they could organize.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  And then sort of let you --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The first 1s, what your primary responsibilities were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">What -- you know, what kind of work you were involved in, cause I know they -- they were trying to accomplish a lot and also what -- what credentials you had or what experience you had for the kind of work that you would be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Well my only credentials were that A -- I knew something about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because I’d been driving an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> there and we would be sending people in to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and the JDC initially had nobody in parts -- those parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or even in the northern -- the <span class="REGION">British occupied parts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I -- I certainly could be helpful in the red tape of getting somebody into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and -- and then we had dealings with the French-Jewish community and I had fairly good command of French, I had had a lot of French in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I -- when I drove an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> for the first French army, we spoke a lot of French, so that was kind of -- but I think mainly there was nobody else for them to hire and they desperately needed people for whatever programs they could organize.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  And so what --
ANSWER:  And so I was there as Arthur Greenleigh’s assistant and I think what we did, basically, was to prepare people or -- for -- prepare for sending people into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And dealing with the French-Jewish community or it’s representatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and maintaining contact with the JDC in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> and Greenleigh held down the <span class="BUILDING">Paris office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Schwartz was in charge of everything in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He had been there before the armistice, he had been in -- I think on some missions in <span class="REGION">occupied Hungary</span> and -- and the JDC had a representative in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , Solly -- that fabled Solly Meir, who was able to send supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I-In fact, I once organized a convoy of -- of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The army gave us, I don’t know, 10 or 15 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , where the JDC, through Solly Meir had a big supply of food packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Packetten. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And we -- we took a whole truckload. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I think maybe more than one truckload back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , where they were eagerly distributed by the Jewish committee there and this was something the JDC could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">UNRA provided all of the basic supplies, we never had the -- the facility for -- we never -- we were always a supplementary organization, there was -- oh, they had a phra -- a word for people like us and the Quakers, who were not UNRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="153"><span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> was the official relief organization and we were -- whatever we -- we were called, we supplemented the work of <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  When you said that you were sending people into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or you were working with the French-Jewish community, what does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">What -- what for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Well, we wanted staff in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The JDC did not have any staff in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we were the representatives of -- we were the overseas relief organization for the American Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And in this unprecedented catastrophe, it was certainly important for the American Jewish committee -- c-community, to have representatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , for observation, for suppla -- for relief work and even though it could not bring -- it could not- there was not the transportation available to bring over supplies from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , to help feed and so forth, we -- we could do immigration counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We -- we had a -- a -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> a really wonderful s -- I forgot what we called it, a search organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A Lithuanian -- young Lithuanian Jew named Larry Lebetsky, whose family had survived the Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , through the help of -- actually I think 1t was a German military friend whom they had come to know during the German occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lith-Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Larry Lebetsky became one of our staff people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I guess, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And he set up a <span class="BUILDING">tracing bureau</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , because people needed to find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They needed to contact their relatives and the -- they didn’t know yet who was alive and who wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And one really emotional experience occurred when somebody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> or somebody in -- if there was a camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , came to our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- I’m not sure whether this happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I think probably it happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Somebody came into our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day and said, “Would you help me find my relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I had relatives and I haven’t been in touch with them for a long time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And he left us his name and it was -- we didn’t get the first name, it was Cohen or Hymen or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And our <span class="BUILDING">tracing office</span> , run by Larry Lebetsky, this survivor, found a relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> I think, who -- these were relatives of course, who were delighted to find that this Herman Cohen had survived and the -- but we didn’t have his full name, we just had Cohen, I think and we -- Larry put up a notice in the DP camp, on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> bulletin board, saying, “So and so, will you come into our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , we have located your relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And after awhile a person came in and said, “This is my name and I have relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and I’m delighted that you -- you -- you’ve -- you know them, but how did you know I was looking for them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And we said, “Somebody with your name was just here a month ago.” </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He said, “That must be my brother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That other person had already left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and was wandering around <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to find -- try to find his relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And oh -- but at least they knew, he -- he knew that one member of his sur -- family had survived and they would then wander around <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in those days, where there was terrible -- lack -- no communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Telephones, whatnot were not working -- to try to find his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Eventually they would find each other, maybe in what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  How did this <span class="BUILDING">tracing bureau</span> work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, Larry would correspond with -- whether he worked with the <span class="BUILDING">UNRA tracing bureau</span> or directly with the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But he would get names, I think primarily of people who -- who came in and -- and said they heard there was a <span class="BUILDING">tracing bureau</span> or maybe we had a branch in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and said, “Would you help me, I don’t have the -- the address, I have a relative, my mother spoke of a relative who had migrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , but I don’t know anything more about that, I don’t know where he lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I don’t have his address, but I would like to make contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I would like to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and he could help me and -- or the family could help me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And so we tried to -- so -- and we had facilities in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But sometimes, with no more than a name, we would try to find somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and -- and sometimes we were successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I’ve forgotten what facilities there might have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I suppose we used the local United Jewish Appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I’ve forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Anyway, then we -- Larry Lebetsky got word back, 1n -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , that there was a relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And he posted this on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin board</span> , saying, “Mr. blank Cohen, of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , please come in, we have found your relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And then a couple of days later, somebody comes in and says, “My name is Cohen, but how did you know about my relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And we said, “Somebody was just here two days ago and he’s asking us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And that’s -- was his first knowledge that he -- that brother had survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  What about -- do -- did these tracing efforts also attempt to find surviving family members in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  In those early days, everybody was doing it on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">People would come back to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there was no public transportation and they would often walk and thumb rides and whatnot from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to try to find their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And then they would find that there was nobody left there and -- and they turned around and came back into <span class="REGION">occupied Germany</span> , where there were American organizations that could help them go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or to the States, to find relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I mean there was a s -- quite a lot of that by the survivors, trying to find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And Larry Lebetsky ran this <span class="BUILDING">tracing bureau</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to try to contact people together. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">How he did it, the details of it, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But he -- he was competent and I’m sure we -- we did a lot of that successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  The general work of the Joint, is there any way to describe that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  Your -- and most importantly, your work with it, not others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  As I said, we could not have brought in supplies, so all we could do was help out with things like uniting families, helping people to migrate, getting them visas to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and we had people in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> that we could contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We also tried to furnish some social amenities. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">For example, we decided one day -- there was a c-central -- there was a c -- there were committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You’d put a bunch of Jews in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you’ve got UNRA and whatnot, but you’re soon going to have a Jewish committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And there was a central committee of -- of surviving Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The head of which was a Dr. Chaim Greenberg, he was actually a medical doctor and oh, there’s a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> that became a -- a place for surviving Jewish DP’s, where he was and that was a -- a big function and to the extent that we could bring in supplies to supplement what was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The JDC brought in a -- a -- a lot of supplies, I think from the <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span> in those early days, when it was important to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we had packages -- we- from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , 1t became an advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Under the Nazis, you didn’t want to proclaim your Jewishness, if you were living as a Jew -- living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> instead of having been deported, you had been hiding or whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And y-you -- you had people who were 50 percent Jewish, 25 percent Jewish, who’d been in hiding, or they didn’t have food cards because they didn’t want to proclaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So they -- life would have been sort of difficult for them and these packages, but there became a question of how did you identify yourself, how could you claim you were a b -- you were a Jew, if -- because everybody now wanted to -- the irony of ironies, everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> now wanted to -- if they were even an eighth Jewish, they -- they proclaimed it and they -- they wanted to get these -- and we had the phrase, “Packett Yim.” </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Package Jews, [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They -- and it was understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">What got me off on that? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">What could the JDC do? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Well, we -- we could supplement and we could help with migration. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We could help with tracing, Larry Lebetsky did that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  Well, let’s talk about some of these specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The emigration, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Was that fairly easy to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  I think we had some difficulties with migrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There -- there was a quota system and it just wasn’t easy to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . ’</span><span class="sentence" id="224">ve forgotten what the limitations were, but the certain number from each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and it -- it wasn’t just Jews who were migrating and who wanted to migrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I -- I don’t know how successful we were in those early days in getting the people into the States. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And that became one of the reasons we started to get people to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We had some sort of -- of a -- tra -- truck transportation system for taking people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , from which they could then go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And the British were -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was a four power city and the British strongly opposed any such movement because they didn’t want people going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They wanted the people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> either to stay there or to go to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But General Clay, the American general in charge of American forces, was very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He was a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And he -- he -- he was helpful in our evading the -- or avoiding the British efforts to restrict that passage from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We sent truckloads of people on the -- on that trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The -- and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> -- in the back of my mind there’s a -- a picture of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> loaded with baggage, which belonged to people who were leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and who were going in other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and a little five year old boy, who -- who was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He’d somehow gotten into this and he got on the back of this load of baggage and went off with this truckload of this group of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were taking people to <span class="DLF">embarkation ports</span> from -- I think 1t was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I just -- you know, this little kid, alone, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That’s something in my mind, but I can’t -- I don’t remember the details, but that little boy is very much in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Imagine a boy that age being alone and not knowing what had happened to his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Must -- there must have been a lot of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Course usually, those little -- those kids were -- were killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Were these -- was this organized through the Breecha?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Ach, they did a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They -- they did -- they brought people out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Their main job was to find Jews who had -- I mean, the Jewish quote, nation, had been decimated. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Every surviving Jew was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And they worked in -- when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we supplied them. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We had Feldifing and then we also had this other camp in -- which was -- I’ve got a -- a certificate from the people in that other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It’s in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And it has the name of this smaller - it was just really not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> or a series of <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> in the French or Russian sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And the Breecha would bring survivors -- now the <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was four powered, so they would -- they would come in at night, so they wouldn’t be stopped and the British couldn’t intercept them with these survivors that they had and they would leave the survivors at this small <span class="NPIP">place</span> that -- this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">secondary camp</span> that we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and then the next day, in daylight, those people could be moved in to the -- the big DP camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Now I -- there was a committee -- imagine this -- of survivors, three or four -- six Jews who ran that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> , W-1-t-t-e-n-a-u. That quote, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that’s a group of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in the -- pretty sure it was the <span class="REGION">Russian sector</span> and they took care of people as they -- the Breecha brought them in at night from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They left them there and -- and this was a very important function that the Breecha performed, finding people and bringing them in and -- and we got to know a number of Breecha people and we gave them supplies for themselves and to feed the people they were taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Was all unofficial or illegal or -- but we were able to do that and the -- and they were a wonderful group of people, they -- these were guys who had been in the Jewish brigade, they had signed up with the British army during the war and they’d left <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and now they had giv -- that was their identity, their way to get back to their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They gave their blouses, their British army blouses and whatnot, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors, who then used those, with other ident -- be -- well, they could get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">These people, after giving up their -- this -- the Breecha guys, after giving up their uniforms and whatnot, stayed on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , looking for survivors in the -- in the -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and bringing them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and years later I looked up one of them in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , we had a very warm reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They were absolutely wonderful guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There’s a whole book about Breecha. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was written by a guy who interviewed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I’ve got that book, it’s called Breecha. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It’s a -- I’m not sure the author -- I’ve forgotten his name, interviewed me, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I’m not sure whether it was right here in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , about my experiences with the Breecha. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I can show you the book later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  The other -- I guess the other question 1s, there were these various organizations working after the war in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">You mentioned UNRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The U.S. Army was over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">How did you all work together and wh -- and was that easy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  Well, I can only speak from my personal experience in the American occupied areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You know, the American army was always cooperative and helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">General Clay -- what I was going to say, there was a Yizkor service at some point in that period, at one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and the people who -- the survivors who were there, needless to say, a Yizkor service at that time, for people who were just learning they were maybe the sole survivors was an intensely emotional experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And they started to weep during the service and there was mass weeping and I looked over at General Clay and he was wiping away tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">H-He was just -- you know, a warm, decent human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">This general had a good record -- you know, an important role in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The -- the -- but that was an intensely emotional scene and I just remember him wiping away some tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Where or when was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Cantbeasec.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Well I had -- I had read that -- that initially anyway, the army and maybe to some extent UNRA people were in no way prepared to handle the hundred -- hundreds of thousands, for that matter, of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">That they weren’t always sensitive, that a lot of the U.S. army was anti-Semitic and that it was -- that there were problems, and I --
ANSWER:  No, that’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">All of that is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The -- the army didn’t want to be bothered with refugee problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They -- I mean, they’d fought a tough war. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They had fought well and in the absence of -- of others to play a role, they -- there they were with this refugee problem and these people were difficult, they were demanding and they were some in -- in some instances black marketeering. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And -- so there was not and -- and these army guys were not social workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Maybe some of them were anti-Semitic, but I certainly -- I know there was resentment of these Jewish survivors, who were much more difficult to handle than the -- the non-Jewish, Polish DP’s, who -- many of whom had reason to fear going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because of what they may have done under the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So the army, yeah, there was a -- a just -- now, how they felt about UNRA, I -- I don’t know, but clearly they were in charge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That was military government and -- but I remember one time, this guy coming -- coming into my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> after there had been a lot of criticism of the army’s failure and in the inter -- there had been an intervening week, where they had done all sorts of things to help the DP’s, brought in supplies and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And he came into my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, “Do you -- End of Tape #2 Tape #3

ANSWER:  To my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There had been criticism by visiting delegations of the army and UNRA’s performances in the immediate post-war period, where these displaced person’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were terribly overcrowded and lacking in supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And this army West Pointer, I think he was a colonel, a young, lean Texan, who was in charge of something in that <span class="REGION">area</span> and 1- it -- I wrote somewhere that it was really unfair to put this burden on these army guys, who were not trained at all in this kind of stuff and -- and this officer came in after the criticism had gone to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and Eisenhower then visited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , because of the word of the overcrowded conditions and -- and a lot had been done in -- in -- in that week. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And he came in to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, “Do you agree that we’ve done a lot in this past week?” </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I said, “Yes, you have.” </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And he said, “Would you make a public statement to that effect?” </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I said, “That’s not for me, I’m just a lowly figure here in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ,” and I could imagine if this would be used -- it was just one thing and there was such legitimate outrage at the -- the dawning awareness of what had happened to the Jews and how little was being done to help the survivors in those early days. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And to indicate that in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- to counter that by saying there’s been some improvement in one, small segment, was something I felt would not be my job, as a -- just a director in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But they -- they did, I mean, they got on the ball, after the -- the initial period of inaction, when there was so much criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  As I understand it, in the summer of ‘45, you and a group of people went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">How did that come about, maybe you can tell me who you went with and what you experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Ah, boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I was initially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> after the -- right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Incidentally, there were two chaplains in -- in the army in those days that I worked with, two Jewish chaplains, one named Abraham Klausner and the other Herbert Friedman. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And -- who, as you know, was the head of the United Jewish Appeal and then later, I mean today, is -- isn’t he one of the directors of <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">He works for Wexner, I think, or he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He’s probably retired now. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But Herb was there, in some of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , with Abe Klausner, these two chaplains who were there with the U.S. army and fo-forgot their role of ministering to army -- Jewish army soldiers, when this -- this -- these other needs were so much greater. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But there are two names that come to mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Now, I was talking about the army --
QUESTION:  I was asking you how you came to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> in August of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">With whom and what you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I did bring -- take this team in, consisting of Henri and Charlotte Hightown. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Henri was our doctor and then -- and they gave me that wonderful engraving over there, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But they came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , they wanted to do something and we -- we -- we had to do something -- whatever we could, even if we didn’t have supplies, so I organized this team of the Hightowns and Ruth Lambert, who was a French, Jewish nurse and Holtzer, Leon Holtzer, who was a Polish Jew, who had survived and was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And we went into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we got permission and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> and established ourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The Hightowns did what they could with medical problems, to supplement the -- whatever medical programs were. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Henri gave a lot of inoculations, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And the other two helped in various ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We had a -- we lived not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We took over a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or the army gave us a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And for a number of months in those early days after the war, the JDC did what it could in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> and I think a similar effort was mounted in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish displaced camp</span> in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And, we turned over a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> to the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> -- the -- we had gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> some army vehicle I think, a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That -- it’s not important, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  Can you describe to me your impressions when you went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Well, it’s hard to separate in my mind, the Eisenhower-Patton visit, which was some months after my first arrival there. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Conditions, I think, on my first exposure to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> were worse than -- I mean th-they gradually improved, but 1t was overcrowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="325"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bunks</span> -- it had been just sort of a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and -- and it was -- there just wasn’t enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And supplies were inadequate and people expected that we, as the Joint Distribution Committee, would come in -- I mean this was the big Jewish relief organization, going back to 1910 or so, the European Jews knew about their -- their Joint, it wasn’t called the JDC, it was the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And they expected that we would come in and reef -- after -- after everything they’d been through, surely the Joint would -- would now -- could perform it’s traditional role. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But we couldn’t and -- and I’ve forgotten the phrase we use, but they mimicked it -- they even quoted us unfavorably, “Here’s what the Joint says,” or -- and -- but we couldn’t do any more than just be there as a physical presence in those very early days to -- it -- it had some morale value, when they hadn’t seen anything except their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> persecutors or Germans, or Poles, to see and American team of Jews -- or headed by somebody like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It -- it was a -- a sort of an emotional catharsis for a lot of those people in those early days, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And later Pll -- ’Il see what I have left in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The JDC made it -- took a picture of me, which they used for -- or maybe it was the j -- united UJA putting a- trying out a shoe on a little girl who was raggedly dressed and this became -- I think it was on the fr-front page of the Jewish exfonit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The -- but it -- it -- there was a -- a -- and you know I had not been strongly Jewish identified, but this -- this awakened not a -- not only identification, but anger that so little was being done, or anger over what had been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And the -- and it’s -- I’d never hidden my Jewishness and I certainly, even though I hadn’t been much of a Jew in the States -- a Rosh Hashonah Jew and I didn’t do anything in Jewish organizations in those early years, I -- I -- I never attempted to escape or hide my Jewishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So it was clearly an emotional experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The -- identifying with these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Why couldn’t you do more for them, initially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Well, the JDC had not been able to bring supplies during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Under the Nazis you couldn’t bring anything in. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And in -- 1n the post-war period, or the period after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated, the -- they just -- the shipping was not available. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We did bring some things from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and some things from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but the war with <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> was still going on and it was very -- th-the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were being used to transport troops and whatnot to the - in the Pacific to the battle -- the expected forthcoming battle with -- with <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I -- I don’t remember precisely why we couldn’t do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I do know the -- the expressions of disappointment and anger that the American Joint could do so little for these survivors in that immediate period. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">That’s -- that was before we even -- you know that -- that load of packages that we brought in from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , were just packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They weren’t the basic food supplies that these people needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  What kind of condition were these people in physically, emotionally, medically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Well, we’ve had lots of information about the condition of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated by allied troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  But when you saw these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  But when I saw them -- I was not in any of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> immediately after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The one -- the only one that is -- not even a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a -- well, there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> , but in the immediate liberation period, I don’t think I saw any of these skeletal survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I did see more of them when I went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , people were still coming in from the east, but eve -- but even by then they were no longer the emaciated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> figures that we associate with that immediate post-war period. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But I certainly identified with them and felt that all of this could have happened to me if my parents hadn’t migrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I-It’s not only the Jewishness that came to the surface but the whole American upbringing of believing in justice and fair play and fighting for the underdog, which was something I grew up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I read a lot of fiction and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I had this sympathy for the underdog, wherever it came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And that plus the Jewish identification made this quite an emotional catharsis kind of thing for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  What was -- sort of this -- kind of the morale like? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Were people hopeful? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Were --
ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Yeah... this -- this guy who sort of shuffled up to me, apologetically and said, “Ineshouldic, but excuse me, am I number 33?” </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And I was busy and whatnot, ““What’s he bothering me with? </span><span class="sentence" id="363">D-Does he want a nu -- how to get more food or something?” </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And -- and I had this great feeling of guilt when he -- all he wanted from me was, “Could you help me in some way to find my family, my children?” </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That was -- you know [indecipherable], oh my God, I was resentful of this poor guy and I felt -- tremendously identified with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I -- individual experiences like that mounted, and when I came back to my life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , I -- there was -- I couldn’t talk about anything else, my friends tell me, except what I had just been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I have a couple of guys that were co- workers and they were on th-the War Labor Board before I went overseas and the -- th- that’s all I wanted to talk about, they tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It’s -- that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau camp</span> , which I have the certificate with -- the -- this was the place where the Breecha would bring people in at night, af -- when they wouldn’t be detected. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They -- they had left them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> overnight and then the next day they could be brought into the American sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And -- but we needed this ha -- little <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Breecha could leave the people it was rescuing, for overnight or for a few days until they could be brought to the American sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And there was a -- a little committee that stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> , which sort of kept the <span class="NPIP">place</span> going o-of Jewish survivors, not JDC people and -- and they- they would run -- they would have little plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They had a couple of -- one little kid, Yusso, who was about five, who somehow had survived and he was -- he could sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And there was another guy, he had -- he was Litvack, he was the teacher and one day I -- my little delegation of JDC people in uniform went to vis-visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> and they had auschtella, a little play in our honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And this Litvack with the withered arm had written some words of a song for this little troupe to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Especially this little five year old -- and the song went, in Yiddish, like this, “Anier director in Joint da? </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Yiddish yacholtare, knish came fort. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Venmen zucht azolchenvae, mater az been zug zugt, okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And that went -- there were JDC directors in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and they said, “That song has been haunting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">The people are confronting us with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We don’t speak Yiddish either.” </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And they couldn’t understand that American Jews, Jewish relief workers who couldn’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And of course, you know, most of us had just a smattering of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Even Philip Bernstein, the -- who was the advisor to Eisenhower on Jewish affairs, Eisenhower or the nec -- or Clay, one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And he was a -- it was a top notch job. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He was a friend of mine, his younger brother, even today -- Phil died a long time ago, but he -- Phil and I both had to appear in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in someplace to speak to a group and neither he nor I could speak any Yiddish and everybody was aghast that our -- an American -- here’s a rabbi who can’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And -- and that was some experience, I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  What was the translation of that song?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  “Anier director in -- in Joint da.” </span><span class="sentence" id="389">There’s a new director in the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Anier means new, “Anier director in Joint da,” -- here. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">A new director in the Joint here. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Yiddish -- ‘“Yacholtere, knish came <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Yachol is one of those untranslatable word, but basically he cannot speak a word of Yiddish. “</span><span class="sentence" id="394">Venmen zucht azolchenvae.” </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Now, azolchenvae is - yar -- ee, yachol 1s translatable, azolchenvae, I remember my parents throwing up their hands at something that was impossible, saying, “Azolchenvae.” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Whatever it means, it’s just sort of an expression of -- of hopelessness. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So this song says, ““Venmen zucht azolchenvae.” </span><span class="sentence" id="398">When we say “azolchenvae, mater” the -- he thinks, “mater az been zugt,” okay -- he thinks we are saying okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And that song just -- which this wonderful guy, Hush, yeah -- was it Vichovsky -- wrote in my honor, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> was spread all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  How much time we have still? </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Let’s see, we’ve got about six minutes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  After you were there awhile, there was the famous visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  If you can tell me how that came about and describe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  The -- the word had leaked through that there was -- that conditions were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That for these poor survivors to be living in this kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> while the Germans were living still, luxuriously in their own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and their blonde children looked healthy and then were -- they were there, they had survived, they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">There was great resentment after what had -- they’d been through, that they were now being forced to live in this crowded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which had too many people and was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And so American visitors came back and Truman, somehow was told about this and he told Eisenhower to look into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And Eisenhower came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> from where -- whatever his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were, with Patton, who -- who’s army occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Eisenhower was the American general for all of the American occupied parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And they decided to inspect this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was a delegation, the two of them, with their aides. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">One of Patton’s aides, with a guy named Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I went along and Irving Smith, who was the army military government guy in charge of that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He was, incidentally, Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">We all made this inspection together and we -- we went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it was obviously overcrowded and that was when, as we walked past these overcrowded <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and also the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> , Eisenhower said to Patton, as we looked at the overcrowded <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , “George, if Harry could see this, he would blow his top.” </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And that indicated that Truman had gotten in touch, after he’d heard these complaints, with Eisenhower and said, “You’d better look into this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And then we -- Patton, whose <span class="REGION">territory</span> this was and who had been shamefully neglectful of what -- of th-the -- the needs of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">When we walked past a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where there was -- there was some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> to put them on and Eisenhower said to Patton, “George, I don’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">If we had some cannons in here without stands and we had some stands here, without cannon, neither one of those alone would be of any -- do -- would be any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So what we would try to do would be to put them together in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , don’t you agree, George?” </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And that’s when Patton said, “General, when I was here last time, this condition didn’t exist.” </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And he had never been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But he just felt he had to defend himself, which was sort of pathetic, because he had such a great record in -- as a fighting general, but he really -- he really couldn’t care less about this and he -- he besmirched his -- his record really, by his -- he just wasn’t qualified to be a general in charge of civilian -- allied civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It hurt him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  You want to change it? </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We need to change the tape.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We were talking about the Eisenhower visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">As I understand it, that was at the time of Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Do you remember that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  I -- I was just trying to -- I have an image of what it must have been like to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> on the first high holiday after the war and it -- it -- if you participated in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  I just don’t remember what we did about Yom Kippur in that first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The -- there was - nope, nor Rosh Hashonah, the -- at some point I -- I think we brought 1n matzahs for Passover period. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we brought in matzah.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I -- I didn’t feel that I could comply with the wishes of this West Point Lieutenant Colonel or if that -- to send out an official statement as a representative of the JDC, that all was well, or that things had greatly improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I said, “That’s something -- th-that’s only something that the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> would authorize,” and to give the impression that all -- th-this could be interpreted as meaning that the army had discharged it’s responsibilities and all was well, when in fact that was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And the army -- I -- I was never critical of the army, I felt th-they were simply not equipped, not trained to be relief workers, particularly for this unprecedented situation of highly -- the people were distraught, as they were beginning to realize what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And they were unwilling to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they -- some of them immediately started to do black marketing and we had a situation in which -- a friend of mine, later he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , I -- I don’t think he’s a-around any more, who was one of the people -- he was a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> the people elected their own camp committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Elected them, picked them or somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">People who were going to be there for awhile and Joe Lifshitz, who later came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> had it -- was a member of that committee and the -- and they acquired -- I think they -- some guns or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They -- as a police organization they had to have some -- some firearms. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And the army somehow learned that these difficult people or -- had armaments and they raided <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> in the middle of the night, rousted everybody out, to find these armaments. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And they arrested these several people who were on the camp committee and it was so stupid, I mean it was so reminiscent of what these people had suffered under -- under the -- the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And -- and then to arrest some of them for having unauthorized -- I remembered there was a military judge, a military government or an army judge, before whom they were brought and I went with them to this judge, who was a very decent man and I -- I said, “Look, your honor, this is ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">You know, these people are our friends, they’re our allies.” </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And -- you know, he -- he -- he immediately agreed and he discharged them, but the army had been so stupid in arresting these people and treating them as though they were just like some Germans who were somehow violating the regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And -- so that was something -- one -- one instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But I was -- there was this Major Fisher at -- third army. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Eisen -- Patton’s army was the famous third army and they -- their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they had -- th-th-they were in charge of -- of these <span class="REGION">areas</span> where these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were and f -- I went over to this guy, Major Fisher, in Patton’s <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , who was presumably in charge of this sort of thing and I said, “Look, can’t you do something to relieve the overcrowding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It’s terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">The -- after what these people have been through.” </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I’d been driving through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> to try to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that -- a <span class="DLF">farm</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span> or something that could be used and there is this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span> -- what did I -- did I say there was another name for it? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Did I mention that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  [inaudible] hausen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Anyway, which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , which is a series of small <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and whatnot, which the -- the Germans had used for, I think army people and the -- there were Polish officers, or members -- Poles, who had somehow taken control of that and were living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And -- and it was outrageous that these Poles, many of whom had fled because of their -- not only bec -- some because they didn’t want to live under the Russians, but others because they were afraid they’d be made to pay for their anti-Jewish and whatnot actions under the Nazis -- their collaborations. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And -- and I- I said to Fisher, “Can’t we use this Wulfratshausen c-camp, with it’s wonderful facilities, to siphon off this overcrowding at -- at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And he brushed me aside and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Then came the day when Eisenhower and Patton were visiting and there was the conversation where Eisenhower -- where they saw the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> without bases. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And we were walking away and they were talking about how overcrowded it was and this f -- that was when I heard Fisher for the first time say, “Oh, by the way generals, we’re about to relieve this overcrowding by this new Jewish displaced person’s camp, which we are just opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And that was -- up to then he had firmly refused to entertain that idea and I-I heard it for the first time when he felt that he had a problem and he’d better try to do something to protect himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So that was something I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  Now, at this -- at this point in time, was Feldifing mixed Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  No, no, it -- 1t became all Jewish fairly -- fairly soon after -- oh, I don’t know, after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The -- it was just so plain that you couldn’t keep them in -- Jews and non-Jews together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="475">First because of the Jewish needs and second because of the hostility the Jews felt towards the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They -- and they, as I say -- and many of those Poles included people who had come voluntarily to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work for the Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  So this happened before Eisenhower came over there? </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He came in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Of ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Yeah, I sus -- well, but 1t was in this visit by Eisenhower and Patton, where Fisher, for the first time, mentioned that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span> was now going to be used for Jewish DP’s, but when were the Polish DP’s moved out? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Somewhere around that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It- it was just clear you couldn’t kee -- I think they were only together for a short time after the war in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I-It was very clear you couldn’t keep them --
QUESTION:  And it was Jewish DP’s who were moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">What other improvements do you think were a result of the Eisenhower visit? </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Or of the Harrison report for that matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  Ah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I -- I spoke to Earl Harrison, a Philadelphian and connected with Wilosco, I believe, at Penn. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">On his way -- he and Joe Schwartz made this visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the period after the war and they stopped off at the <span class="BUILDING">JDC office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , where I was then located and I -- I think I -- well, Schwartz didn’t -- I had some meeting with -- with Harrison where I -- I think I told him what to -- or suggested what to look for and just told him whatever I could, whatever he might ask me about his forthcoming visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Now it was that visit that -- was that where they recommended that X number of people be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Was that -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But I only saw him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I did not -- either it was before I’d gone back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or after I’d come out, I’ve forgotten when, but I definitely spoke to him in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , on his way into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The --
QUESTION:  I’m trying to get a sense of the impact of both Harrison’s visit and Eisenhower’s visit and how it enabled you to make some improvements, if -- if at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  Yeah, I don’t think -- I don’t know, I don’t think the Harrison visit, as such, made a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But the Eisenhower visit did, because it was right after the Eisenhower visit that this -- oh, what was his name -- this colonel -- this Texas fighting officer came in and said -- to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said, “My career is in the army, I -- I’ve fought valiantly in -- in the war and now my reputation is being jeopardized by this criticism of these conditions in my <span class="REGION">area</span> -- in my <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And -- tell me what I should do -- tell me what I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I -- I -- I don’t want this hang -- this hanging over me or ruining my record and I-I’Il do whatever I can.” </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And -- and I f -- I can’t remember what I told him precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I guess he did not have any supplies, but I -- it was -- it was a friendly meeting, I sympathized with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He hadn’t been trained for this sort of thing and -- and I sympathized with Patton too. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I mean these were my friends, they had fought the Nazis and I didn’t want to see them -- and I just felt they weren’t trained for this sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  So when he said, “What can I do to keep my reputation intact,” what -- what did you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  I -- I must have said, “Well, if there’s any way you can help us get more supplies and to create more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to relieve the overcrowding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I know I traveled around. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I went th-through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> at that point, looking for a possible place that we could set up another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and the -- and I -- this parenthetically, I would stop at military government officers -- <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , through these other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , not just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and in one of them, the military government officer in charge of this question was R.W. Fleming, Robin W. Fleming, who had been f -- he was later the president of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Oh -- umnot much more important job later. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He was a friend of mine, we had shared <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> together in the War Labor Board and so I -- he was as surprised to see me as I was to see his name and -- but I was looking for <span class="REGION">areas</span> and I asked him t -- if he had any suggestions that could be used to set up a new displaced person’s camp, to relieve the -- the overcrowding at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> and I just don’t remember how that worked out -- whether UNRA created another <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> to relieve the overcrowding at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> or whether people just left. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They didn’t want to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> of course, they wanted to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And there was this other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> that I think might have been created to relieve the overcrowding at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But there was some improvement, I don’t remember the details, nor my -- my role.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  What -- you had mentioned <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Was there a lot of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Oh, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The -- there was a lot of it by everybody, but -- in that -- in the post- war period. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">The -- there were Jews living in regular -- out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , they had managed to establish themselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and -- where they had some money and they didn’t -- if you could avoid living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , you of course, did and there were these people living in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and whatnot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and for awhile we had an -- a <span class="BUILDING">JDC office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunenstrasser</span> -- K-a-u-n. And black marketing was rife. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I suspect it always is where you have this kind of a -- a rigorously controlled economy, with great shortages. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And the -- and there were, I’m sure, Jewish black marketers and some of them were probably living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> and I don’t know, I think they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I don’t remember defending anybody who was arrested for black marketing. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">The only court appearance I remember was for these -- the camp committee guys, who had firearms and were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  So there wasn’t much effort to control this <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  No and I don’t know how -- oh, I’m sure the army made efforts and there may have been some arrests I didn’t know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I -- I wasn’t in charge of all -- of all of the Jews of <span class="REGION">Bavaria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Another <span class="REGION">area</span> that’s -- I’m curious about, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , not a DP ca -- you know, not a [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  The Centralle Committee of Liberated Jews of Bavaria was the committee that had established itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Central Committee of Liberated Jews of Bavaria. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">A doctor Greenberg, I believe, was the chairman. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He was a medical doctor and -- who had somehow survived and -- there were people who were in fairly good physical condition and maybe they’d lived in the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or something of that sort and they had decent clothing and -- and Dr. Greenberg went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> before too long, but he was just a natural leader and he was the leader of this Central Committee, and there were several other people whose names I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But they were located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and maybe in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we had our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I certainly would have wanted to help them to the extent that I could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Was there a relationship between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  The German Jewish community in -- which I was more familiar with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was composed of people who were 100 percent Jewish, people who were 75, 50, 25 percent Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">There was a whole range and of course the -- the 25 percenters were persecuted much less than the 100 percenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I mean, they were not sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">They might have had reduced rations, but they had more than the 50 or 75. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Everything was, you know, German -- meticulously worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">If you -- if you ca -- you got a better card if you were only a 25 percent Jew than if you were a 75 percent Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I remember that and the -- so there was -- no, wait a minute, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It’s the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">People suddenly proclaimed their Jewishness because -- there was, I know, some sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I guess people -- if you got more as a 75 percenter or even a 100 percenter, people were now emerging and claiming to be Jews because they wanted the favorable treatment of supplies and getting more food, getting packetten -- packages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  But what I’m trying to understand is -- the German Jewish community --
ANSWER:  All right --
QUESTION:  Was it open -- was it open -- did it have a relationship with the displaced persons who had come in from --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They were -- they -- they -- the local German Jewish community -- like German Jews have been different in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from eastern European Jewish immigrants, the -- I knew a few members of the German Jewish community -- I believe it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , who had survived the Nazis by either living without ration cards -- they were unregistered, or they -- they may have been registered, but they were on reduced rations, depending on where they -- they were 25 percent Jewish or 75 percent Jewish, assuming they were not deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Some of them had friends in the non-Jewish community who -- who helped them, though in those early days, nobody had a surplus of food allowances, the -- but there -- so there were these German Jews, we -- well, as a matter of fact, what am I talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="545">There was an organized German Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , with a president and their own -- it was formed right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Th-They -- we worked with them, there was a -- they -- there was a doctor something or other, who was a -- not a -- I don’t think a medical doctor, who was the head of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And oh, they had an -- an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , Julius -- Julius something or other, I guess was actually the -- Dr. Fabian was one officer and a Julius -- Julius something was -- who was -- I mean Fabian was cultured, educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Julius what’s his name was a rough and tumble, less educated sort of guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But they emerged and reorganized the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and claimed property that the - I guess it was called the Gaminda, they claimed property that had belonged to the Gaminda and -- or whether it had remained in Jewish -- that property remained in Jewish possession, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But definitely there was a committee of -- of German Jews that Dr. Fabian, Julius what’s his name and a -- this Julius guy was the sort of guy who could capitalize on -- on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">He would use it to his advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Did they welcome the non-German Jews, who had --
ANSWER:  The eastern European Jews -- the -- there had traditionally certainly been a distinction, culturally, whatnot, between the German Jews and the Austume, that’s what they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And when the war ended, eastern European Jews were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> not only from having survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but they were now pouring in to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , as the Russians prepared to take over all of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and -- and irony of ironies, the place they ran for refuge and escape was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Voluntarily coming into the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that had so destroyed the -- the -- the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And th -- and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> became a haven -- primarily the American occupied areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  I don’t -- I don’t know that there was any -- any real relationship after the war between the German Jews and the eastern European Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The German Jews took over the properties and whatnot and they certainly had people who had needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But I -- for the traditional separation between Polish Jews and German Jews, I don’t remember, but I -- I- I’m fairly sure that the divide continued, that they were -- the Polish Jews were taken care of by the displaced person’s, wh -- I’m trying to remember the name of the omino director of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="559"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  I believe until December, *45. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Initially, we -- my little team, which we organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and which I then went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with -- in the summer of ‘45 and we stayed -- and I stayed until the end of ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And -- and I went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and then in January ‘46, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I think those are the dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  And why did you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Well, Joe Schwartz -- I was ready to quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I had another career and this was something that I intended to do on a temporary basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I had my -- I had a very important experience in ‘45 and I didn’t want to become a social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But Schwartz persuaded me that in December ‘45, in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , when I was talked in -- to go back in and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And he said, “This time we’ll want you to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I went to work in January ‘46, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I think, working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">No, not Feldifing, Schlacktenza, with Fishbein, who was the under-director, a brother of the famous Morris Fishbein, of the American Medical Association. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">That was the end of ‘46. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Have Is --mentioned how long I worked for the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Was it about four years? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">From the end of ‘46 to -- I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and worked on the restitution program and other things that I’ve mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I was -- I guess the JDC’s general counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I was the only lawyer who they employed, but they called me their general counsel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza</span> like, what did you do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Well, it was overcrowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">There were two places in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenau</span> , this small place in the French sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where anishe -- and the JDC clearly supported that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and that was where the Breecha brought in people. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And that was on -- the one thing we could do was support and help that unofficial <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It was not -- 1t was not an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRA camp</span> and they couldn’t get UNRA help. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And then there was this large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza camp</span> , where the director was Harold Fishbein, a brother of the famous Morris Fishbein, of the American Medical Association. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And Harold, he was sort of a character, but he was the director and if we -- we tried to help in various ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The -- now at this time, the -- the Hightown’s were no longer a part of the picture, they had gone back to their careers. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They -- they were part of that picture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , but in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we had two directors. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We -- a guy named Henry Levy came -- the JDC signed him up to go back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with me in January ‘46. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And Henry was a trained social worker and we became co- directors of the JDC program in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and -- which the army gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Peppy may not have come with us originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Peppy was Henry’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And w-we -- we helped with tracing, we did bring in some supplemental -- supplementary supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We tried to help with m-migration. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">W-We weren’t -- both of us in that -- both Henry and I in that picture, for too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I think the -- the JDC or the UJA sent him off someplace else before too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But there’s this one incident of a humorous nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We -- one of the things we did was to try to -- I mean, we did it once. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We -- we lived in this large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallum</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we had a sort of an evening party for the committee of the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And they came to this -- these were people who were middle class, whatnot, they hadn’t been to any kind of a party in a luxurious <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , no less, after -- for years, I mean ever since they’d been deported by the Germans to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And they -- so they came to this <span class="BUILDING">luxury house</span> that we had, to celebrate a party at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was in their honor and they borrowed -- one borrowed a jacket from a neighbor, another one borrowed a dress from a neighbor and in the -- this sort of -- an -- none of the clothing was luxury clothing and they -- they came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for this evening and one of my famous goofs was, I greeted them at the -- at the <span class="DLF">door</span> as they came in and I wanted -- I was the host and I wanted them to feel comfortable and I -- I wanted to say, “Take off your coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Take off your things,” I -- which we would say. “</span><span class="sentence" id="634">Let me have your clothes,” is -- which is what you say when you greet somebody, I guess, even today, if -- “Let’s have your things, let me have your clothes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I translated clothes into a Yiddish word, which my mother used to use the word vesha in Y1-Yiddish, to describe when she was going to put the clothing in the laundry or the wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">She said, “I got to do the vesh.” </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So vesh became clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The expression was, “Let me have your clothing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So I greeted -- greeted these poor people as they came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , “Guden haben mein adaman, mein herr. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Sienzi haas,” take off, “eer vesha,” your underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But I remember the panicky expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">What kind of party is this we’re coming to? </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And that sticks in my mind as one of my major goofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  What -- what was different about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza</span> than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , your experience there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza</span> was a -- compared to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">luxury camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It -- it had much more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , much more facilities and -- and it was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , people could go back and forth and circulate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And more supplies were available now. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And it was less crowded, had more supplies, more food than -- it was within a large community. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> was 20 miles or so away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">This camp was right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">People could move around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and carry -- many of them just left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and got into businesses of various arts, legitimate businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  And this was also a little bit later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Well, it had to be in the year ‘46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  So maybe the situations --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  More under control, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think everything ha -- was. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Conditions had improved from my days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , the external conditions had 1m -- external surroundings had made it possible to do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">The -- but Morris Fishbein was the director and I tried to -- we tried to help him as much as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">He of course, had all -- UNRA supplies and whatnot, but if we could help with tracing, with immigration, reli -- with services, religious services, we did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">This business where General Clay attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  What -- I’m sort of curious at this point, because it is -- now there’s a little bit of a distance, time-wise, from the war end. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Were people really be -- at this point, able to rebuild their lives and perform new associations -- was that something that was palpable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We had a program in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I did make a trip back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">In fact, the army newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , the American army newspaper -- it was a four power city, printed some pictures of -- that I took while on my visit back to Warsaw- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And they were just -- and the Germans had bombed the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were just digging out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">There were no survivors, but there were skeletons that had been hiding in <span class="NPIP">places</span> that had been bombed and whatnot, by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">That had been dynamited, blown up by the Germans and skeletons were being pulled out of these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and they -- of people who’d been hiding from the Germans and then been inundated by whatever the Germans did to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And that was -- I could go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> because the jo -- JDC had a -- they’d always had a program in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and Bill -- Bill -- the long time director of the JDC in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Bill -- oh, I almost had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I may have mentioned it earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So I went back and -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and I -- he -- he took care of me and -- and I -- that’s when I visited the -- these piles of rubble that had been the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> and took pictures, which were published in the army newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> when I got back -- of dug out <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> where the Jews had been hiding and had been reduced to skeletons when they were found after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And that -- I don’t -- that was ‘45 probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Bill Bar -- William Baren, B-a-r-e-n, was I think the JDC director in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Yeah, Bill Baren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  Was there a sense in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlacktenza</span> that people were being resurrected? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Able to move on with their lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  ...Gee, now they’re -- Herbert Friedman, the famous Herbert Friedman, who was the -- the Wexner person, initially the head of the United Jewish Appeal in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , was a - a -- with the army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And he was -- he had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that he maintained. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We -- we were really, became pretty close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">He -- he was the chaplain, stationed with the army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but as he and other Jewish chaplains, who were in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> where there were remnants of the Jewish community, the Shehari taplata was a Hebrew word for the remnants of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Herb would furnish them -- he had -- there was a chaplain’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he would furnish them evenings or some escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and then I -- I f -- whether it was the same time, I don’t know, I had this - this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we also had people, where Henry Levy and I lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Did you know Herb Katsky, was he in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Jake Trueb was my immediate supervisor, he was in charge of both -- wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , yeah I think Jake -- who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , incidentally, right now -- I think- now Katsky appeared -- I don’t remember seeing Herb in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I just don’t --
QUESTION:  So, did you ever work with him at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  Well, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  But back in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  Back 1n this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And he was the one who collected this history and I -- I gave him a taped interview at some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">That was his job with the JDC, but he had clearly been -- I mean, at that time he was preparing the history of the Joint Distribution Committee, or contributing to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I don’t think Herb -- if I had any supervision, it would have been Jake Trueb and Herb Katsky was over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Mife -- I’m not sure -- I think Herb was in Europe or <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at -- at one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  I was just trying to remember whether you had worked with him over there, but I guess not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  I’m not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Anything else you want to tell me about your experiences in the <span class="REGION">Berlin area</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I always get a sense of -- wh -- you know, in all of this European work, what do you think was your most significant accomplishment? </span><span class="sentence" id="701">What were you able to really do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  Well, you know, I -- and there was a great sense of frustration, because we were able to do so little, as I indicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We had no supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">All we could do was furnish personnel to- like the Hightowns, who s -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> were a valuable addition to the -- whatever medical facilities were available in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> for the people who -- these people and -- and the Hightowns came into the <span class="BUILDING">JDC office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 1945, just before I -- I went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they -- they became part of our team and were ve -- a very important -- played an important role in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Now, when I went back later, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , with Henry Levy, Leevy, Levy -- we didn’t -- I don’t think -- did Is -- mention whether that team includ -- I don’t think we inclu -- we had a doctor on that team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  But surely you must have felt good about what you were doing over there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  Well, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The -- it was extremely important, as I mentioned earlier, for these eastern European Jews to know that the Joint was there again, even though the Joint could not do much in -- in connection with -- in reference or com-comparison with what it traditionally did for the eastern European Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But we were at least there. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They -- they welcomed, they would go -- happy to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We -- we did, from time to time, bring in food and we had this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> that -- no, that was -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , was -- was that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I think that was for -- I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">The -- w-we certainly helped with -- helped them get visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We -- we helped them with supplemental foods. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We helped them find relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Our <span class="BUILDING">tracing bureau</span> was very in -- useful in -- in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So I -- I -- I think I had a fairly -- a feeling of being useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Not in any -- y- you could not claim a major role. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We just didn’t have the facilities to play a major role. </span><span class="sentence" id="720"><span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> was the designated organization and we were simply one of several organizations accredited to <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> to supplement what they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Initially, I -- after -- I was there already during the war, I stayed on til December. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in January ‘46. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I believe, until the spring of ‘47, when I left and at that point went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I’d -- I mean all sorts of people were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it was something I -- I didn’t know when I’d be able to do it again, so I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And met some people there - well, I think there were these Breecha guys that I looked up when I was there and I stayed in several <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I -- I was treated like a -- an honored guest and I was sh -- a guide was assigned to me to show me around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> and whatnot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Did you go as a representative of the Joint? </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Or just a --
ANSWER:  As a JDC per -- Joint person. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I went on my own, I paid my own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">There was a JDC program of some sorts, I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">No, this was something I wanted to do before I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And I had no official role in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  How was the experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  Well, it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I mean, I just -- as ve mentioned, I had this sort of re- awakening and <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was -- it was not yet officially a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> , but it -- it certainly was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The -- I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> -- I don’t remember too much about that, I_ITw-
QUESTION:  Was there an -- was there an -- a special energy after the war, so many people trying to -- to get there and the reality of it becoming a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> was closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Was there something special about being there at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Well, now the British tried to close it off and there was that illegal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that went from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">What was that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Around °47, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">That’s -- and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from ‘47 to ‘51 or so, working for the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on various things, including the Claims Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The people -- did I describe that, the -- the -- there were, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , I think that I must have started this -- there were people who had jewelry, who had dollars and the JDC, under Gussic had a program in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">What had been in the JDC program in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war and Gussic borrowed from -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gussic</span> and -- to bring in supplies and things for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Needed money, needed -- and he would borrow jewelry and money and whatnot from people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so he could bring in supplies from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and -- but he owed those people and after the war, there were people who had some sort of writing -- wh -- they came to the <span class="BUILDING">JDC</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and they said, “My uncle or my brother or I loaned money to the JDC in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> that -- and I was glad to do it, I could get -- I felt safe I’d be paid -- repaid someday,” and w -- but we couldn’t just automatically honor every claim, people could -- there could be fraud, so we set up a -- the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> set up a Claims Committee, and I, as the JDC’s counsel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , worked with that Claims Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And that was an interesting experience --
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Let’s change the tape and then let you continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  It’s cause it -- we’re going to run out on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">End of Tape #5 Tape #6
QUESTION:  You were beginning to tell me that you came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and you got involved with a Claims Committee --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  Through the -- through the Joint.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  That was a really interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">The -- the JDC had borrowed, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , Gussic and his --
QUESTION:  All right, you -- actually you had explained this, so --
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">All right, so now we have to pay back these loans and the records are poor and the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is beginning to get requests for repayment, either by the people that loaned the money directly, or the jewelry or whatnot, or relatives, and relatives who -- who only heard that their father or brother or uncle had loaned something to the JDC, they had nothing in writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Those relatives had died and they just felt that while they were glad to make contributions and so forth, to the United Jewish Appeal, if these were loans, it was supposed to be repaid, as was promised at the time, they would like to have repayments. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">The Joint in New York recognized the validity of that position, but it wasn’t about to give away stuff or recognize fraudulent claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So it appointed a Claims Commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">The chairman’s name escapes me at the moment, but there was a chairman and I think two people, one of them a lawyer -- Saul -- Saul something was the chairman. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I got the first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And I worked with them, I was then the JDC’s house counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I had come back, I wasn’t ready to go back -- come back to my old career and I wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and so Moe Levitt hired me and he needed -- he -- my legal background was attractive to him because the JDC was just now getting into restitution and reparations and he felt that having a lawyer in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">JDC headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> would be a good idea and I -- I -- I wanted to s-stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , for whatever the reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And for about -- I think four years, that I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , from ‘47 to ‘51, I worked for the JDC and th-the Claims Committee was one of the as -- working with the Claims Committee was one aspect of my work for the JDC and it -- it was really an interesting, challenging kind of -- what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">You’ve got -- you know you borrowed from people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you know that you offered to repay them and yet here are people without proof, they only heard from their relatives or they had -- they had- th -- there was not -- know diday were no records and so we set up this Claims Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Saul -- Saul what’s his name and somebody named Stuart, to constitute a Claims Commission to pass on these claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And we interviewed people, we looked at whatever records and I did -- I was sort of the staff person for that committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And -- and we paid back some claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Not in full, it was -- sorry -- number usually partial payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But these were legitimate claims and at the same time, we had to be protected against unverifiable or fraudulent claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So I did that with the JDC for just -- I don’t know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">When I was just living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  And then did that -- did that than grow into a larger restitution organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  Well, then --
QUESTION:  Wait a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Then, separately, there was this restitution program. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">The -- as though -- programs were set up for claims by -- from the Germans, to property th-that had been taken away by the Germans and the allies set up s -- I mean the Americans, the British were less interested in it, I think and I don’t remember what the Russians had -- we had four powers, but the Americans did something to help people claim back either what the Germans had confiscated or which they had left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And then there was the whole business of what do you do with heirless Jewish property left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">That were -- these were -- this was property that was going to remain in the hands of the Germans, if the su -- nothing was done and it would remain in the hands in those cases, where the Germans had been most successful in destroying the Jews, because there were no heirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So where they had been most successful, they would be rewarded by retaining the property. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Well, obviously this was unacceptable, so an organization was created, called the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, to reclaim heirless Jewish property in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Meant primarily the American occupied areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And I worked with earso as we called it, as did Mikania Robinson, who was with the World Jewish Congress, stationed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">The two of us really did the organizing of that program and then in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Benjamin Firenze, who had re-remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the Nuremberg Trials, where he had worked with Maxwell Taylor. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Ben either went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And he undertook a program to find heirless Jewish property in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And -- and then we made claims for the -- the heirless property in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , which is only recently surfaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I’m -- I don’t know why, I don’t re-remember the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">But I was -- I definitely worked with the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I helped establish it with Mikania Robinson and in the State Department recognized it as -- which didn’t come easy, some of the old line State Department types did not like the idea, but this became the official Jewish Restitution Successor Organization for heirless Jewish property that was unclaimed, anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And it was used to -- the proceeds were used for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Now, the Swiss have recently -- what is it that the Swiss have done recently? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They’ve just recently acknowledged that there is heirless Jewish property in their hands, that the Jews who were being deported and whatnot, people transferred their assets to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and no one ever claimed them because their families were wiped out and there were no records and the Swiss, I think, had hoped just to keep it, because there were no claimants and now there is some sort of effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization did not -- I don’t think -- function in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , it just functioned in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And Benjamin Firenze ran the program from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and I ran it from the <span class="BUILDING">JDC offices</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I -- I worked on it with Robinson.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  You're fairly successful at recovering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">We -- Firenze did, I’m sure, a great job of finding heirless Jewish property. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Ha -- it’s a needle in a haystack, in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I mean, how do -- you have records, I guess, but who were the -- the Jewish -- in heirless cases, there was -- I mean, if there were any relatives who had claims, you had something to go on, but without heirs, I just don’t remember how he -- he operated, how he found property, but he found property. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And the odinor government was -- I mean that was -- h-he was a good person and they cooperated in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">The -- but I -- I -- I’m not su -- seven hundred million dollars, does that sound right for the value of the heirless Jewish property? </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Most of which was used for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , I’m pretty sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  Must have been hard to corroborate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  These claims, oh, yeah, the -- for the claims countenfrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  No, even for the heirless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">The -- it was a hit and miss sort of thing, as I recall, but gee, I’m not too clear on the details of -- of earso. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Firenze would -- would have a -- he -- did you say he’s been interviewed? </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Yeah, he would certainly know more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And there was a guy that worked with him who later took my job at the -- succeeded me at the Joint in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaden</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kazen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Can’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">QUESTION:  What can you tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Firenze</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  Oh, he’s -- he’s great. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I'd love to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He was extremely able, very bright and energetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">A little guy, he’s oh, about five two or so and -- but much bigger, in reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And I guess he’s practicing law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> or -- years ago I had some contact with him, but we’ve had no -- no reason to be in contact with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Wonderful, wonderful person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, sort of on a personal level. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">The impact all these experiences have had on you, have they changed you? </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Did they change you, I should say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Well, at the time, I-I certainly don’t -- they caused this strong re-identification with my background, my heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I’m a pretty proud Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I mean I think we have a wonderful history and I’m very happy to be part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">The -- go back these thousands of years and we ve survived, we haven’t disappeared in -- in the general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I think the Orthodox Jews deserve most of the credit for that, during long periods when the -- that was the only f-faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And they went through a heck of a lot. ’'</span><span class="sentence" id="837">m not observant, I -- but I -- I feel very strongly my identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I’m proud of it and my kids -- well I -- I mean my grandchildren got Bar Mitzvahed, my son celeb-celebrates the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">My two daughters certainly are very clear in their identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">My oldest son is just a wandering minstrel type. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I mean he doesn’t really have any identification, but -- and -- and -- I think it’s -- I mean we -- we could have done with fewer Holocaust, but it’s absolutely remarkable the way this group gets up from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and continues to battle for it’s survival and existence and -- and takes pride in being part of this extraordinary tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">It would have been much easier to disappear and fewer people would have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But I think the world would be a lot poorer if there were no Jews left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  After you finished your work with the Joint, did you go back into labor relations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  Labor law?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  I -- I was and am still a -- a labor arbitrator, I arbitrate labor disputes. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But for a long time I was the advisor to the city of Philadelphia on it’s labor relations and dealing with it’s unions of city employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And that’s -- I -- I was on a retainer of some sort and when I arbitrate cases, which I don’t do much of any more, I get paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I’ve got a small retainer which pays for my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> expenses, but at my age, I -- I shouldn’t complain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to say about some of these experiences an-and what they’ve meant to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  First I’m -- you know, I’m very pleased that you are doing what you’re doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I -- I mean, too many things of historical significance get lost and certainly the personal experiences of people like myself get lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And I’ve done a -- a certain amount of memoir keeping, but it -- it’s -- 1t’s inadequate coverag -- I’m trying to cover my whole life and there a whole lot of people who -- whose experiences may be lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I -- I was thinking of the -- the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , they -- are they -- is there still a Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I guess there is. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">The current leaders -- but I'll -- I'll always remember that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I’m lucky to have had these experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  The only other thing I can think of is that earlier you said that when you came back from Europe, you were -- I don’t know if obsessed is the right word, but -- but this was all you could think about --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  -- and talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Maybe you can elaborate on -- on that impact, cause that seems pretty [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah, I got sort of diverted. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I -- I remember aw -- aw -- I mean I had these non-Jewish friends, close friends, I -- roommates and whatnot, in -- in the War Labor Board and I’m ca -- I came back in early ‘51, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , to -- and I -- I mean those friends included Walter Philips, who was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ’s Commissioner of Commerce and City Representative under Mayor Joe Clark. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And Scotty Crawford, who was a roommate of mine in the War Labor Board days and they wanted to know what had happened to me while I was away and I remember feeling I was more than happy to tell them about my experiences, but I do remember feeling great anger at the outside world at what had been done to my co- religionist fellow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">The -- the killing of children, it was just something I could not get over. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And so, for a long time after I came back, I -- I had this sort of can -- this reawakened sense of identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I’ve never been very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We’ve always observed the high holidays and that’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I’ve -- th-the children involved in -- made aware of the fact that they are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And that’s -- that’s my life today, I --
QUESTION:  What about anger toward American apathy? </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Which included Jewish Americans as well, to some extent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Yeah, I remember feeling some -- some anger about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">The -- there’s some deep -- want me to hold --
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  I don’t think I’ve ever -- I certainly had a generalized hatred of -- of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But even - even though I’ve been critical of German apathy, I mean Germans claim they didn’t know what Hitler was doing -- the ones who were not, the Germans who were not actively involved in the Holocaust, I’ve -- I’ve doubted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I mean, I didn’t know how they could not have known of what was happening and they just chose to ignore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I mean it would have -- to overthrow Hitler would have been a difficult thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">He had all the marbl -- all the arms and so I -- I -- I don’t know whether I, if I were a German living under Hitler, whether I would have been willing to risk my life to overthrow him because I didn’t like what he was doing to minorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But I still have sort of -- no I don’t really hate the Germans any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I did 1n those early days, I hated every German I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Even German children that I would see in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , I -- I would say, I mean there’s, you know, a future Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">It just was a blind hatred that made no sense and I’ve gotten over that a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The -- but I think there are people who -- Jews today who won’t go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , isn’t that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I mean they -- they’Il never forgive, even though three generations are -- and certainly Germans have been helpful in ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  Were you struck by American apathy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  Yeah, you ask me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I -- at the time, I had a -- I -- I had the experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of some good guys like Clay and -- and Eisenhower. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">When I got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I just don’t remember that I felt hostility to the American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">In that immediate period, I don’t think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">The war with <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> was still going down. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I don’t think I’ve ever had that feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d like to add, because I --
ANSWER:  You’ve finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  I feel like I’ve sort of covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  My period with the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , four years, I had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and it was not one of my better periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I -- I wasn’t really very busy and I -- and I had too much idle time. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And Moe Levitt -- Moses A. Levitt was not somebody th -- he wa -- was -- wa -- the head of the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Schwartz was the overseas head. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I never -- I could not relate warmly to Levitt, but Schwartz was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I’ve written about Joe Schwartz, those ex -- Jewish exponent article. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">As I indicated in that article, he was a genuinely great man and he just performed -- he was the right man at the right time and he had a - a sense of mission and dedication and courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">He was one of my real heroes, I can’t say enough about Joe Schwartz. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I think that’s it.</span></p>
