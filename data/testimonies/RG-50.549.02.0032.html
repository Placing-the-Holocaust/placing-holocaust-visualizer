ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Yeah, it just props up like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is an interview with Fred Bachner, conducted by Melissa Block, on January 10th, 1999, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Summers</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">This is a follow up interview to a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">This is tape number one, side A. Okay, that’s the technical stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">P’Il hold this and it -- that’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  It’s all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  No, that’s okay, Pll -- Pll get it, cause it’Il be a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I wanted to ask you first if you can talk about where you were when the war ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  When the war ended, I was in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , where I was liberated and met the American troops, who liberated me, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I found out the creation of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Displaced Person camp</span> , by the name of Feldifing, which I did not join. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I had the accommodation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was liberated and after being separated with my -- with my brother and friend from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , we felt lonesome and proceeded to look for some <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , to settle for time beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Okay, walk me through that a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">You had been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with your brother and a friend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  And what -- what were their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  I don’t remember the name of my -- of my friend, but my brother’s name is James Bachner and I happened to meet him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , af-after I survived the Death March out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in January 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Okay, so you were be -- you were being liquidated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and how did you hear that American troops were coming? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">How did you realize that you were free?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> that started to b- bombard the vicinity where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving and the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> itself slowed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And it was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> and the troops liquidated their post, from the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So that what we took and thank God, we were successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> there, where -- where we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing our prison uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And then we were -- we hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and -- until we met the American troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally stopped, and we sa -- went out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> onto the open <span class="DLF">streets</span> and we were stopped by a American patrol, who took us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> and then we were interrogated, and set free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  You were set free, do you remember how you felt when they approached you? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Were you afraid, did you -- did they know who you were? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You weren’t wearing prison uniforms, you said, you had regular clothes on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, we’re -- oh, you -- no, I’m sorry, when we -- when we met them, we were in civil uniforms, that’s correct, but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no hair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were, by a -- sort of a center of the head, the <span class="DLF">street</span> , that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it, there were a little bit of hair, so it was recognizable as a <span class="DLF">street</span> or a mark to be a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And we had a hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they were -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And we choder -- we showed them our numbers on the arm and then they still didn’t believe it, and they ask us when the Jewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes, you know, and t-took us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and drove us to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , where we met the colonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we told them, which wasn’t very much, because within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we had no knowledge what was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So we couldn’t be, in that respect, any great help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">How long were you questioned for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Oh, I would say about a half an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  And do you remember how they received you? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Were you -- Were they warm to you, were they suspicious? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">What was their attitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Well, at first, like I said, they -- th-the patrol who met us was suspicious, and they had all the rights of being so. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then, when we were at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , the people warmed up towards us and they took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> , which was nearby, and they ask us whether we will -- would like to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> , wh -- or whether we would like to have some private accommodations, which we naturally choose to be -- to have the private accommodations, because there was more -- better than the <span class="INT_SPACE">POW accommodation</span> --
QUESTION:  How”
ANSWER:  -- the POW camp accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  And where was this? </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  To be honest about it, I -- I don’t -- I -- I -- on the map I could locate it, but I don’t remember the name, whether it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shwabingin</span> or whether it was nearby [indecipherable] where -- that wa -- it was -- it was not very far out from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , but I would say about a hundred miles or so and that’s -- that’s where we were and that’s where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> also is, close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And you were how old, and your brother, about, was how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I was -- Well, it was 1945, I was 20 years old and my brother was 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Now, somehow -- How did you end up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and tell me about what that was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  How? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I’m sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  How did you get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and -- and what was that --
ANSWER:  Well, we -- you know, it’s a funny thing nowadays, in 1999, I would say, things are more electronically and -- equipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very good, I must say, because people were constantly on the move. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Everybody was looking for somebody and traveling and moving and meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And everybody had the story to tell, and that’s how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or acquaintances from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were in the -- in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> per se, in the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span> , that we were transported in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  So it sounds like, for a period there, before you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , you and your brother were sort of on your own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  That’s right, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We were isolated from any news and from any friends or people of Jewish contact, and that’s why my brother traveled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , to see what is going on there and 0 -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that it would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we could have had a very substantial <span class="BUILDING">German factory</span> and property from the Nazi that was -- evacuated the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which we occupied after his leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Well, tell me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Wa -- This was after you’d been interrogated? </span><span class="sentence" id="58">How did you end up where you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Well, after we left the -- after we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> -- not the D -- the interrogation, see, and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own, and not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> , he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some accommodation. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And he took us into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and comma-commanded to meet the mayor from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And he met the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in a short while and he instructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are not going to sleep on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and to provide us with a comfortable <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and food and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour’s time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we waited an hour and then he came back and he said that he found a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for us which -- and he’s going to take us there and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and need, which actually took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">After we took the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we looked around, there were three <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and we took all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , pillows and all that into one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and for the first time in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really slept in -- un-undescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Now, this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became the meeting point for the Jewish soldiers that were in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There was also a detachment from the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I would say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people who had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  That is remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I mean, this was very soon after --
ANSWER:  Days -- Days after, days after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  So you had gone from being a prisoner on a packed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport train</span> , to being completely on your own, in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with -- I mean, I’m just trying to imagine what that must have felt like, to make that leap so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Well, it sust felt like -- like being newborn and you started your life over from the beginning and you met people, and you -- that you never figured you’re going to meet again, and -- you know, and it was a camaraderie, it was -- unde-undescribable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Did you trust? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I mean, you were still among German people at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Did you trust them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Well, to be honest about it, I trusted them as far as ca -- I can throw them, which isn’t very far, but a -- I -- I -- Is -- I sort of felt I had the upper hand at this particular time, because I knew that the American had everything un -- occupied and I -- I felt that there was very little that they could do, in order to do anything physically, or any other which way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Did you -- Did you witness any treatment of how the POW’s were being treated by the al --
ANSWER:  No, no, it was -- it was afte-after the war, there were na -- no German soldier’s occupation visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is what -- what I knew were -- how -- how a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> looked like, it didn’t look like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but it looked like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you know, one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or the other, there’s no -- not much -- any big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The only thing different was that they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , which we didn’t have in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they were treated different than we were, and there was -- there was a difference in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in the treatment and the accommodations that they had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> than I had in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Did you see any collaborators or perpetrators being tracked down -- rounded up, anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I didn’t see anything of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Although, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , the -- there were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jewish kapos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">That means Jewish people who obtained preference of ser -- supervising the Jewish working force and -- and used their force by beating Jewish people as well as the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And if they came and were recognized, they suffered the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  What do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Well, you know, if somebody came in there and the -- the -- and somebody recognized them, and people suffered under the -- under their treatment, they had now an opportunity to get even with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, to what extent I cannot describe, because sometimes they were brutal and sometimes they were not as brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So it -- it all depended upon the -- the force. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It could have been two people, it could have been 10 people who -- who were together and suffered, you know, and they got even with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But it was, in my opinion, the -- in my o -- in my opinion, legitimate and it was r-right to -- for the revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, it didn’t happen very often, so, you know, it is -- 1t is a matter of -- that the card -- the card have turned. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You know, it is a -- a fact that the people never thought that they going to face the -- the facts, and the day of judgment came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , you said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  And you -- you saw -- you saw this? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Did you witness some of the [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  At occasions I did, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Can you think of one that you remember, in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Well, the -- I -- I remember two or three of them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , it was a -- a point, you know, a meeting point and that was the <span class="BUILDING">Munich museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And th-the Jewish people met there, because it was a very large place where you could congregate. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was not within the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> , it was out of the -- out of sight and that’s where people met and it was known all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So even people from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or whatever, you know, they heard about and that’s -- if they looked for somebody, that’s where they went to see and meet people. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And that’s where -- where these things happened, you know, and it didn’t take much, because there were a lot of people there, to create the -- the -- you know, tumult. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And that’s -- that’s where it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Go ahead, sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Now, it -- it also happened at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish office</span> in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , where people met to register for certain purposes, and there was also a meeting point there, so it also happened there, but not very often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  It happened more at the Jewish mu -- at the -- not Jewish, but at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, it was a very knowledgeable point and it was very well done, I must say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  What -- What would happen when they were recognized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Well, they were physically attacked and beaten and that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They were not shot or killed or some like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But they were beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They got their -- their point -- their -- their point across in that -- that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  D-Do you remember hearing of them say anything in -- to justify or defend themselves, to how they’d behaved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Well, naturally they -- they -- everybody who gets attacked or something like this, always says something to defend themselve, but the -- the main issue was that they said, you know, “We were just prisoners like you and somebody had to do it, and we were selected, so we had to do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But, you know, there’s a difference, like the same thing with the Germans, that you can do something, and you can do it two ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You can do it just to do it or you can put some personal hatred and force behind it and make it worse than it could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And that is the issue and that’s what they did, because the same thing the Germans, I mean, they we -- they were soldiers, but they were soldiers to defend themselves, but to go and put the personal atro-atrocity in the -- 1n -- in the -- in the movements, in the facts, that what killed so many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Hitler did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Hitler said to -- to arrest the Jews and put them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And he -- Somebody else say, “Well, while they in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , why don’t you kill them?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And that’s what they did, you know, they just carried it further and further, so it was more personal hatred 1n it, than there was a -- more of to carry out -- to carry out an order.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I jumped ahead of myself a little here. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You were in the -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this -- is it a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  How long did you stay there and how did you -- di -- wa -- did you have money? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">How did you get by?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, at that time, money was no object, because we didn’t get any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We didn’t need any money because the food we needed to live on, we got from the soldiers and from the German, t -- who had to look for our well being, so that part, there was no -- no need for. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We -- We got some shirts and dresses and all that from the POW, which at the time, one shirt was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We didn’t live like -- like you live today, that you change your shirt every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And our job for the time after the war, where there was nothing available and everything that we had was -- for us was appreciated and grateful, because we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we had only one shirt on for months and months and months and we were full with -- with the lice and all that, so 1-1t was hundred percent improvement. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So we sort of kept -- kept going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Were you -- Do you remember what it was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Do you remember the first thing you ate that tasted good, after having such horrible, horrible, and virtually no food during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Well, we were very lucky, because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> , there was a doctor and he told us and warned us not -- not to eat too much and to overeat, because our stomach was not in -- in the condition to absorb a lot of foods and especially not any fat food. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So we took that -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it worked, because -- well, it didn’t work with me, but 1t worked, because I later on found out that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I found it out and, you know, and -- but, by and large, a lot of people died after the war, from being fed by the English army, more food and fat food than they should have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So there was a lot of people that died after the war, on account of the liberation and eating things that th- their stomach was not equipped to handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you ate? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Anything come to mind, that --

Got to remember where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Tell me about finding your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">How did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">How did you even know he was alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Well, it is a unique -- unique s-situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">You know, like I mentioned before, that word of mouth can work just as well as a radio or a tel -- not a te -- yeah, even television, but the only difference is that it takes longer and it is not instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">My brother was going on the -- was at that <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and a person approached him that we knew from before the war, and said, “What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Your father is looking for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And he was astonished and said, “My father is looking for me, and I am looking for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So where -- where is he, where can I find him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So, he gave us the location where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my father was, where he met him and he spoke with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So, the next day, my brother says -- not the next day, but the same day, my brother said, “I’m going to find Father and I’m going to see what I can do to bring him here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So, at that particular time, there was no transportation yet available. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was not going and it was only going with the help of the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , to the officer in charge and told him what we -- what we found out, that we need some help and to give us a note that the American army should help us and take us along whenever possible, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going -- there was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going in the morning in that direction where we had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So instead of standing in the <span class="DLF">street</span> with the thumb, my brother took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the morning, for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , at six o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And people were hanging on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and inside and any -- any which way. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You never seen a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with people like that -- was just like a Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It -- Unbelievable, where people was -- was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , hanging on, just to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So, my brother took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then he came into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he had to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because that particular part used to be under <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but it was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So, after a three day travel in all kind of ways, my brother finally reached the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my father’s supposed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So he came there and he found the address and he found the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he found the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and guess what? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">My father wasn’t there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">My father had left back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because he figured that if we survived, we would go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where we originally are from. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And he -- he came there and it was already three days that he was -- four days that he was gone, and there was no mail, there was no telephone to get in touch with me, to tell me what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So he started on his way back, which also took about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And he finally arrived a week later, back, and I thought he would come back with my father and he said, “Guess what? </span><span class="sentence" id="203">You know, I came there and there was there and Father was gone, he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So he said, now I should travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I said, “No, you have the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">You go and you travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So we waited a wee -- a week and -- til he got rested up [indecipherable] and then, about a week or 10 days later, he started out to th-the travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he met -- he traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which also took him about three days or four days and he met my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So --
QUESTION:  Do you know how he found him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Well, he had the address, when he an -- when he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there, people knew him and my father left an address, that in case somebody comes to look for him, that that’s where he’s going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And he met him there and naturally the -- the joy was grateful and -- and my father was -- was very sick and it was a friend of his, woman friend, that knew him from before the war, and cared for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And she went with him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So, there was a big discussion about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and finally they decided to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And the transportation and the situation started to stabilize a little bit and we decided that -- to wait another month or so for them to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, he came back and then they waited a month or so and they started out to come and join us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And meanwhile, we got into a bigger <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and when they came, which was shortly after, we were ready for them and had the -- had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and all that, so it was a nice welcome and to -- to see them after all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And my father was very sick and he -- he felt much better and you know, and he had to be nursed back and she did a good job on doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Meanwhile, they got married, by the way.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Did you talk with him then, or afterwards about what you each had been through during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Well, we sort slowly and surely told our stories, you know, because you know, to talk about it very -- each one of us to talk about it, it takes hours for each one to tell you the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So, you know, it took days, when we were sitting down for dinner or for breakfast or something like this, you know, and we memorized it, you know, wh-when -- last time I had breakfast in -- in this and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know, and it was like this, 1t was like that, you know, and then we had to go to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , in March and it was raining and it was snowing, it was cold, it was freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You know, all these things came -- came out after you met and you talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So it was a very, you know, it was a very discu -- big discussion every time the subject came up and it came up very often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  It did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Yes, it did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  You had -- You had mentioned in your videotaped interview that you chose to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport train</span> out of one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , because you had heard your father would be coming to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you couldn’t bear to see him mistreated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  No, actually, actu -- actually, I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when I found out that my father 1s in that next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that’s supposed to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And knowing what I said then, I say that again, that you know, to be together with your father and see the atrocities that are being done to people, and not be able to defend yourself, I personally -- the type of a person that I am, I don’t think that I could s -- could stand still and -- and watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So, I choose to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and go to -- I -- I choose -- there was an opportunity, let’s put it that way, which it was, you know, to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and not be together with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And here, again, I must say, you see how news travel, without -- without electronic help. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Without a radio and anything else, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It just -- that -- if you have a name and you are known, and people know you, or something like that, word gets around and that’s how I found out about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Again, you know, that my father is on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And 1s -- is bound -- is bound to be at the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which actually happened.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Did he say why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Well, I -- He didn’t have to say why, because this is self explanatory, because about the -- the living conditions, the -- the way it was -- you were subjected to certain punishments sometimes, because you didn’t work fast enough and you didn’t do -- walk fast enough and all -- all kind of things, you received beatings from the German guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So, you know every time you see somebody get sent, you know it’s -- it’s like -- like you get hit yourself, because you had to be a -- a witness of 1t and you know, it is like one Jew is -- 1s like your -- your brother, you know, and you feel that -- the -- the pain you go through by being treated that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So, it is a -- a natural instinct.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  But we seen the camp-like situations and we had enough of that, so we thought we fend for ourselves, what -- what you can do, you know”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  Okay, I got you. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So, you’re living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and how do you figure out where your family will go? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">What made you decide to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">What were your choices at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Well, my brother and I, we were talking about it and we felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is not going to be nothing, it’s just going to be pieces of <span class="REGION">land</span> and [indecipherable] wouldn’t be any future for us, because it is going to be a very controlled <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did and carried on and little did I know that there would be a martial plan and all the other things that put <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into -- pro-propelled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into a top position and the way it is today. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And today I am sorry that I did move out from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because I could have been financially the better situation to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> [indecipherable] was. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I could have re-reaped from the fruits of the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> , and like I said, I could be in a better position in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a refugee the way I came than I -- if | would have waited another two years, is all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So you think if you did it over again, you might have stayed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Well, if you ask me, then yes, I -- I -- I will say -- I will say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Because I -- I -- personally left for the solid rea -- solid reason that I thought that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will be no more <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it will be a poor <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , it will be a -- under control. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It would not be given the liberty that it enjoys today and enjoyed right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I -- I -- I must say I was wrong, because politics sa -- play -- play -- are strange bedfellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">That’s wa -- That’s what it boils down to. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But you cannot look into a crystal and know what -- what the -- the future brings, because lot of people would commit suicide if they knew what -- what -- what would happen to them in the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But, nevertheless, the way it is, you know, it is -- it’s came, but 1n a -- in a different way and a harder way, that I had to learn a lot of experience by being here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  So how did you -- how did you decide to come and how -- how did you get here? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">How did that all come together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Well, like I mentioned before, we decided that -- that since we figured that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 1s not going to be any more anything in the -- in -- in -- in this -- in the world, it is better to go to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which 1s going to give us some possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And at that particular time, there was a note at the Joint Distribu-Distribution Committee that President Truman gave 20,000 visas to Displaced Persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And being that my brother was working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the -- of the Joint Distribution Committee, he knew about it and he registered us to -- to go to the -- to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  And did that -- did it come together fairly quickly or did it take a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Well, no, it -- 1t came -- it came pretty quickly, because we were -- we got the permission to go in 1946, in June, but unfortunately, a seaman strike developed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> did not go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So we had to wait til the strike is settled and then we were able to go to -- into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  And did all four of you come together?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  Well, we were told to go to -- in September 1946, we were told that our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is going in September to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that we should proceed to the staging area -- area in <span class="DLF">Bramer harbor</span> , which we proceeded to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We arrived in <span class="DLF">Bramer harbor</span> , we found out that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> are not going and we waited in <span class="DLF">Bramer harbor</span> three months, until the sh -- the strike was settled, and in January third, I believe it was, 1947, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">USS Ernie Pyle</span> , which was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop carrier ship</span> , and proceeded on an eventful trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The eventfulness was that it was a stormy -- very, very stormy voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">For a week, we did not leave the <span class="DLF">berth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was cordoned off with ropes. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We could not move it, because that’s how the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was moving, up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And the captain took a side trip over, to avoid the storm, to get out of it, over <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , which was worse, because it was very icy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, in all, the trip took us about 14 -- 14 days and we arrived here in- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on January the 14th or 15th, 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Tell me about that moment, you -- you sailed into <span class="DLF">New York harbor</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Was that --

<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were thinking as you came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , seeing the Statue of Liberty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Well, all kind of thoughts went through my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">How am I going to get a job, how I’m going to work, how I’m going to make a living, or -- you know, all these things this come -- come to -- to your -- to your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And it is a, you know, it is, you know, it is a moving, moving situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It -- You know, it -- as a young man, you -- you -- you don’t know what -- what you -- I didn’t have a profession and here I’m 20 years old and you know, it -- I’m sorry, I’m 22 already -- am about to be 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But it leaves -- it gives you fa - some food for thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, we landed in va -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Marseilles</span> and we met some other people here who came with -- two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> before, because we were only the third transport to come from -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Well, at -- at that time, to have people surviving from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , 1t was a rare situation, and the press ask us about our experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and about the voyage and all that, because we were way overdue, on account of the storm that we had on the Atlantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So, that was the reason there was the press there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And at that time, you know, to have people survive the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , it was a novelty, not -- not like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I mean, 50 years later is -- is more than 50 years ago, you’re right. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It is -- It was a novelty here, to be a survivor and the press was there, hungry to have news from -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that we were -- were in.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  Perhaps a small suitcase, that’s -- that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I mean, the -- the clothing that we acquired in the time that we were liberated, because don’t forget, from 1945 to 1947 is only three years and we were not in the -- financially in the -- in the great position to -- to ob -- to obtain anything, and we all -- and I felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is not going to be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so why should I go out and settle myself with things and clothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="391">If I go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the style is not the same and, you know, so you have to get rid of it anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So that’s why we just had a small suitcase and -- and that’s all.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  Tell me about the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Well, it -- it wasn’t the -- the -- the <span class="DLF">Park Plaza</span> , or it wasn’t the <span class="BUILDING">Waldorf Astoria</span> , but it was an acceptable <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , it was -- it was nice there, the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> there for us, where we could obtain food. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And it wa -- it was occupied I think by elderly people and not the transients or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So, it was -- but when we moved in, it was -- it changed completely because the Joint opened an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there and people came and you know, and some people found relatives and you know, they came and visited and all that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It did -- started to be a different -- a different picture than it was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And, you know, it -- I think that the Joint moved the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> up in prestige.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  How do you explain that to yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I wonder if your experiences during the Holocaust have -- have made you think of those sort of happenings in a certain way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Well, to be honest about it, there’s no explanation there. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">That’s -- It’s the same way I met barba -- my brother, after five years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you know, I never thought it would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And here, you know, is like -- like -- like you say in -- in Jewish, it 1s pershared, you know, that it is meant for you to -- to go through this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So, I take it in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">That, you know, it was meant for me to meet him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So it doesn’t feel like luck? </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It feels more determined than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Luck? </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I -- I wouldn’t say that it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It’s -- It’s meant to be, you know, like some people cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> and get hit by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">An-And so how -- how do you explain that? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It’s being in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the wrong time or right time, or whatever it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So -- But it happens and that’s -- in my opinion, that’s the way life 1s, so you know, it 1s a unpredictab -- unpredictable situation that you can -- you know, your -- you encounter in your lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So it is, you know, God -- God steers your way in life, and that’s -- that’s why you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, you beg for forgiveness and beg, you know, not -- not to die in the course of fire or in -- by sword, by -- by -- or by a gun or so on, so forth and -- and then it’s up to the Almighty -- Almighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So this is the -- a matter of, how you call, destiny, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="867">QUESTION:  Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I can’t -- I can’t say. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Although I met the -- the principal and I know that the Jewish -- the Westchester Holocaust Commission is in touch with him, but I don’t know for what reason nobody is able to talk about the Holocaust to their -- to their students.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  Did -- Wha -- The trip that you took to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , did you -- do you think it -- it was worthwhile? </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Did you come back thinking that you had accomplished what you had set out to accomplish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I -- I got a very good reception from the principal. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">He gave me a book as a -- as aremembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And I think I -- I left some -- some important points there. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">That fellow German, although I’m not German, but the fellow who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was all of a sudden subjected -- subjected to these kind of treatments and endurances in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So I -- I think that I accomplished something in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I mean, I go here and I talk to kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you should see the letters I get back from the -- from the kids, you know, that the impression they get, of what I will -- what I told them, you know -- I didn’t tell them all the -- the bad things, but you know, th -- they -- they -- they got -- kids get something out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  Do you think they do understand it, or as much as they can?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Most definitely, because kids today are definite -- than kids when -- when I was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Kids today have radios, they got <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> , they got all kind of -- all kind of help and they know -- they learn earlier than we started to learn and education is -- is admitted in a different way than when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">So, it -- it’s a different ball game.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  My motivation here is that, first of all, to tell kids that were -- things that can happen to one in this lifetime and to be aware of it, that things can happen, even here, with a democracy and with all the freedom that you enjoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Because, if you stop to analyze things that are going on around the world, we s -- we back in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that -- that we were before. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Not in the same -- to the same extent, but it does happen, you pick up the paper and you have it in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , you have it in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , you have it in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , you have it -- you have it all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So, people didn’t learn yet, so it’s still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And something has to be done eventually, to -- to stop all that, although they -- they created the UN -- the United Nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">The United Nation didn’t do much to stop the killing.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Like I say, experience is the best teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">You know, it is more noticeable and I can see if -- if people hide it and people try to -- you know, try to be anti-Semitic about it and without showing it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And it’s a -- it’s -- it’s more noticeable to me than to some pa -- somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">QUESTION:  P’ve heard some survivors say that they can sort of instinctively tell when someone else is a Holocaust survivor, without knowing anything about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I’m curious if you agree with that or no, if that’s not what your experience has been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">ANSWER:  I agree with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">QUESTION:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">We survivor are a -- a different people and I -- I don’t know, y-y-you know, nowadays people who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> before the war, they all of a sudden became survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So, now we have to start to distinguish th-the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">A Holocaust survivor who was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , for me 1s very easy to detect, on his behavior, on his way -- the way he talks and y-you know, it -- there are certain -- I -- I don’t know, there’s certain -- certain ways that -- that I can recognize a -- a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">You know, the -- we -- we had the language on ourselves by doing certain things a certain way, and I -- I noticed that when they play the football here, you know, the -- the coach stands in the side and he makes like this, you know, all -- all kind of moves and you know, to tell the players how to act and -- and what to do, what not to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">We had that same kind of a language with -- with us, because when -- when we seen a guard came in, you know, and he had something to do and started to hit people or grab people, you know, to be executed or whatever you want to call it, we -- we -- we sense it and kn-knew it, you know, and we gave each other notice of it and tried to hide or tried to do something that -- not to be on the -- in the front, to be the first one to be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So, in case there was anything going on, you know, we tried to warn each other, but it was to no avail, because they did anyway, what they going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So, in that respect, I would say yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  What do you think it is that you see in other survivors that I wouldn’t notice, for example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  Intuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Intuition, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">It’s certain behaviors that we have that 1s not a normal behavior, let’s put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Like, I don’t know, I don’t know how to tell you the certain behavior is, but there’s -- there’s certain instances where I can see how a survivor would behave and behaves, you know, and I can say that this 1s -- this is a survivor of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> not -- not from -- from -- coming early to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">QUESTION:  ’'m wondering if there are things politically around -- either in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or around the world, that have happened since you came here, that have resonated particularly with your experience during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Vietnam war, Civil Rights movement? </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Any of the number of sort of big events that have shaped this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Have any of them sort of affected you more specifically because of your past experience?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">ANSWER:  That’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I have my mixed feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I got attached to my family and -- but other than that, I -- you know, it’s -- you get attached to people, they -- they here today and gone tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And during the war, you got attached to people and they here today, next hour they’re gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">So, you know, it is -- and -- and -- and getting attached to somebody and loving somebody and all that 1s -- it’s -- 1t’s a very painful situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And you lose somebody you love and somebody you’re close to and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Or somebody from the family, a cousin, an aunt, an uncle or that, you know, it leaves a scar 1n your -- in your body. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So, y-you can’t -- you know, it’s -- it’s a -- it’s a personal thing, you cannot generalize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">You know, I feel one way, you feel the other way and it’s a -- like my -- my children, they know that they have t-two cousins and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Then --Not -- Not two cousins, they got more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">They got [indecipherable] just two, and then they have some -- some other cousins in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and they got other cousins in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , but they never met them, never seen each other, you know, it’s -- it’s one of those things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Like here, and in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the distance is so big that it’s a problem to have a family close together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Like in the old -- old times, he used to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and everybody used to live close by and everybody used to see each other on the weekend, because it was a custom that you would -- what do you -- what you doing this weekend? </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I’m going to Aunt So and So and to Uncle So and So and tomorrow we going there and it was a family situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">But that’s all gone, because today you want to go and see your brother, you have to go take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> and travel three hours, four hours and by the time you get to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and from the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , so it’s a days a -- a day lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">QUESTION:  How do you think -- it sounds like you came out of the war with a fair amount of distrust of attachment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">How do you think you were able to form a bond with your wife, for example, that’s lasted as long as it has and you’ve created a family that’s been very stable together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  Well, my li -- it’s a different situation, you love a wife, you love the family and you establish a relationship and it’s a -- it’s a different -- different situation between my wife and somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I mean, you know, I can like somebody, I can love somebody, but it’s not the same love that you have with your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So it’s -- it’s a -- it’s a different ball game, because you can have a favorite aunt, you can have a favorite cousin, you can have a favorite like this, you know, but you like them because the way they react, the way you li -- the understanding you with you’re cousins or with your aunts and uncles and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">It’s -- It is not the same than between -- like between a wife and a husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">So, you know, it’s -- it’s a different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">You feel very bad if an -- an aunt dies or a cousin dies or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">But you can’t say that you actually loved the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So, there’s a distinction.</span></p>
