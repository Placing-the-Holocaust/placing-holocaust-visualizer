QUESTION:  What did you do after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Were you interested in sports? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Did you have any hobbies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  I was at my <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , I was interested in sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That was swimming and track which I participated in. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I was never very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">No, I had what you call letters in it and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But the one thing that I remember very, very closely is right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us lived our physical ed teacher who was an officer in the SS, who took to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I was the best marcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You know when we marched and I also was the best saluter. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And he was a very friendly to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He lived right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And every once in a while he wore his SS uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But I had absolutely no fear or any kind of, other than that he was one of my teachers and he was friendly with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I really didn’t feel any kind of persecution or otherwise until I was told that you had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Hohenzollern gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I was very disappointed because it was a very good <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was close to where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> , way across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I bicycled. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But this was a really relatively short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">What happened was after my father died in 1936, my mother took over his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We lived happily in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In 1937 her first cousin who lived, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They came to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They didn’t come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">My mother went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">She didn’t take me along and I really don’t know why because she sent me off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And they met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was her first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Interestingly about her first cousin who emigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before World War I as a young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He had worked for my grandfather and somehow he had gotten into financial trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So my erandfather said get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I’ll pay you to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and sent him abroad in order to keep him out of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He never forgot that what my grandfather had done for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 9 And therefore, they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And met. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was sort of a family reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He and his wife and their son Jeff who was my second cousin came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And they made the decision that the following year I was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> for one year and my cousin Jeff was to come and stay with my mother for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Sort of be a family exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It developed during that following year he wasn’t going to come but I was going to go for good. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I had an affidavit and I had a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My mother did not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She had, she had an affidavit from her cousin but she didn’t have a visa yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It hadn’t come up yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So I went by myself in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and put me onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Manhattan ship</span> and I went off as a 14 year old to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Yeah, but going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Stay with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  That so I really I should say something else about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I am sure that if my father had lived we would have all succumbed in the Holocaust because he felt he wasn’t German. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He had served in World War I. He had an Iron Cross, actually an Iron Cross that was bestowed belatedly by Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So he was, this was never going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We would have never left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we would have all succumbed if he had not passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So this is one of the, my personal history that I feel that the only way that we really survived is because he had passed away at an early age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Let’s now talk about you as a child in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Did you experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Only on one occasion and it was not really anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was the week before I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My mother had purchased for me a pair of long trousers, knowing that in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> young boys wore knickers but also long trousers. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I had them on, was right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from where we lived and where I was accosted by four or five young boys who didn’t like what I was wearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Whether I was Jewish or not I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And they beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mother, in her usual way, said this did you good so you had this experience of being beat up so you know what will happen to you if you know, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 10 And that was the only occasion that I personally felt it was, that I had any kind of bad experience in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So I really never personally experienced the awful things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> vis a vis the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  When did you first start hearing about a man named Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Do you remember your first impression?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Did you have any physical reaction to seeing them, being German yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I was an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I mean none whatsoever, none whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The German was the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The fact that I was of German origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">No, I was an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And —
QUESTION:  Did you speak to any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  We took a few, we took a few prisoners and interrogated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But it was really purely tactical interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Where do you come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="884">What is the name of your unit? </span><span class="sentence" id="885">How many are in your unit? </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And things like that, just very simple questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Because it was a very fluid situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">But we actually got taken out very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And went back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then we waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I was in the <span class="REGION">Redding area</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until the <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> invasion, in September 17" I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">September 17" was the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And that was a more difficult jump because it was day time. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And there were, the other thing I wanted to mention is we also had glider troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">The 101“ Airborne division had a glider regiment and I was actually assigned to the glider regiment but as a jumper. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And the replacements that we got after combat and injured were all soldiers who were from the glider regiment, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> were much more dangerous than jumping. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">You know and so people, you had to volunteer to be a jumper, https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 35 but to be a glider rider, you were assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So after the Normandy invasion all the survivors of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> volunteered to become paratroopers because 1t was so much more dangerous to be a glider rider. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And so we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we, the 101“ Airborne Division was situated around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eindhoven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">The 82" Division was <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="902">And that was the occasion where the British were annihilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And the reason they were annihilated is we were supposed to, three divisions were supposed to jump and maintain the <span class="DLF">road</span> open for the second British army to move through and across the <span class="DLF">line</span> and liberate <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">What happened is Marshall Montgomery apparently just, they were so slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And here we were holding the <span class="DLF">road</span> open and the British came and they stopped and they had tea in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">They stopped, got off their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And sat with us and had tea and then they never made it to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They never made it and the British were annihilated across the <span

id="911">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> for 70 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">We were supposed to be there for ten days at the most and then again were to be removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">We stayed there for 70 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And the big problem was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Because we hadn’t brought any food with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And we literally lived off the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And the <span

because they didn’t have anything much either. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So what there was of farmers and people who were around, they couldn’t give us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">For once in a while, they got a chicken or something like that but we were there for 70 days and before we were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rest camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> called near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rels</span> [ph] called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mumalo le

</span><span class="sentence" id="926">We went there on the 18" of December, 17" of December and then we were completely isolated and Eisenhower declared <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> the expendable to stay there and not give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">We were completely surrounded by Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And it was General Patton, the

us. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And that tank battalion was headed by Colonel Abrams who was later General Abrams, in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And they came through with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 36 battalion and on Christmas morning reached us. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And broke through the German — the Germans had us completely surrounded and we didn’t take any prisoners there because we were going to be their prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And my one claim to fame in the army was when they came to have a surrender, the 101 Airborne surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I was working on, I mean I was with my colonel by the name of Harper, I was a regimental commander and we were actually right across from <span class="BUILDING">division headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And they sent, the Germans sent in a team to make a surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And what happened was the surrender, the team two officers and two enlisted men were held

the letter to surrender and my colonel and I were with our division commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">At the time was, he was assistant division commander because General Taylor was in

id="943">He said oh nuts, what am I going to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And no idea of — he said oh nuts, what am I going to tell them. </span><span class="sentence"

<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  What does it mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  Nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I said, what is nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I said go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And that you know that became the translation of nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">They left and then on Christmas morning we were liberated and we had not been able to be supplied by <span class="DLF">air</span> because the weather was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">It was snowing and raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And on Christmas morning there was bright sunshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And suddenly the C-47" came over massively, throwing down medical supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Food. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And everything, all of a sudden on Christmas morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">It was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And then after a few days we were sent, we were liberate -- No, we were there for another week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And then we moved out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> and we moved by that time we were very much emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I mean troop wise, we were one third of our strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">We moved over to the right and down the <span class="DLF">line</span> on the west side of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , we moved down. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We saw no combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 37 Practically no combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">It was towards the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">The last three weeks of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And we went, we moved down and ended up on the day that the war ended, on May 6 at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We actually took <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">There was nothing to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And being still prisoner of war specialists we headed immediately for Hitler’s, and we went up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Berghof</span> and then we wanted to get up to the Eagle’s Nest and we found out that we were not the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">There was a French company that had preceded us and they had gone up to the Eagle’s Nest and taken all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and equipment and thrown it down the <span class="DLF">elevator shaft</span> that had been the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So we had to crawl up there by foot to get to the Eagle’s Nest. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">There was nothing there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But they had managed to throw stuff down the <span class="DLF">elevator shaft</span> so you couldn’t use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> to the Eagle’s Nest. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">That’s the end of that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And then we were there for about a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Oh we ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">Berchtesgaden Hof</span> which 1s the fancy <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And we were there for I think four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">When we were kicked out of the <span class="BUILDING">Berchtesgaden Hof</span> and all the high level POWs, the generals and the ministers that were captured around there were put into the <span class="BUILDING">Berchtesgaden Hof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">This is where they held them as prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And we were in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> across from the <span class="BUILDING">Berchtesgaden Hof</span> which was a lovely sort of a <span class="BUILDING">country hotel</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> , you know individual <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And we landed in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we gave the proprietor and the kitchen staff all of our K rations and everything we had and they provided us with food for a month.</span></p>

QUESTION:  And then where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  Well then briefly the 101‘ Airborne Division was taken south to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Gastein</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> which is about an hour south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And we were there briefly and then I was detached. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">I was able, because I had had enough points being in these various combat situation and having gotten by that time a Bronze star, and combat infantry badge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I had enough points to be one of the first to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So I was sent back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Desine</span> [ph], a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I was there for about a week and then was shipped <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And I was actually got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by December eighth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">You know I was one of the first people in my own acquaintance to get out of the army and get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And then I immediately enrolled back to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> on the first of January I was back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Most of my friends and relatives were, like Jeff, they were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  When I finished <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in University of Kansas City I was persuaded by my, Henry Bertram Hill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">History professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He said I should try to get to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">At the school of advanced, he suggested it was the school of advanced international studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">QUESTION:  <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">ANSWER:  Which became <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">At that time it was still independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And they had a <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peterborough</span> , <span class="REGION">New Hampshire</span> and occupied the <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> of a women’s boarding school. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I think they had Kendall Hall School for Girls or something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peterborough</span> , <span class="REGION">New Hampshire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And I was admitted only for <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I was not admitted for the actual <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So I went up there and don’t think I distinguished myself academically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">However, on the weekend before the fourth of July in some reason or other, the cooks of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And left, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was without a cook for the long weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">For the Fourth weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">So before they could go down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> to hire a new chefs for that weekend, I volunteered to cook for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And I think that is what got me into <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> for the https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 39 next year because they couldn’t refuse my application. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">SIAS</span> and at the first week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , my wife Mimi had come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">She had been graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Carleton College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">She had sort of a record there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">She had a absolute A, four years of nothing but A’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">She made Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And she was a valedictorian of her class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">She had actually literally never had anything but an A as long as she was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , until <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> and we had met and that’s when she got her first B and she blamed me for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And so we really started going with one another after the first week at <span class="BUILDING">SIAS</span> and we got our master’s degrees.</span></p>

class="sentence" id="1133">There had been a strict State Department rule that foreign service officers should not serve longer than two years at that time because of the Cold War situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But Tommy Thompson, our American ambassador, such a marvelous person, always thought that two years is too short a time for us really to get involved and he

felt so flattered to be asked anything by Tommy https://collections.ushmm.org November 7, 2013 43 Thompson, I immediately said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to confront Mimi and our two little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">But she was at that time such a conservative in her life style and even politically at that time, she thought anything is better than a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So let’s stay for a third year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And we were the first family to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> for three years, which of course 1s standard now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">It became standard and so we stayed there for a third year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I became - Ed Murrow was the director of USIA and I became one of his assistants,

passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And then I was under, and I assigned myself since I was in charge of Soviet Union and <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> I assigned myself

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and we studied Polish again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">By that time Carl Rowan had left and Leonard Marx became the director of USIA. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And Leonard Marx called me in and says I’m going to make a proposal to you, an offer to you that you can’t refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And I said what’s that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I was ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Within about three weeks.
