<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  After that the Germans came in, and we figure that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavala</span> was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we might as well go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  You made that decision after the Germans came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  My father made the decision, yes, after the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">In 19 -- in April 1941 we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> was occupied by the Germans already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  And what about -- had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavala</span> been occupied by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Well, the Germans divided <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> in three parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Part of gre -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , the <span class="REGION">southern part</span> was given to the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The northern part of was kept for the Germans and the part of the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> that was an exit to medi -- t-to the Mediterranean was given to the Bulgarians, who at the times were allied with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That was one of the reasons that everybug -- bu -- one who could leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavala</span> , left, because we were afraid to stay under the bulger -- Bulgarian government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Because there was an experience from World War I that the Bulgarians had occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and th-the -- 1-it was only torture and -- and -- and fear, and [indecipherable] killing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So everyone who had an experience from before -- not us, before, in ’21 we were not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavala</span> , was telling us what it means to be under the Bulgars. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So we decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  So at that time you actually thought it may have been better to be under the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  We figured at the time we’d much better to be in the Greeks -- in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so we’d be more protected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  And that was not just a fear of what the Bulgarians might do to the Jews, that was the general population’s fear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  No, no that was the fear that the Bulgarians insisted that this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> belonged to them, and we shoul -- we shouldn’t be Greeks, we shouldn’t speak Greek, we shouldn’t have our own associations. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We should turn around and more or less be like a -- like a secret police, and denounce our fr -- our Greek friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That we were not ready to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  And when was this that you made the move?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  We made the move in the end of April 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  And it was possible at that time for you to move around and do these things on your own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Yes, it was just the beginning of the occupation, moving was still free. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I think the restrictions came sometime in June of ’41, but don’t quote me, I’m not sure about the date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , tell me a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> there, was it a mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> ?</span></p>

Just want to continue to find out a little bit more from you about your family’s financial situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">How -- were you well off as a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  We was well off in [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">My father had two associates who were Greek Orthodox, and one of them was very, very influential in the local government. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">As a matter of fact, in 1941, when the Germans were ready to attack <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , my father was able, with his associates, to rent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and transfer all our assets to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> because we were sure that if something happens there, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> will not be touched, will not be bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So our luck was that when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piraeus</span> -- the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> Stiliani -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piraeus</span> was bombed, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was sunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">All our asset were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We had insurance with Lloyd of London, however the insurance was in Greek dol -- mon -- drachmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So after the war, one billion Greek drachma wasn’t even worth an dollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So we lost everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  When was this that this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was taken with all your assets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  In April 1941, when the gi -- Germans attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , they bombed the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piraeus</span> , because it was an expeditionary force of British, who had come to help -- to help the Greeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">As a matter of fact their stand was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thermopylae</span> and then they did [indecipherable] into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> , when they lost Crete, they went back to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So the Germans were bombing all the ports of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at the time, and our luck, which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> had to be sunk there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Is this a very unusual story? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Do you know other families who did anything like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  No, it’s very, very unusual, because at that time to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was more than [indecipherable], it was influence, and you know, having people help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  So this was actually a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> full of money, your money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  This was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with all our assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">In other words, all the merchandise that we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavala</span> , we transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> and we were left without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That’s why it’s said when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , my father had to start from scratch because we were penniless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Do you remember this being a very difficult time?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  I saw the destruction of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and I was part of it in a way, because they gave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> a small place for a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and the people that could afford to do it, had to move the remains of their relatives to the new <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Part of my family contributed into removing the remains of my grandmother from this <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to the new one, and the <span class="DLF">graves</span> at the time was meant to have six people, six remain of people in one <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">My grandmother is still buried on the new <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The only h-help they could give to us, it’s either to hide a Jew, or to take their belongings and hide them, hopefully to give them back to them when they come back, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">That’s the only thing they could do for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  And did you know of situations like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  Yes, I know a situation like that, where quite [indecipherable] precious things were given away to Greek friends, who unfortunately, after the war, they didn’t -- not all of them gave them back to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Most of them had a famous saying; I’m sorry they didn’t kill you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So they were [indecipherable] not anti-Semitics, but they were humans. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Whatever they could loot and keep, they kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Maybe we’re Jews who would have done the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Did you ever i -- did you ever experience anti-Semitism from the Greek population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  No, not even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">As I told you, I still correspond with Greek friends that, as in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> were very good friends, and we keep in touch with their families and with our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION:  Now, while you were still living in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , were you able to continue observing, you know, holidays and did -- wer -- were you able to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> any more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were closed and occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Most of them became <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> of the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We could not, of course, bake matzohs or things like that for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We kept it quiet in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we used to do our prayers, and that’s it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  And what about the Germans, did you have any interactions with the Germans occupying at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  I had interaction with the Germans that were sent to us from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the 150 people I told you before, because they were part of the shupos, and they used to interfere with our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  In what ways?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  So -- and that was usually coming from the German Jews, not from the -- the Germans in charge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  From the German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">You know, it’s a funny thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The Germans sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> six people, only six people. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And these six people recruited the Jewish police, and the 150 people that come th -- came there before, and did the whole job of deporting close to 100,000 people, just with six of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It’s fantastic, the way they were organized.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  Did you know the names of the others at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  No, I’m afraid I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">If I knew them, I don’t remember them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  So now, back to the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">When -- when these began, what else were you seeing? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">What -- what -- were the people immediately around you being taken, or was it different groups of people?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  So do you remember when the people in your section were deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  That must have been sometime before Passover, between April and May, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  What were you hearing and what were -- what was everybody being told as to where these deportations were going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  They were told to bring the money with them, to exchange the money to zlotys because they were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , where <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had decided to establish a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> and were concentrating all the Jews of Europe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And people believed in that because the Chief Rabbi was the first one to disseminate the -- the rumor, and they were going like sheep to the new <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where they go -- were going to have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  Were they told where in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I believed what the Greeks were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I didn’t believe what the Germans were saying, but by Jewish tradition, I couldn’t leave my father and mother, so I had to stay with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  Did you at all discuss with them the idea of escaping?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We didn’t know about the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Don’t misunderstand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We didn’t know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But we knew that where they’re sending them was nothing good.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  So when you saw others around you being deported, and you were not being deported, did you think for awhile that you would never face the deportations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Well, we were told by the Spanish consul that they were making arrangements to take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So we were looking for them, we were given passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We -- part of our money we gave to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish embassy</span> to keep for us, and we were waiting the day that we’ll be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Then it came in July 1943 that we were called -- actually our parents, the heads of families were called to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> named Beth Saul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> with instructions, and instead of instructions, they were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and we were told to follow them and join them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So I took my mother and myself and we went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , called <span class="BUILDING">Baron Hirsch</span> , to join my father.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  I used to speak most of the time Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Ah -- my language was Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Forget that we were Spanish citizens, we were Greeks after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and we deported from Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">We knew Ladino among our families, but outside our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> we used to speak Greek.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Pm not going to answer to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I know about the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , but most of the people -- the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> there were -- were Russian citizen -- occu -- pri -- prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They executed an awful lot of Russians there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="861">QUESTION:  So you weren’t hearing that much, or did you hear from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> about what else was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  We heard from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> what was happening through the Argentineans that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and we never believed it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  I gave you the answer before. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">We were positive we’ll never get alive from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , so we never gave it any other thought, what’s going to be our future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  So, tell me then how it came about when you learned that you were going to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER:  Well, one day a Spanish consul came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and told us that they made arrangements to take us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">He gave us our passports and he said because transportation was very limited, he was going to be in two -- two <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So I happened to be on the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">First about 150 people went ahead of us to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and then the remaining of us went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> about two weeks later.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION:  And do you know -- did you later learn why you were there for that period of time? </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Do you know --
ANSWER:  Yes, we were told from the Spanish government, that they had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">The Germans wanted us to be isolated for a certain amount of time so we couldn’t communicate with the allies and tell them what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> [indecipherable] fortifications and other strategic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We didn’t swallow it, but that’s the answer we were given.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">QUESTION:  So when you were --
ANSWER:  In other words, we were told after the fact, that we were not in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transient camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  But at the time it didn’t feel that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  Of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Who knew what was happening in the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We were completely isolated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  And were there times where you were worried that you might be sent specifically to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">You had heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">We were always worried about what was going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and you knew out -- about the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So what was there to think about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  So when you then heard that you were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , did that give you a certain amount of hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  Not til after we transferred from there and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">We couldn’t believe it and we didn’t believe it til we actually passed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Bo</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> and arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">QUESTION:  What was the journey like? </span><span class="sentence" id="907">How long did it take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  Very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I think it took about two and a half weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And then we waited for about two days at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> in the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> because two our people had died, and the Germans wanted to make sure that we sign affidavits that they didn't kill them, that they were natural deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  Who was transporting you then, at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">ANSWER:  The Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Everything was done by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We -- we sp -- went through the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> all the way down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Bo</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And we signed affidavits before we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">QUESTION:  So each one of you, you had to sign personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">ANSWER:  I think the -- the man in charge is the one who signed, who, being a Jew -- his name was Izrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war, and during the war, the consul of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">He was traveling with us and he is the one who certified that they were not killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">QUESTION:  I -- I just remembered reading that -- that also this Rabbi Koretz was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , were you aware of him being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">We were of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">We were very aware of it and that’s why we hate him much today. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I’m positive he was a collaborator, that’s why he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">His family survived, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He is the only one who died. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And he died from typhoid and maybe from old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  So, during the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , were you with your parents the whole time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">We were with our parents, we were well fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">We had no complaints, except what as I told you before, to the last minute, we didn’t know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">The fear was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">QUESTION:  So, if you could tell me now, what happened next? </span><span class="sentence" id="933">You got to this point where somebody had to sign these affidavits and then you actually entered <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">ANSWER:  When we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , we were under the auspices of joice distri -- Joint Distribution Committee, under the [indecipherable] or whatever it 1s, of Samuel Sakura, who happened to be also the representative of the Portuguese Red Cross in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">We were distributed into <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We were taken bi -- care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">We were, all of us examined to find out if health-wise we were bis- perfect, that nothing was wrong with us, and we were given as a matter of fact, pocket money, so we won’t suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> about six months, and if it wasn’t for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> we wouldn’t be alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We were treated royalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">No complaints at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Now, the reason that we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> is because, as we found out later on, there was an agreement that General Franco will not accept too many Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , there had to be a certain amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So they organized a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , they took us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cadiz</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cadiz</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , we were took into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> , that other time we was liberated from the Germans, and the Americans were occupying <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  Who -- who’s they? </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Who is taking you?</span></p>
