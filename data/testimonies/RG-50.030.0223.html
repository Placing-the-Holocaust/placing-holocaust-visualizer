<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell me about you as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Uh where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Something about your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  In fact I was recently back at the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> when when there was a commemoration of Kristallnacht and my uh and I was invited to give a uh dedicatory speech to the uh uh to to the uh of stone that was left there, an artistic re...re-creation at the place where the uh <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> had stood and they started a monument there, so I went back into that <span class="INT_SPACE">school room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">It was a uh one pers...a one class school room, with where kids from the age of six to sixteen were all housed in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">school room</span> and the teacher there was a master of time engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He was able to keep the everybody occupied and differently uh except for choral singing or something like that during the entire <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I have, I've, I'm a teacher myself and I don't think I would have half the skills to do what he had done in giving us all a fantastically good education. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Uh all the children who went on, later on to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , uh were uh prepared as virtually nobody else and excelled then in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh my activities also centered around a Jewish club which was called Jugendgemeinde. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was headed or instructed or conducted by our cantor, a man by the name of Sisnook (ph) and I've written about him and uh so that was the supplementary education. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I think some of my skills if any as a uh as aan analyst of literature started there because we started sort of with ex...exegesis of the uh of , the and other and Mishna [ph] and the Talmud and explicated it and this this this uh tendency to read closely was really nurtured in that community. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So that was, these are some perimeters under which I grew up and of course 1n in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with my uh Jewish as well as Christian friends, and it seemed before 1933 as if some level of integration had been reached. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Christian friends came to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I to, I to theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We were invited to the same parties together and of course it all came unstuck and viciously in 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Uh in - I'll give, I think I can best illustrate 1t by one example. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I had known one of my friends in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> even before I got to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which starts, of course, started of course even as it does now in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at age ten, and uh uh his name was Heinrich, Heinrich Hennes, and uh he uh when the first nasty things happened in the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> , he be...he uh out of conviction became our stoutest defender. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He would, he would, he would en...he would engage in fisticuffs in order to protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was highly intelligent and then the, he was also of course in the Nazi youth organization as everybody 1n in the class was, and uh finally uh he was taken aside more and more by his youth leader and this youth leader and the propaganda managed to turn him around completely and he became our worst enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He became the attacker. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He became, uh because he was so highly intelligent, he would uh he would shout very hurtful catcalls when one of the Jewish childr....uh we were three boys in this high sch...in this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class, and he would uh interrupt by catcalls. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He became our worst tormenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh he uh from the reports I have received later from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , he became such a fanatic that when the German fortunes turned around in 1n the Soviet in the Soviet Union, in the war there, uh he shot himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And that is, I think while he is an extreme example this type of turnaround 1s, turnabout 1s is really very much significant and and characteristic of those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There were few who either surreptitiously or openly kept contact with us, but we, we became as the years progressed ever more isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">To uh, an incident which has no great significance but which uh just shows uh we were on soccer teams together and then all of a sudden you were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You uh, I was kicked out of an <span class="BUILDING">athletic club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh I uh I I was fairly decent athlete and I had won the requisite number of points to get some sort of medal and that of course was denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">These were small little incidents, but they linger because they're childhood memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Of course they are compared to the horrors that followed, they pale but nonetheless these are memories, and that's also part of that process of growing up an adolescent in the Hitler in the Hitler years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Tell us more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh how did uh the tightening laws, for instance, affect your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Uh of course the Nuremburg laws uh immediately uh ma...we were forced to dismiss immediately the uh uh very nice young lady, young girl who had worked as as the household help of my mother and we had to take a woman uh I think over forty-five because that was a law that only uh women uh supposedly uh safe from the hyperactive Jewish male sexuality uh would be protected, and so she immediately left our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The tightening laws also meant that my father had fewer and fewer customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh he had, he would uh travel uh during the week to various customers in the nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and uh have samples of his uh textiles and then ship them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And more and more and more often there were signs on these, uh on these <span class="DLF">farms</span> - we don't want Jews in here. "</span><span class="sentence" id="37">Juden ist der Eintritt verboten." </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Uh and so there was diminished income. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There were worries. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Uh and uh these were the first signs of a of a major catastrophe coming about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  How did things begin to change for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">When did you decide you knew you wanted to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Or were going to try to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  I think it was the uh atmosphere of hate and persecution and isolation in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of being occasionally accosted when uh in <span class="BUILDING">public places</span> , you know - people would shout after you - this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about sixty-five thousand people, so people knew each other even if only slightly, so you were readily identified as a Jew and uh so uh my brother was beaten up at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh at another time uh there was a uh young man whom we knew from the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and when it was still open to Jews uh we would go swimming there, my brother and I, and uh uh one time uh a young fellow about our age uh started beating us up and if we had really resisted that would have made it worse, and uh as as as a sort of a psychological note, this man's, this young man's name was was Moses. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He was not Jewish and I think uh his aggressiveness stemmed from the fact that at one time people thought this was a Jewish firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They of course immediately changed their name from Moses to Mosel (ph) and uh uh IJ uh later on, getting back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> as a soldier, I found out that he was captured in in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and had a real sense of satisfaction about it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="48">laughter) But these were some of the incidents, the tightening uh at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - things we couldn't do anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">You, there were many <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you couldn't go on vacation any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">These were mild things, but being beaten up at the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> , I I felt it was getting worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My parents as well, and so they uh in in 1936 really was when they made serious efforts to contact our relatives in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> in order to try getting us out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  The relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , uh how had they gotten to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Uh my Uncle Beno (ph), uh my my mother's brother, uh was somewhat of a rebel as a boy and the, my my grandfather whom I loved was also the typical German patriarch, and any sign of rebelliousness was immediately uh was first uh there came stern warnings and when Uncle Beno became, still was not conforming to family rules, they shipped him to another relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was a place (laughter) for for uh disobedient sons and daughters and so he was shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Yes. (</span><span class="sentence" id="56">Laughter)
QUESTION:  So the contact had been made...
ANSWER:  The contact had been made. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It had really never uh there was the obligatory letter of say two letters a year and uh he had gotten to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , had uh learned how to be a baker, and uh until the Depression had a steady job at at one of the uh <span class="BUILDING">bread factories</span> , uh small uh <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood bakeries</span> , and uh then with the Depression he lost his job, and uh so he, however, had a good rapport with the union leaders so they sent him on various temporary jobs when somebody was sick or vacation or there was a special uh special demand for bakery goods, he was he was sent and so he would sometimes work three, four day...uh days and nights on end and then there would be uh absolutely no employment for for a month, but he he was able to get his family through the worst times, but he certainly was in no way financially able uh to back up an affidavit even though he made out one. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And uh that uh came after I had gone on a bicycle trip with a Jewish group in 1937, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my parents told me uh two affidavits are waiting for you - one from my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and one by a children's organization also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , both of them in in fact worthless as far as the stipulations of the American government were concerned which wants to make sure by financial backing that the immigrant would not become a public charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So uh the uh uh two affidavits were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The children's affidavit worthless - I was fifteen at the time, hence I was not a child and my uncle had no financial backing whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So, but I didn't know that these affidavits were really insignificant as far as the American government was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  So what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  I (cough) I was uh able to secure a date from the American consul in very rapid order. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Uh I had come back from this bicycle trip, I now remember, in about August, and had my uh and two months later had already a date in October with the American consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> which uh was, the distance was not very great and I was able to get a ride with a uh another family ready to immigrate and we all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh the next day I presented myself at at the American consul's office. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was an encounter that lasted fifteen minutes and obviously changed my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh the American official - I shall never forget his name because uh uh indeed it was the most important fifteen minute encounter of my life - his name was Malcolm C. Burk (ph) and uh he asked absolutely inane questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh in he was it it was apparent that he wanted to have me succeed in getting getting his uh getting the visa and so he asked me questions like uh I guess to ascertain my sanity (laughter) how much is uh is uh 48 and 52. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh I'm not good at numbers but that one I was up to. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">In fifteen minutes I had I had his stamp on on my uh identification papers and uh never really wondered...I I thought that was the way routinely matters went. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And uh in November of that year I uh was uh informed by a Jewish organization that they had a group of children uh that was going over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there was an escort, a woman...uh even right now under your questions, Linda, my memory 1s jogged--uh Mrs. Epstein (ph) and uh she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> going...taking us over and then coming back, having having fulfilled her mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I uh disembarked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Uh a far-flung relative picked me up, then turned me over to the Children's Committee the next day and uh they determined that my English was good enough uh that I could be sent on that long train trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and so I had arrived in in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Tell us what you did in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in those first years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">IT I guess I'll I'll put myself on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> once more, because there was an interruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I had to change <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , was picked up by a member of that committee and uh the this very nice woman said she could give me a short overview of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> uh in two hours until my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> was due. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">She took me in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the only thing that I remembered today of course is some of the <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> I had never seen before but also the absolute mad scene at <span class="BUILDING">Maxwell Market</span> where she took me and it's...I guess one of my first impressions of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> uh was was this <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and and uh the trading and and the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> [ph] all that went with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Uh then I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , was picked up - my relatives, picked up by my relatives, taken uh to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and five days later I was in an <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Uh a very good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It was considered at that time, Southern (ph) High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> was considered to be on a par with some of the <span class="BUILDING">eastern prep schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Uh it uh I must say the education I had gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> both in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and and in a one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> uh <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was really geared me for what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I graduated within two years in June '39 and that is when I uh it was obvious that my uncle could not support me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I started working in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">lunch room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh then a teacher of uh a Jewish teacher took an interest in me, even though I had never taken a class with her, and she introduced me to the owner of a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> chain - uh no, of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or the fanciest <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , the Chase, and I became a bus boy there uh being trained first as a water boy and uh then in fact uh throughout my uh college career until I had my Master's I worked as a busboy and waiter in various <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , so that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Uh in, I graduated in '39, worked for one year to have a bit of a financial backing and then started on a part-time basis at <span class="BUILDING">St. Louis University</span> , uh finished my uh my uh lower division courses by sort of uh the, II got myself a job at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> closest to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , one block away - the Melbourne (ph) Hotel which in fact today is a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and uh sometimes ran from the one to the other uh coming to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> in my bus boy uniform and uh that's uh what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then of course came the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  How did you keep in touch with your parents, or did you keep in touch with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Yes, by letters of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh and uh in fact the last one I got we were desperately trying to help, finding people to give an affidavit to uh a whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It uh there's there's something that I I guess I still regret because uh I uh didn't have much money so I hitchhiked all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> going to movies that I wanted to see or to the uh <span class="DLF">Botanical Gardens</span> or various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and one time I was picked up by a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He said, I have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I I can do this, and I, he he said but I must tell you, your the lawyers who will draw up this may uh uh may disdain my profession and not do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I'm a gambler. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And he was a wonderful man, and he said I'll go down with you to this lawyer and this lawyer, picked by the St. Louis Jewish community to help people like me uh was too short-sighted to see that all some consuls wanted was a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He said I cannot accept your affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You are not in the kind of profession that the government will accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It would have been, it would have been an easy thing to simply make out the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Had they failed, so be it, but he was he he was so conventional and so hide-bound that he refused this man's uh bona fide_ and it was this is one of the things that sometimes haunts me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Uh so I had my, the last letter I got from my parents was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I don't know how it, whether that is customary or was still possible at the first uh at the in the first stages of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> to write communications from there, but at any rate a letter reached me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> in which of course it was a very guarded letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I realized how bad things were but uh that was the last time I heard of them and uh, well while I have no absolute proof, the presumption is of course they died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They were murdered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Tell me about you when the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Uh I tried enlisting and at that time they were not uh enli...uh they did not accept uh non- native Americans uh for uh for the Army or Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I was ultimately drafted in uh in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh at first was sent to a uh a medical administrative training camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Barkley</span> , Texas. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Had my basic there and then was plucked out one day by special orders to join the Military Intelligence training camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> , Maryland. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Uh most of us were of course because of our linguistic skills, having had college background and the like and uh so I graduated from the eighth class of Military Intelligence Training Camp - it's not too far here from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I visited 1t again, and uh then was, they put together teams for of interrogators. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh after some uh additional training and uh being stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we joined Ist U.S. Army, then readying itself for the uh invasion, and their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bristol</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Then uh on D-Day we of course were mar...uh we went to the Marshall (ph) area which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , got on the LSD's and uh took part in the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was uh it was my first time, even though we had of course had mock interrogations back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh and trained, and be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...been trained in all sorts of things from German army organization to uh terrain intelligence - it was my first real interrogation with tough Nazis on the beaches of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And uh it was uh an experience that I've written about uh and I think what turned uh turned me uh into a uh removed all my sense of inferiority as an interrogator was that was my fourth or fifth interrogation when an artillery shell came over the uh <span class="BUILDING">interrogation tents</span> and uh we, both the prisoner and I, hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and uh he uh showed far greater fright than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And then everything went smoothly and I was able to extract interrogation from beginning in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> to the end of until V-E Day and uh in fact uh I, my reports uh apparently were well-received. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I I got the Bronze Star uh from General Hodges towards the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Tell us about some of these interrogations. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I know some of them have stuck in your mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Uh I I think uh most of our responsibility was of course extracting tactical and strategic in..information and uh some of it was very easy because the uh prisoners didn't realize that uh what they were giving away or we bluffed that we already knew uh or we uh tried to uh uh create the impression that a buddy already had told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh that was, that was fairly easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Some of them, some of the information uh was so uh obvious what we were after and so threatening to the prisoner that it, that we really had to use some very tough psychological warfa...uh uh what we had learned as psychological warfare and really put psychological pressures on the prisoners, and uh most of the time that worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">As uh as a rather neglected but uh <span class="DLF">byline</span> we told to ferret out war criminals and uh those uh guilty of uh genocide and and so forth and uh the first inklings we got of what really had happened were when we did extract such information from prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Uh we would get a a soldier...a German soldiers, not high in rank, about our age and uh as you bored in your interrogation, he would admit that at one time he had been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard, particularly a guard in the early stages of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And uh uh they uh what what struck us at that time was the absolute inability to see the enormity of what they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh I remember one prisoner and in fact I took his confession, in fact have uh have it still, uh where he said uh that he had been a guard at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg concentration camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and that he had frequently volunteered for execution uh uh squads and I asked him, well why did you volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He said well, if I hadn't done it they would have gotten somebody else, and one of the bonuses if you volunteered for an execution sq...squad was that you got a pass, an additional pass to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and you know, he said, uh very conversationally almost, you know, at that time they still had all the <span class="BUILDING">concert halls</span> open and I loved getting to these <span class="BUILDING">concert halls</span> and hearing the concerts there, and so I volunteered for the execution squads. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He was particularly fond of Beethoven and Mozart. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So these were the first uh interrogations were...1t came about that we uh ferreted out some of the minor, small- fry criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The first uh really significant war criminal or let us say against humanity was a uh a man who who we uncovered in an absolute absurd way - it was not our skill but uh a combination of circumstances that brought about his unmasking. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Uh my we uh I I have to give you a bit of background - that day, it was a, it was the day of Roosevelt's death and we were very upset and uh so uh uh one of the MP's brought in that day a prisoner, a young fellow, and uh he said this this fellow has a picture of Himmler autographed tn his uh in his possession and so uh Freddie, my friend Fred Howard and I uh saw that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were angry and so we took the picture away from the prisoner who said that he was a nephew of Heinrich Himmler and so we took the picture and uh we cut, cut, cut it out, the photograph and put a rope around his neck and hung it on a goose-neck lamp that was 1n our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">interrogation camp</span> , hanging him in effigy. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Later that day, very late at night, Freddie ushered in a routine prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He was, had just been captured, a uh Dr. Schuebbe (ph) from Westphalia, and uh this is, this man seemed disoriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">One of our prisoner trustees immediately caught on - he said drugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And so uh uh this man was under the illusion, seeing the picture of Himmler and we were interrogating in short sleeves - it was, you know, very informal and we were not in uniform - and uh so he had the delusion that he was at a <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , with the picture of Himmler, of course, prominently displayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he said, oh, I'm glad to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I belong to you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And so uh Freddie caught on uh this delusion and he said well, we know who we are - who the hell are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And so uh he uh under the guise of try...of having him prove his credentials, drew everything out of him, including the fact that he had personally killed upward of twenty thousand people in in Po...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Uh you know, in the early stages of mass extermination, they used morphine injections, M Preparat, as he called it, and he had gotten addicted himself, so uh he was shipped out and that's how he landed in our uh in our prisoner of war enclosure, and he retold in precise medical detail - uh I even remember the words - uh how a prisoner died. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">You know, he said, oh well, we uh injected them with the uh "M" Preparation, morphine, and then he, after a while a certain euphoria was uh present, 1s, is a state of mind in the prisoner, then - and sort of said it exetentiously (ph) tallis, very medical, and we were uh uh, Freddie, I I uh was putting all this down and then uh he uh uh I I made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I came, uh it was late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I wanted a cup of coffee and Freddie had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I came in and I was dressed in a Russian uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It was one of the tricks we used tn order to extract uh information from the German prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They uh, I was supposed to be a Russian liaison officer who would take recalcitrant prisoners uh and and ship them off to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was a very effective dig...disguise and uh very effective in putting psychological pressure on prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I walked in and that startled him and uh Freddie, of course, caught the drift and immediately pretended throwing me out, that I was a uh a prisoner who was doing menial service and had just wandered in. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That gave him pause and then he made a second mistake and that was the uh that he gave him coffee uh in this long interrogation and uh then uh he came out of the morphine, and he retracted everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">In the next couple of days we did really work hard to break him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We took no-sleep tablets and it was just the routine type of interrogation that you sometimes see on police procedural detective stories - just hammering away again and again and again and by that time he was so exhausted as were we that he once more uh gave us the whole information. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Uh the uh the in the first week of May issue of Time magazine carried the story and so did - we had in the meanwhile uh conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> as you'll recall, and <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> became one of the powerful uh uh radio communication networks for the Allied forces and <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> broadcast verbatim - we took the uh interrogation down verbatim - uh broadcast that both in English and German, broadcast that all over for about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It was probably my biggest case and uh it was uh a pure accident, so you can imagine had it not been for all these circumstances working together, he would have slipped right by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And probably be living a short uh living a long life in practicing medicine someplace in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rural town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westphalia</span> or elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Uh he was executed by the Czechoslovakians later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Uh he was turned over to them because he, many Czechs had been killed by him, so uh I could put that into medical terms but shan't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Will you tell us about some of the other prisoners whom you captured?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Uh we we had one who was very high in the medical profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You know, the uh people the doctors without humanity which was of the titles of the books about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I told you about some of the minor war criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Uh the uh one of the cases that stick...sticks in my mind but is really less relevant for Holocaust except for possibly uh the uh stupidity and arrogance of some of our, of our officers, uh not our officers but of the uh...our officers, most of them were very excellent interrogators. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Uh uh occasionally uh they were less adapt and they had to call in a certain enlisted man. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh this was true of a case of Colonel Fundeheider (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He uh was a professor of law, had become a leader of parachute troops and during the Battle of the Bulge uh had been ordered to take a paratroop troop uh to fight against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They were dropped at the wrong at the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> and quickly taken prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Uh I uh I uh was ultimately selected to interrogate him, and for that you put on higher insignia in order to be on a par with your German prisoner, and uh so I interrogated Colonel Fundeheider and uh he had had part of his law education under a Rockefeller grant in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and he started telling me that and I paid no attention and then he said, of course I can't tell you nothing but my name and rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I said, oh, I wouldn't expect a high-ranking officer like you to tell me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Besides, you did such an inept, stupid, dumb uh uh uh dumb attack with your parachute troops, dropping them off at the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> - uh we really don't want to know anything about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He he pulled himself up 1n his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and started shouting at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He said, how can you say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That's wasn't my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">That was the Air Force's fault, and I said, "Oh, we heard from your prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You were you were completely out of it even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when you trained these troops," and in in defending himself, (laughter) how, what a great field commander he had been, he told me absolutely everything - how the troops were trained, what was their special mission, uh every detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I egged him on - uh time after time, uh and I said well, maybe it wasn't quite so bad, but didn't you do this and then he would again explain this, and at the end of the interrogation, I said uh, Colonel, uh uh I uh really I I I honor your uh silence and uh I know you can't tell me anything and sent him off. (</span><span class="sentence" id="177">Laughter) It was one of the funniest uh interrogations I I had uh during the entire war uh and it was it's memorable. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He ended up then as a law professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wuerzburg</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I never looked him up of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Before we move on, do you have any other interrogations of people who were either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or who were comm...and/or who had committed war crimes that stick in your memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Uh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They were uh, they were all this these kinds of small-fry, people who had been guards uh and who really uh I, in the...I can say in the aggregate, I uh that uh they were absolutely negligible as persons, but in the aggregate, they really had no conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They they realized, they had no idea really what they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Uh as a matter of fact, under your prodding, I do remember one case - he was a Romanian who had volunteered for the SS, or had been drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I can't recall that for sure, but uh under intense interrogation, he told us that he had sort of conducted a personal vendetta against a family in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , had showed up at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and simply shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Uh uh and so uh if 1f memories sort of come back and uh he uh said while I went into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Frankels (ph), I think that was their name, and uh simply, I I wanted some of the stuff in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> uh and he simply shot them right there on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And that of course uh js a uh 1s a story that uh still remains. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Uh it uh among those whom we liberated uh one of the more memorable scenes was uh and probably not very well known - uh the Germans had not, had put into <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> but not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> some of the veterans of the Spanish Republican Army, and these uh uh men uh whom Spanish officers we had liberated for the, they had been asked to dig defenses in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but they had earlier been on the <span class="REGION">Channel Islands</span> , which the Germans had taken over and built fortifications there. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So uh I uh since I had uh studied Spanish in in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , in - no, not in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> - I was asked to interrogate them, and so I uh they were of course not just uh re...uh reluctant witnesses but they were just so overly willing to give uh everything away and and tell what the fortifications were, and uh the one in fact was an engineer and drew me a very detailed and sophisticated map of all the fortifications on the <span class="REGION">Channel Islands</span> that he had helped build. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And uh if we had ever invaded the <span class="REGION">Channel Islands</span> , we would have (laughter) had the most detailed situation map that you could have imagined. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But of course that never materialized, but that was, is another memorable uh interrogation because of course the higher <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> saw it and uh that was the kind of detail that was very rare, even though it proved outwardly to be utterly useless. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Uh but that is, those are some of the interrogations that I recall, except one of curious coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">This was at the uh right after the uh invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We pushed forward into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we had virtually surrounded the uh German uh troops uh between the two cities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falaise</span> (ph) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Argentan</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And uh there was one <span class="DLF">gap</span> - uh there's a new book, just came out - it's being reviewed and this book uh uh on World War II says the <span class="DLF">gap</span> , had Montgomery acted faster would have been closed and the war might have stopped right then and there or at least in the war in the west, and uh had we uh were unable to close it but we took thousands of prisoners near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falaise</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Argentan</span> and so we had to do uh we had to do uh work very quickly with the prisoners and had no time except pick out some that by uh vir...by the testimony of their of their paybooks were important. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So uh, I flipped through stacks upon stacks of paybooks uh which were in, were very detailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The, not like our identification papers which gave virtually nothing away, but their's gave last leave, and I flipped through and I find a paybook, Gunther H., from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hildesheim</span> , a lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And I thought this this can't be a coincidence...it can't be uh a strange...this must be the Gunther H. whom I went went to the same <span class="BUILDING">athletic club</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So I waited till 1t was pitch dark that night, and interrogated him in darkness, of course using his home background uh to extract information and he was peering through the darkness because it was so obvious that I uh knew a heck of a lot about him, and at the end of it he said, uh how do you know so much about me, and I said well, I had also seen I was prepared for that question, that he had earned a high decoration and I said, well we in intelligence keep book on all those who are highly decorated uh officers in the German army, and then sent him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It was uh this this kind of war coincidence--I've written about this because uh he might still be alive for all I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It's exactly my age and uh a rather unprepossessing, uninteresting fellow when I was in the Turnverein--Athletic Club--Eintracht in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hildesheim</span> with him uh and he had developed into apparently a quite a warrior because uh that decoration wasn't given away uh to just anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Did he give you valuable information?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I II have to be honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It, since we had this, you know, uh surrounded Argentan and Falaise and I had not picked him for uh his potential as an informant but simply because I was interested whether it was the same fellow and uh just to see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Uh he he was, it was not productive, but it was a curious coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Let's move on a bit...
ANSWER:  Surely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  ...unless you have other stories of interrogations that you want to add.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  If something occurs I'll I'll insert them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Uh, let's start moving across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and moving across Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Uh at what point did you start encountering your first prisoners of uh, that is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims and indeed your first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Uh, the uh guards were sort of strewn across our <span class="DLF">path</span> as we advanced into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and more and more of these uh small-fry prisoners who had been guards and who told us something of the horrors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schuebbe</span> , that came right after we crossed over uh across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I think it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Andernach</span> that we uh our prisoner of war camp was when we encountered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schuebbe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh then at the end of the war uh when uh we had uh linked, uh almost linked with the Russians, uh were in that sector going through Hesse-we were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersfeld</span> and then we came upon the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It, uh we were not among the fir...the troops who came there the first day and I heard from some of them uh there uh utter horror and uh completely uh overwhelmed by by the sights. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We came one day later and yet uh not much had changed because we could not, there was no way of evacuating uh the prisoners to a to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We, of course, sent in physicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We sent in food, clothing and the like and uh uh what uh the way these faces looked - I don't mean simply emaciated as you see, but some pie...one person whose jaw was hanging virtually loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">A tall man, emaciated with a loose-hanging jaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I mean you you - these are details that stick in your head and in your mind and you uh you don't get over that very easily, and uh uh I I talked to some of them and uh they uh it 1t was, you know, they embraced you uh and you you felt why do I, I'm not a liberator. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You know, I I wasn't in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when it was liberated but there was this uh curious uh immediate heart-to-heart meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Uh and one of the...we were, the prisoners of war contingent was there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> but so was our uh MP outfit, a platoon of MP's that had served virtually from the very beginning, had accompanied all us all through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uh and we had of course worked very closely with each other because when you uh interrogated you needed the safety of of the prisoners uh the the guards and you told them what you were doing and there was a real wonderful working relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The uh in charge of uh, nominally in charge was a captain, but the real disciplinarian of that MP company was a Master Sergeant Hadley from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steubenville</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And uh uh I uh had, I was of the same rank for much of the time and uh so we had struck up a real friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I have, he was the prototype of the tough, read...and ready to fight U.S. Sergeant and an MP besides. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">You know, they have additional uh set of calluses all over their body. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And uh uh Sergeant Hadley, I, we didn't arrive at the same time, and uh I was looking around - I I I guess the uh emotions were so overwhelming that I looked for some sign uh maybe that's mental cowardice, that I was looking for some sign of something normal, so I looked for buddies uh who had come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with us, and I saw one who had sort of cradled his eyes with his arm like this, and uh I I recognized him immediately - it it was Sergeant Hadley, and he was bawling like a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Uh it 1t was it was getting to all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And uh in in my case that was all the more understandable, because, you know, it was a very personal crusade, the war, and a very personal uh involvement with my parents and my brother and my sister over there, and uh I didn't know their fate at that time but I could surmise and but this, for generations we had talked about our uh heritage and the like, at one time this Sergeant Hadley and I, and he was for generations in in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> and uh his family and but and he was not personally involved but he just uh uh broke down completely and I I was told by other members of uh who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> at various times that the same thing had happened to uh General Eisenhower when he came there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  I want to pause and change tapes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Uh, we had hung up uh these uh big containers of water and prisoners were clustering around them because they of course didn't have even an abundance of water during the time of captivity. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And uh uh then we had set up uh a uh aa uh <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where we had, were dispensing food. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And uh our physicians who were treating some of the worst cases uh had came to uh came to the <span class="DLF">chow line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We had given them uh little containers where they, you know, uh field kits and uh what the physicians were fighting the prisoners was that they took very small portions at first uh and I remember one scene where a medical officer, a captain whom I had seen because at one time I also had to interrogate prisoners in the <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> where they were being treated, and uh I had seen him before and met him there again at uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and I had seen him at his, in the <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> and he was one of those spit-and- polish officers, despite the fact that he was a physician, but he was running that <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I I I think I only had one or two encounters with him before and there he was, again a a person who in the months between the invasion and uh and uh the end of the war had been toughened by combat, and there he was standing with a a with an emaciated - well, they were all emaciated - with a man who who had who was ready to eat ravenously and and he put his arm around him, and the, he was in a spit-and-polish uniform and the prisoner was dirty as they were all, and he put his arm around him and he he said to him, I heard him...he said, take a little now. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We will take you back later, but to eat a lot now is very dangerous for you, and so he led him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Very gently. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Uh what uh uh what also impressed me 1s that uh the prisoners were not able to shed, to I I think deep down <span class="NPIP">inside</span> they weren't all that sure that a new, that all that was behind them, and so they would still uh walk to that <span class="DLF">chow line</span> in somewhat of a make-shift formation. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was pitiful because they were free now, but they would still gather as though there was an SS uh SS guard hounding them. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And uh uh they uh didn't walk erect uh and they uh were, there were some who uh came to attention when an American officer came, as though there was, you know, it was apparently at that moment not quite comprehensible that they they were free, they were there, that the the oppression and the horror had ended, and this was not Day |. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">This was Day 2 uh and it still in some, they were uh so shaken and and so uh uh still enwrapped in in the environment that had been their lot for so for so long a time that they could not shed the uh image of what or or the experience that had lain before. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Uh I walked around uh once uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There was, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">There was a small cr...sort of not even a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span> , sort of a uh a little bit of a puddle running through uh through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and one prisoner was getting ready to stoop down to uh drink this uh muddy water which he obviously had done before, and so uh not I but somebody else just sort of put his hand under his elbow and said uh, over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You know, he couldn't speak the, it was it was I guess one of our MP's who who uh uh couldn't speak German uh and just pointed to the water containers and then then the man uh who had already stooped down came up again and walked over to the water container, so the, it it you are what what to summarize it, it was almost as if you had to unlearn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">These are some of the memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Uh I I must admit that we didn't stay long. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It 1t was, uh II think some uh some threw up at that sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I didn't, but uh I was very queasy and uh we we left with our our captain, Captain Kahn (ph) uh had had gathered us and said back to the, back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , and we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Before you left, did you go into any of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Did you see any of the living conditions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I I I just, I I I must say I walked around the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> but I did not go into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> because uh most of most of the prisoners were not in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They had come out, I guess to greet every more ever fresh visitors because once that first uh wave of visitors was over uh others came and they were, they showed the same gratefulness again and again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">As we were leaving, another uh troop - I don't know who they were, American troop - came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> just to see it, and uh uh again the same scene of coming to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and greeting the Americans and uh and no - I did not go in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  And did you at any point see any of the <span class="DLF">burial areas</span> that took place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Uh as you know, they were mass burials. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They were uh simply uh taken and uh as I recall, uh we had, they uh - oh yeah, the the commander who was met, who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> the first day had gotten some of the local villagers uh to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they were helping in the burial detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And there were <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> that I think the uh uh I wasn't there when they were dug. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">They were there and uh it was obvious that some of the people who were still walking would not make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Oh, I I did talk to one of, to that same physician whom I knew slightly - I said Captain, what are the chances here of survival of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And he said, well I can't give you statistics or anything like that, but a good many won't make it, even now that we have the medic...the medicine here. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Uh he said uh my commanding officer has asked for more medicine and uh we'll have it but I am afraid it'll be too late, so I'm uh by his testimony uh many more than already were were dead would join them before we could do a darn thing for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to add about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  One of the things that uh uh struck me, as I said I wasn't in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was so muddy, you know, with all the people walking around, and these these, many didn't have shoes and so the the mud and the grime was all the way - this seems a silly thing to remember because, you know, but you know as a soldier you are trained to be always, you know, completely neat even even (laughter) if you are going to battle or whatever and and uh I I was not a front-line soldier but even those uh had, the first thing they were asked is to and it struck me at the incredible filth and dirt and each time they put their foot down, that water from that mud would once more uh send sprinkles up on to on to their pajama uniforms and to their legs and uh uh this is an image that also you see as they were sort of stomping around the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">campsite</span> - it's a little detail but it it's again something that sticks with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ...
ANSWER:  I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and uh then uh we sort of carried on for a short while and in those uh couple of days after the, after V-E day uh where we all celebrated of course, uh our captain said well, we haven't had any orders not to interrogate any more. (</span><span class="sentence" id="277">laughter) So uh curiously enough, even though the war was over, and at this time uh we did concentrate more on those people who had been guards and the like, and we were even asked by uh some of the people already designated to be in military government, to see whether we couldn't come up what were called black and white lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">In short, uh trying to interrogate people who had been particularly helpful and had left, had led lives of some virtue during the Nazi period and some of the uh uh some of the villains. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We turned these lists over to uh military government later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I don't think much happened with them, or that they were taken very seriously but that we did and perhaps they should have been taken more seriously, because our our job was done, and we could only pass on. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Uh one of the stories that remains, and that happened earlier while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> - it was the interrogation of my friend, he's still a friend of mine - these friendships have lasted from these uh compacted years of three years of interr...or two years of interrogation, uh the most intensive uh intense days of our lives really, cause we had a mission, and Carley (ph) had the most curious case. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He wrote about it later on for commentary, but I know some of the details because I saw part of it, and that was the case of the Jewish SS girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Uh and I uh I think it it's uh it's so again uh so convoluted that and the coincidences that this that this came to our attention and that we uh, that this girl got to that stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">She was a Belgian girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and her parents, after the uh Germans had taken uh <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , managed to flee to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Uh uh they got uh they got as far as the uh city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> (ph) and here the uh Catholic bishop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> uh took it upon himself to save some of the Jewish children, and what he did is he placed them with Catholic French families, cause they all spoke French being from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and he placed some of these Belgium children with uh uh with uh Catholic families and then uh the Germans of course came as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> and they started first to deport Jews, and uh she still saw, by her testimony uh she saw her parents being rounded up on one of set of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that uh gathered in the uh in the uh city hall square of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Uh then the Germans started recruiting French laborers to work in German armament industries and one day she, of course taken as a Catholic girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monalbon</span> , was also told to report for duty in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and was shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LUNA-Werke</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , and she was, as she told us, she was so scared that she performed at with greater eagerness than even the, well certainly with greater eagerness than the other forced laborers who were of course also asked to work at top performance, and so she came to the attention to uh one woman foreman. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She said wow, this woman, she really puts her heart into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We're going to make her an SS auxiliary. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And she had, there was no way she could protest this, and uh so she uh, we found her together with another SS auxiliary woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Uh we uh took her prisoner in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in I beg your pardon, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , uh on the German, near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> and when she, when Carley was interrogating her, she said, uh I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And he, he he, of course, you know, with with all the skepticism that we had heard all, every kind of story of exculpation and every kind of story of phoniness, you know that was our job and uh and Carley said, you are what? </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh and uh then she explained what I have just told you, and Carley still didn't uh believe a word of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He said it's a very clever uh clever way, and then he called over - we had uh a, we had a young Belgium working with our CIC detachment, and he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , so Carley called him in and said come on here, and of course the uh Belgian, Jacques, didn't believe it either, so uh he uh they both were sort of kidding and uh so uh she he uh asked her, at at this point I I joined them, uh and he asked her uh - OK, you you you're from, you're a Jewish girl from uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Uh OK, name some of the uh name some of the suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They started off like that, and then she just rattles them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And uh then he said, where's the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">She knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Then he asked her about uh some of the Jewish rituals. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Absolutely solid. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And uh then uh he said what was your name in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And it turned out that he knew her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So the story was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Not a good friend or anything like that...
QUESTION:  Quite a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  What is, what is Carley's full name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Carley Fr , and uh he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and uh we sometimes talk about these days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  What happened to the girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  We sent her off with the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> because we really didn't want to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Did she tell you any of the things that she had done as an SS auxiliary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Apparently she was most of the time a uh forced laborer and uh as the SS auxiliaries, you know, they were used in uh as clerical help. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I I don't think she ever did anything that would uh truly be war criminal or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Uh but I don't, I don't know that and I I think once we had identified her uh it it went so deep that we, that we we really didn't want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And that's how Carley's story, if you ask him, would end. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We never know what happened to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Are there other stories you want to share with us of during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  I, of the wartime period - uh I, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">II think I I've really uh come up with with those where my, where where memory speaks and uh where I uh, which which stick out. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh much of it is is lost wartime stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And uh they are, perhaps in another context might become interesting, but by and large, I I've seen uh many of the people again with whom I served, many of them Jewish, many of them sharing or having shared the same experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Uh and uh curiously enough, it, whenever we do meet -as happened only day before yesterday while I was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Massachusetts</span> , and somebody who was in the same unit with me for a while, Professor Henry Lee, and I shared some of our memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">That's inevitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But I I think uh these are some of the more impress...memories that impress me today in looking back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Tell us what happened then when you came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Uh I uh [had the, my my ambition was uh to become a journalist, and one of my uh officers in Military Intelligence had been uh Sheppard Stone (ph) who was on the staff of the New York Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He had given me a very warm recommendation uh to the Managing Editor, and uh so on the strength of that I left St. Louis, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and uh started working in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , introduced myself to the Managing Editor who on the strength of this letter saw me not once but several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Couldn't find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> for me because they were uh double- platooned so to speak because many of their correspondents were coming back and had a claim on their old jobs and then those who had done wartime service also had uh still had their jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">There was no uh uh opportunity to to start at the New York Times then, so I decided to keep on working uh as a waiter and start <span class="BUILDING">college</span> again, and I uh uh started, in uh '46, I started at Hofstra (ph) University, then <span class="BUILDING">Hofstra College</span> , graduated in '48, uh went on for graduate work at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> uh and uh then uh got my first job uh and ultimately became both an administrator - I was, I wrote uh on on the field of Germanistics (ph), and here 1s where really the experiences where I had to make a personal decision, and it was sort of a watershed and I was at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Uh I could, uh could have entered of course a variety of <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I found to my satisfaction and that of my professors that I had some gifts for German literature and for German cultural history, and so they encouraged me to stay with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I had really looked at it as as a transit to comparative literature, but they offered me an assistantship and an instructorship uh and so I stuck in Germanistics and then uh the existential question came - uh if you, I said to myself, if you stay in German studies, you obviously will have to deal with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And uh so I asked myself whether that, whether I could do it, and I uh came to the recognition that I indeed had a gift and to deny it or to uh let it lie fallow would be an act of self-amputation, very much like the one they were going to inflict on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was doing the work of enemy, so uh I decided to stay in German and this came somewhat later and I also thought that if I could uh analyze literature and if I could uh write about German literature, I could certainly do that work for those who had been exiled from from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the Nazi period, and I became in somewhat of a scholar of uh exile literature and of those who and the writings of writers who uh perished in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and I've written on that uh and uh last last year a book called "Literature...", or in German, Literatur in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exil</span> , which was published in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I think looking back, I've made the right decision, because uh I've lent, lent voice to some writers who possibly without me might be forgotten or not remembered very often, so I have uh in a way uh kept their memory and the memory of their writings alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  One cannot ask more than that perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  I hope so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  I suppose the kind of work you do here in keeping the memory of of those of the Holocaust alive touches very closely on my work as well, and uh so I have frequently interviewed, of course from a literary and historical perspective, uh those who uh either survived, for example H. D. Adler (ph) who survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and has written a book about it - I've interviewed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I've uh interviewed some people who were hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> uh and are writers today. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I've interviewed many of the exiles who came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so I I think uh in a way this kind of oral history, whether yours or mine, uh may help to resuscitate some people from being forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Thank you, Linda. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview </span>
