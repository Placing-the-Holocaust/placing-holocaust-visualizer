My father was the youngest of six children. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Uh, his father was a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">They were of more ethnic German background in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh, my father went to <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My mother went to <span class="BUILDING">Russian schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh, my parents always spoke Russian to each. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My mother's father was a painter and a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And uh died when he...when she was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh, some of his paintings were so outstanding that uh... My mother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always full of...my mother grew up in <span class="BUILDING">household</span> full of paintings, and some of his paintings were so outstanding that she even was asked once to donate two of the paintings to the <span class="BUILDING">Louvre</span> , but... In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But uh naturally, she only had a few of them and kept them with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And she still has them. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh, my parents met as teenagers, because uh...their older siblings (laughter) were married...got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My mother's older sister got...was married to my father's older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Both my parents had magnificent voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh, my father was a baritone. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother uh...went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to study at the <span class="BUILDING">Conservatory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh, she was known there as the girl with the golden voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh, their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liep_ja</span> , which in Russian is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liyepaya</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I... They both when to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as poor students. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My father went first. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He uh registered both in <span class="BUILDING">engineering school</span> and at the <span class="BUILDING">Hochschule fir Musik</span> , although he first started at the <span class="BUILDING">Hochschule fur Musik</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My mother followed later. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They were married in 1928 in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , with both families present; and then they went back to study in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh, one day my father sang...had the opportunity the audition for the composer Mascagni, who urged him to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> with his beautiful voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But he had no money, and he was on full scholarship in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And so Mascagni said, "____ Italia." </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My father felt he had...had no choice but stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Uh, my mother finished the <span class="BUILDING">Conservatory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ber</span> ...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ; and studied at the <span class="BUILDING">Conservatory</span> there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh, shortly after they were married, my father got a job offer to sing at the Breslau [NB: Wroclaw] Opera Company. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He took a stage name, Yasha Lenssen. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Uh, his real name is Jacob...Jacob Levinsons. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My mother is Pauline Levine. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh, he was asked to sing the leading roles in 19 operas--the baritone roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But soon after, they found out that uh his stage name, Lenssen, really was Levinsons--which, of course, he was not about to hide anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh, they decided to cancel his contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">This was in the early '30s in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So my father, having completed some of his university studies at that time, decided to go into business in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And his father helped him out by uh introducing him to someone who needed a contact in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And so my father became a representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for a business firm abroad, and was quite successful at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And they started uh...from being very poor students and living in very, very cramped one-room (laughing) without any money at all, both on scholarships, to being able to set themselves up in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My father did quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh, I was born at that time--as I said, in 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And when I was about uh 6 months old, my parents decided that I should have a photograph taken of me; and my mother took me to a photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">One of the best in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he did...he made a very beautiful picture--which my parents thought, at least, was a very beautiful picture-- which my parents had framed and put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> that my father gave my mother as a present when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And there was this picture on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">One day, the lady who came to clean...help my mother clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , Frau Klauke, said to my mother, "You know, I saw Hessy on a magazine cover in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And my mother thought surely she must be mistaken, that there are many babies that look alike, and just told her, "Well, that couldn't be [the] case." </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Uh, the lady insisted; and she says, "No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It's definitely Hessy. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It's this picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And...and just give me some money, and I'll get you the magazine." </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And so my mother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And sure enough, this lady came back with a magazine, the front cover which said, "Sonne ins Haus"--which in German means, "the Sun in the <span class="BUILDING">Home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And there was the picture on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> reproduced on the front cover of this magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">This magazine was published out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , and very definitely one of the few magazines allowed to circulate in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time, because it was a Nazi magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">On the inside of the magazine were pictures of the Army with men wearing swastikas. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There's a picture of the Fuhrer himself reviewing the troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There were pictures of the Hitlerjugend, and uh several of their activities, both in marching and in campfires and all other activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was a family magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My parents were horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They didn't know quite how this came about; except that my mother, naturally, rushed over to the photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">She said to him, "What is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">How did this happen?" </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And the photographer quickly sort of closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> , pulled the blinds, and told her to...very quietly admonished her to keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And he says, "Sssh...I will tell you the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was asked to submit the...my ten best pictures for a beauty contest run by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So were ten other outstanding photographers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So ten photographers submitted their ten best pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I sent in your baby's picture." </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And my mother said, "But you knew that this is a Jewish child." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the photographer said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And this is a quote that I have always... My parents say he said, in German, "Ich wollte mir den Spass erlauben"--"I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke." </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then he told my mother, "And you see, I was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect Aryan." </span><span class="sentence" id="89">There was a beauty competition to select a baby that would represent the perfect example of the Aryan race to further the Nazi philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That was pro...being promoted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Magazine came out in early 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh, my parents were both shocked by the possible consequences that this could bring, and amazed at the irony of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But they felt at the moment to keep...that 1t was best to keep it quiet. (</span><span class="sentence" id="94">Cough) Well, before...there were several consequences that resulted from this. (</span><span class="sentence" id="95">Cough) (Drinking water) Uh, one, my parents noted right away that <span class="BUILDING">dress shops</span> that advertised beauti...that had baby clothes, that were selling baby clothes had put the picture in their <span class="DLF">store front windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh, post cards were reproduced made from that picture just for mailing. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were used...they were on every <span class="BUILDING">newsstand</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They were post cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">One day, one of my mother's...my father's sisters, Ida...my Tante Ida--who was living in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> at the time--went into a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy me a birthday card for my first birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That was in May '35. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And she picked up...she saw that picture with a statement on the bottom " "--"Best wishes to the Birthday"-- as a birthday card. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And my Aunt Ida went to the cashier and said, "Where did you get this photo?" </span><span class="sentence" id="103">She says, "Oh, this is not just a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">This is a real baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It's a Berliner baby." </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my aunt didn't say another word, but she bought the postcard uh...which my parents brought with them throughout the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Uh, things were turning from bad to worse in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time, as we all know. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh, one of the things that happened is that my mother was somewhat careful about taking me to the <span class="BUILDING">Tiergarten</span> , and going with me <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">She didn't want people to recognize me...uh certainly when I started to talk, [to] say what my name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My Aunt Masha, my youngest...my mother's younger sister, came from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> at the time of my birth and spent a lot of time with me then, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And uh...she too is often very careful about where she took me and where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh, my mother had one friend who...of the family, Mrs. Grossman, who went to visit a friend of hers...uh in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Uh, I don't remember the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but it was not anywhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I think it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And this woman went to visit her friend, and found my baby picture framed on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And Mrs. Grossman said, uh, "My Gosh! </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Where did you get this picture?" </span><span class="sentence" id="118">She said, "Oh, this was...I got this from the magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Isn't that beautiful?" </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And Mrs. Grossman said, "But that is Hessy Levinsons." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And the woman said, "What! </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Levinsons, did you say?" </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And she ripped the...her picture off from <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Woman...and said, "Levinsons!?" </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And she was going to throw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And looked at it again and said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">This baby is too cute." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And she hung it back on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Those were just few of the incidences that happened at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh, my parents had uh been warned before...even before I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They had consulted the <span class="BUILDING">Latvian Consulate</span> about what to do, about how long to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And the <span class="BUILDING">Latvian Consulate</span> told them, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">German Jews... I mean, you're not Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And as Latvians, you don't have anything to worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You'll... I let you know when it's time to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Don't... You don't have to leave yet." </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And my parents... That's why my parents stayed for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But uh my sister was born at the end of 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And my father was set up doing fairly well, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">At one point, he had a very bad experience, however. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He was sitting in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">This accountant was a devoted member of the Nazi party, but he also got to like and respect my parents very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He became very friendly with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Hieronomus (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And in fact, one day, my...Hieronomous (ph) came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked my mother to help him sew on his swastika armband, because it was coming loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Fortunately, it was a Sabbath and my mother said to him, "You know, as a Jew I am not allowed to sew on the Sabbath." </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So she got out of that one easily enough, cleverly enough, I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Uh, however, Hieronomus (ph) played a very important role in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Uh, there was one day when the Gestapo marched into my father's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and simply arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It had turned out that somebody had reported him, for some reason that remains obscure. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">One of the uh people with whom he was dealing apparently reported him. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And my father was taken away by the Gestapo, and Hieronomus (ph) did (chuckle) a classic movie type scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He got in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and followed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that my father was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He was taken to some <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And within minutes, Hieronomus (ph) had followed, threw open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , apparently screamed, "Heil Hitler!" </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He was immediately admitted to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And Hieronomus (ph) vouched for my father as not being uh in any way associated with anything anti the Regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My mother also had some experiences that were sort of unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">One of the neighbors in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had uh reported her as having criticized Hitler once. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">She just...a comment she had made on one of...photographs that Hitler made once. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And the landlord of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> vouched for my mother. [</span><span class="sentence" id="162">He] said, "No, she could never have said anything unpleasant about our leader." </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And so there were people who helped them here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But things got very, very tenuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And so my father decided to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">During this time, my parents were very close to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And we had spent every summer in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Uh, in 1938, we had spent the summer in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Uh, that was the last time we went, because in the summer of '39 my father said, "This year we are not going." </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And probably if he hadn't made that decision, I wouldn't be here today. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">In any case, all those who were left behind were...died in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The only people who survived were one brothers of my mother's who came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ; some of my father's older brothers and sisters who had come here also when he was a child, long before the war; my Aunt Masha, who was with us in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ; and my aunt and uncle who had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Everyone else landed up being victims of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">My...L...1...1 should say... Let me back up a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">My two grandfathers had died before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My mother's father died when she was a child--the painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Uh, my father's father died shortly before I was born, and I was named after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">His name was Hessel (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Uh, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and life there was both interesting and difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Interesting, because my parents enjoyed the cultural life and excitement that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> has to offer; but difficult, because of the times, of course, and the difficulty of getting settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My father was amazingly ingenious, and was able to set up business and start working again. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Uh, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> fell, I became very conscious...I was told, "Don't speak German on the streets." </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And my sister and I were very conscious of the fact that we... somehow it was bad to speak German, and we...it was very difficult for us, who grew up speaking... At that time we spoke German and French. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But uh I remember one time we were befriended by some German soldiers, and they gave us chocolates. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we started talking to them, until we realized that we had been told not to do that and then ran away, very quickly. (</span><span class="sentence" id="187">Chuckle) Anyway, uh we were in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> altogether...uh we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell, and...or became occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And at one point, the concierge of my parents’ <span class="BUILDING">building</span> --which was tn the very elegant area of the 16th arrondissement in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> --uh told...warned us that Germans were coming and rounding up Jews, and suggested that we not go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">My father then arranged for my mother and my sister and I uh to uh go to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My sister 18 called Noemi. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So Noemi, my mother and I moved to [Mimac (ph)]-sur-Mer, which is in...on the coast, on the Atlantic Coast of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> --not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">My father stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> trying to arrange ways to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">He um...my mother had a rather difficult time in [Mimac (ph)]|-sur-Mer. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Uh, the...she was conscious of being the only Jew in this so-called <span class="BUILDING">resort hotel</span> where we...my father had arranged for us to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I remember distinctly there was one Frenchman who was rather aloof and cold and severe looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But he had a big dog that Noemi and I loved to play with, and we played with him quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Well, one day the landlady of the <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> told my mother that she would have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That she was under too much pressure, and that she could not keep us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So my mother went to the Chief of Police of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and he was very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He said to her, "I believe that there are people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who are not acting in the best interest for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I will see what I can do in your behalf." </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So my mother felt reassured. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Shortly thereafter, the man with the dog disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It turned out that he was spying for the Germans; and the Chief of Police was only too glad to have been able to accumulate enough evidence that I guess he had from other <span class="NPIP">sources</span> to arrest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Nevertheless, my mother's life got to be more and more complicated and trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And soon enough, shortly thereafter the concierge came and told my mother the same story again. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But this time, there was no question that she would have to leave by the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My mother tried her friend, the Chief of Police, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And he told her, "Madame Levinsons, I have done everything I can for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He could handle French, but right now the Germans were down his back and now he couldn't do anything further for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So that night, my mother tells me that she resorted to all praying and pleading for help...dlong sigh)...at guidance for her family from the Lord for some way of trying to see what she could do so she would not get separated from her husband because that's how families got separated during the war, and she knew that if she had to leave, he would never find us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And while she was up that whole night, pacing the whole night, around 4 o'clock in the morning there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and the concierge was knocking said, "Madame Levinsons! </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Madame Levinsons! </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Votre mari est arrivé.</span><span class="sentence" id="215">"--"Your husband is here." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was the most joyous moment my mother could imagine at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We packed up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and the four of us drove away and we drove to meet a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And my own memory 1s rather vague of that at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But we joined up with a group that was going to take us across <span class="REGION">occupied territory</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zone Libre</span> [NB: "Free Zone"], which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> was still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zone Libre</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We met some other people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> also, some other friends of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And...in this group; and we apparently at one point, we went <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">by truck</span> to a certain point, and then we had to go across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , walking through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> that...and be very, very quiet-- because apparently a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German encampment</span> was behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">At the end of that <span class="DLF">road</span> , at the end of those...there would be another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to meet us. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Uh, I did not know those details at the time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="224">Chuckle) What knew is that this very ominous looking Frenchman, who had this enormous knife around his belt, took it out and told the children that any kid who opened his mouth would have his tongue cut out. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Let me tell you, I have never forgotten that moment. (</span><span class="sentence" id="226">Chuckle) I went with my lips sealed like this throughout the entire escapade. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Except that, at one point, I couldn't contain myself and I asked my father's friend--who held me by the hand-I said, "What are we doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He said, "This is a sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We're running. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">This is a sport." </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I said, "I hate this sport." </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And then I saw this guy with a knife, and I contained myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The babies, the children--including my sister Noemi--were all fed chocolates. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They got all the chocolates one could round up during the war to keep these kids quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We got to the Zone Libre, and immediately my father applied for American immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Uh, I think, 1n fact, 1f-- although my memory is not quite sure about this at the time--I think, in fact, that my father had applied for it while he was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and had been granted it at that point when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But when you get an American immigration visa--which is hard to get, because you need to prove that you can sustain yourself and, you know, you're not going to land up being on welfare or burden to anyone in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , uh ...and that you are good health and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But even after all this, you are told that you have 90 days to reach <span class="REGION">American shores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And my father realized, as time was going by, that there was no way in which he could get his family to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> within the time timeframe left. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Thirty days before the visa expired, he requested an extension from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The Atlantic...you know, across the Atlantic, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commercial flights</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Uh, this was in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Uh, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> was patrolled. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Submarines...uh... Anyway, we waited for a reply from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And [it] eventually came, and it said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They denied us an extension. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, again, (sigh) I guess I could say it's not thanks to Uncle Sam that I am sitting here today. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My father tried every <span class="DLF">avenue</span> available to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">He went to a series of Latin American consulates in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and uh...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> ; and eventually landed up with a <span class="BUILDING">Cuban Consulate</span> who would listen to him, also accept some money, and granted him visas to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh, we spent a relatively...my sister and I have relatively nice memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Uh, it was...it was not much food. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">My parents never wanted to touch ratatouille again, because that's the only thing they ate for 8 months. (</span><span class="sentence" id="253">Chuckle) Uh, we didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We did try to lead some kind of normal semblance of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I remember it was that time when I learned swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I learned to swim, had some swimming lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Somehow tried to lead a fairly normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">The one very important person joined us at that time who had been left behind at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for a while, and that is our nurse, uh Gerta. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Gerta was a German-Jewish nurse who came to take care of me when my sister was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">In other words, my mother hired her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Uh, I was extremely spoiled at the time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="262">Laughing) I'm back tracking a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Gerta had a terrible time with me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="264">Laughter) Maybe partly because of all the fuss that was made about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But anyway, she vowed that the next baby's not going to be so spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Gerta was extremely attached to Noemi. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">To me, too, I think, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In any case, my parents were very devoted to her; and we both grew up feeling very close to her, uh and Gerta was with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">My father...uh eventually got us a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , and was told that Gerta would get the visa eventually, too, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because she had a brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So we left, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , we waited for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to take us to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It's funny, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">When I think back, my mother says she was wonderful...very good student in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> except in geography. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And geography was her worst subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">She didn't even know where <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> was on the map before she found out about us, and here we were going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But, in any case, uh the uh one interesting thing happened before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">My father heard that Gerta was not going to get the visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and that she was left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And he was going to try to get her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But by that time, there was a <span class="DLF">German line</span> of control and you had to have special passes to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles--</span> which we had, but my father did not have a pass to go back and get her. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And he really wanted to go back and get Gerta out. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So he thought he's going to try it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> without a pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He had a ticket, but that wasn't the issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And he got himself...he got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and then he thought of a very clever way to foil the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">When he got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> -the "<span class="DLF">border</span> " in the sense of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> --and, of course, at that time the Petain regime was cooperating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Although they were all French patrolling, they were all cooperating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And he thought [to] himself, "There is only one way to foil the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">What 1s it that is holy to the French? </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Dining and eating 1s holy to the French." </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So he went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining car</span> , and started eating and eating and eating and drinking and wined. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they sat at that <span class="DLF">border</span> for hours, and he kept on eating non-stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He wasn't do diddling or daddling. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And he ate for several hours, and nobody touched him. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And when he made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , he had a gold cigarette case that he went to pawn to get some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And he got that money, and was able to help Gerta in case she needed passage. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And then he went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban Consulate</span> and said he needs another visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He says, "Impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I am already in hot water for having given you all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I have given away too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I cannot give another person." </span><span class="sentence" id="306">My father was not dis...easily to be dissuaded; and he persisted and persisted, and, of course, they got nowhere for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And finally the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban Consulate</span> said, "You know, there is an old law on the books that when you're given your visa, you can take all your possessions with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Now, the old law says that slaves are a possession of the owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Would you say that this lady is...woman is your slave?" </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And my father quickly said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">She is my slave and my possession, and she needs to come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And on that basis, Gerta got the grant...visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But she did not have a pass to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , and that was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He somehow arranged for her to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">All of this was extremely complicated and extremely difficult to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">My father was really very ingenious. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh, and somehow, again, he got himself back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> through the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Apparently, on the way back there was not such a long border stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But the big crisis was on one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He had...he did have his visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> on...to show that he could get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So on the way back, it wasn't quite as difficult for him as rationale for going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We sailed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Portugese ship</span> , the _(ph), from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> in the beginning of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Uh, I remember stopping in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> to an impression I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The dazzling sun, the enormous amount of sand, women were all veiled, long robes for men. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I thought this was some storybook. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I had no idea what was happening and where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I was absolutely stunned at this image. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Uh, we were not...we did not get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> , Gerta got on. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And that was a very emotional reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Then we proceeded across the Atlantic with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> full of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">My dear father provided for his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We had a first class <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> all to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Before leaving Europe, my...one of the things my father had arranged for, while he was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , is to have all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> stored someplace safely in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And so he had it stored in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And the reason was not so much the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> --although it was quite elegant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Queen Anne furniture</span> which my parent...father had set up this very lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the Rue de Messine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when we had lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But the thing that was critical in that...in...in...1n that box that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> [was in] were my grandfather's paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There were three of them...three paintings in there, which my father managed to store in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , and which we recuperated after the war and after we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">The three paintings are, one, a self portrait of my grandfather, who looks like Toulouse-Lautrec--big black hat, big fur coat, very distinguished looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">A picture...painting of his father-in-law, [ _(ph)], in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The light shining on him looks like that picture would come alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I think that was the one that they wanted for the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And a third picture, of a painting of a poor man who used to not always have enough food that my grandmother used to offer a cup of tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">She'd offer him some borscht or some tea, and would feed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And so that's the portrait, the third painting that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">My Aunt Masha brought two other paintings too. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Uh, one is a magnificent...uh...paysage [Fr: "landscape" ]--a scene of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , the Berioshkas in snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And another is uh a scene of a...one of their brothers studying for Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So those are the five paintings that we now have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Anyway, we went on to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ...it took 3 and a half weeks to cross the Atlantic through a very circuitous route--to the very south, because we needed to avoid the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Uh, we went far south, I believe, to cross and landed up first in <span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span> , which was again a very interesting uh sight for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , the climate, the people carrying baskets on their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I remember little things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Anyway, we went on to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">This entire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> full of refugees, the entire hull of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the basement people sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , all these people... (Sigh) We got off on <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and were put in a camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Tiscornia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh, they didn't quite know what to do with us either. (</span><span class="sentence" id="359">Laughter) Which I guess was true of all the refugees, all from Europe and all different...many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And we spent several weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiscornia</span> , during which time my father figured how 1s he going to get started. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He had pawned most of what he had in Europe to pay for visas and passage and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ; and we had just some, you know, few suitcases of personal possessions with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He started to go to several <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and asked for a loan to help him get started for a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Uh, he had a lot of courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He just walked into many of the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , mostly <span class="BUILDING">American banks</span> that were uh...had had, you know, large <span class="BUILDING">branches</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And (Laughter) they all asked, "What do you have for collateral?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="366">Myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I am an honest man, and offer you me as collateral." </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And, as you can imagine, a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> doesn't deal with this kind of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And they all laughed at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Until, one day, he walked into the Royal Bank of Canada. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And the Canadian uh officials at the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> looked at him and said, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We think we're going to give you a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">We'll take our luck with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And so they helped my father get started. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He started first with uh some working in pin...with pineapple business, which was a wonderful product of <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , but realized that soon enough that wasn't going to be good for export to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because of competition from <span class="COUNTRY">Hawaii</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So he, by that time, got very clever about realizing that the Cubans had good cattle and were throwing away all kinds of meat casings and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Things that were...from the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter houses</span> , things that were in ample use in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Uh, and he decided to set up a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the first <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...such <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Uh, we lived a very good life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We learned Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Uh, we learned English, because my parents thought that we should go to a...someday we might still come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they wanted to send us to a English-speaking school. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">My parents were shocked at the <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Uh, the American kids seemed to them totally undisciplined--chewing gum, the kinds of things (laughing) my parents were totally not used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So Noemi and I landed up in a <span class="BUILDING">British school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">A rather strict <span class="BUILDING">British school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And we had a few months of instruction of English; and then, the fall of '42, started in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Uh, we knew neither language. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We landed up learning English and Spanish simultaneously. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We spoke German and French when we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Uh, we didn't find it difficult, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Kids learn very quickly, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It's a shame more people don't realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You learn...learning a language 1s very easy when you're a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Uh, the one thing we did rebel against is French lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">My father thought that French is a beautiful language, and he didn't want us to forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And so he hired a strict, fat, ugly French teacher to come and give us French lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Now, I should back up as a little personal history. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I grew up as a child not being able to stand ugly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">That's not a very good trait, but uh I couldn't stand an ugly nurse when I was a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I couldn't stand her to touch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And this French teacher just turned me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">My sister didn't want to learn French at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We both screamed and stomped, "We will never go back there! </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Whoever wants to go back to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Uh, my father persisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And, of course, we've been back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So, anyway, we both learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And Gerta, of course, was singularly untalented for learning any languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">She barely learned Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">She eventually learned English, and did go back to her brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But not until I was 12 and Noemi was 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So she spent a good time of...portion of time with us in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , always speaking German to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So we landed up speaking German and French, and German...I mean, and English and Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We had a wonderful life in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">My father became very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">My mother had help. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Life was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We enjoyed the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Uh, Noemi and I were...I was very, very reluctant to ever tell anyone that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I have not admitted that to anyone until I started telling people about the...my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Until then, everyone always thought that I was French. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">My friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> (laughter)...40 years later, I hate to tell them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They still think I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It was very...it was something we didn't want to admit, about being German. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Uh, even German- Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We just didn't want any part of anything that had the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We didn't want to talk German, except with Gerta. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I never did enjoy talking German after that; but now I guess I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Uh, I can also say that years later--even after I was married--and my husband went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on business trips many times, and I refused to go with him for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But that's just an aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Uh, eventually... Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  At what point did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Uh, as soon as we got a visa. (</span><span class="sentence" id="437">Laughter) My father wanted us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He did not want us to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> forever, uh because...for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He did not want us to marry Catholics, and he did not want us to lead the lives of the Cuban housewife--which invariably meant staying at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> while husbands had mistresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And he realized that was...did not correspond to his value system-- or my mother's, for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So it was again a matter of trying to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">After the war, of course, my parents being Latvian, they were...from citizens from behind the Iron Curtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And it was very difficult to get another Lat...American visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But we did come... eventually get the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Uh, and we uh...got the immigration visa in 1948, which meant that we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and immigrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You don't have to stay here as an immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I...You know, once you immigrate, you don't...that doesn't stop you from travelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> still for a year or so, then came back and eventually settled here. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Uh, my sister and I were both teenagers at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I spent only two years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and was very miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Uh, I was really not geared to be a New York teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I wore pigtails and bobby socks, uh no make-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I was really, uh as some of my friends said, "square." </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Uh, I was very unhappy in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Big <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Uh, I came from a small <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I eventually found my niche in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I found I had very good scholastic background from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">As I said, I only spent two years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I was able to, you know, finish my language study and I had good history background and I spoke English with a British accent-which, by the way, landed me the privilege of landing up 1n a foreign accent speech class in the New York City high school, to get rid of my foreign accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And there I found myself with all the Puerto Rican children, and we just had a wonderful time talking Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">In any case, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Barnard College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Uh, my father preferred that I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> rather than to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radcliffe</span> , so that I would still be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He was still commuting to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">His business was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">A high...a childhood friend, who came out of the camp with the numbers and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And he said to Charlie Salkin (ph), was his name, "Charlie, why don't you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , run the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I will do the export and the business end of it from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And so they did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">My father spent a lot of time commuting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , which is why he had hoped that I would stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I didn't think I would like <span class="BUILDING">Barnard</span> , but really began to find my niche there and really enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I majored in chemistry and did graduate in biochemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Uh, my father's business eventually collapsed in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">As you well know, the events in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> led to Castro, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And my poor father lost his business again. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And by that time, he was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And his friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , everyone, was very worried about how he was going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">My father was the eternal optimist. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He always said, "I have survived Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I will survive Castro." </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and his business was taken from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Charlie eventually immigrated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And his business apparently was sold to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and eventually collapsed because they couldn't run it. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They didn't have spare parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So as far as we know, it's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Uh, I met my husband in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Uh, my husband is born American. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">His name is Earl. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He 1s a mathematician. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He has a Ph.D. from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and was an instructor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> when I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Uh, we were married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">My uh...we had children several years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Our first daughter was born, Nina. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Nina Chaya. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We called ...named her after my paternal grandmother, whose name was Chaya. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And uh...two years later, in 19... Nina was born in 1963, and Alexander Joseph was born in 1965. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Alex was named after my mother's brother, Joseph, who had died shortly before he was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  Thank you very much. </span>
