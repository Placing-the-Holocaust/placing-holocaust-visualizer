ANSWER:  So they hear my dirty laugh all the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Well, never mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  They hear your dirty laugh all the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  That’s their loss or gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  So you father died when you were two, but how were you brought up, in what kind of atmosphere, and what kind of ideas were you brought up with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well, ideas, my mother didn’t have ideas, she was an actress, and she was very beautiful, and she was you know, surrounded by elegant and charming men, which was rather nice, you know, I rather enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But she was very childlike. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And she -- she certainly liked la grande vie, and she created this grande vie, which was, I think, brave of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She continued to have it after my father died, when there was some money, but not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And when it was gone she was particularly brave because she spoke absolutely perfect English, and she took to translating plays, which was -- course was a very, very good thing at the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because they had no plays of their own in the 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Later, Thomas Bennett came, but there were no Austrian playwrights. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Well, of course there were the -- Schnitzler and old ones, you know, but not modern ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So all the plays came from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , too, but <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was the -- and she did rather well, and she worked extremely hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">This I respected, I mean I -- I -- you know, I -- I think that I learned a lot from that, because I -- I -- I didn’t respect her for her childishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I --I did think that, you know, by the time I was 10, I felt that really she should be more grown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But -- but I did respect her staying up late, late, late into the night working so that she could get -- offer us this life, which she thought was essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Of course, I would never have thought it was essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And what kind of people did she surround you with? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I mean, were they actors, were they playwrights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, they were partly actors, and partly ar -- aristocrats, because she was very -- as I said, she was very -- you know, a very sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She went out a lot, she had absolutely beautiful clothes made by a little seamstress from models. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The seamstress came once a week for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Abso --
QUESTION:  As often as that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  As often as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She had a lot of clothes, and she would go to all the sales, sometimes dragging me along, and buy these abso -- the remnants, you know, of beautiful, beautiful materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And this little seamstress, who was absolutely splendid, and was able to copy models. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So anyway, all this, this was the sort of child life, until I was 11, and then by this time I had changed <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , had gone from, you know, my <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , which was a very ordinary <span class="BUILDING">state school</span> , which I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I had gone to a <span class="BUILDING">rryah gimnasium</span> , which is sort of -- you know, a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> for girls, called Lueetlan. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And -- and at 11 I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My brother -- I had a brother who was four years older than I, Guido. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Guido had already been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> years before, also at -- no he -- he ma -- he was sent at 12 actually, because my father wanted us brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , which was a very wise idea, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I mean, he also wanted us brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , which also happened, so you know -- not my brother, but I. So I -- I was able to speak these languages, you know, which is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">dramatic school</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  -- oh, sorry, from the fifth of May, I think to the 20" of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And by the 20" of May, we knew that we were -- we were going to be left with any number of abandoned children, or lost children, or orphan children. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we set up again, because all these people, you know, all these backers of the Auxiliaire Sociale, lucky they were very rich, and many of them had <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> in various corners of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we got a series of <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> -- part of <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> put at our disposal for them -- for starting <span class="BUILDING">children’s centers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And I took 16 kids on -- I can’t remember the date, but it was the end of May, before the Germans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , just before to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Villandry</span> , which was one of the great chateaux of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Loire</span> , and belonged to Isabelle de la Bouillerie, or rather her mother, who was American. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Ann Crawford -- I can’t remember what her se -- second name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Anyway, she had married this Spaniard, who owned this wonderful <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they gave us the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> , and they had -- before we came they had some of the castle workers, you know, put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , iron bedsteads and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> into -- and upstairs, they had actually in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> , I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And this is where we had our <span class="BUILDING">children’s center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And actually we ended up with I think 20 or 21 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So that was all right, it was -- 1t was a very -- you know, it was a -- it was certainly for me an incredible lesson when the Germans arrived, and I adore the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I mean, I was so pro-French, for no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I mean, I had nothing to fear with the Germans, and I had no reason to dislike the Germans, except what I had heard, all these elegant people around my mother say -- some of them -- some of them of course were Jews, because you know, most of the- most of the theater people really were Jewish, and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot of newspaper friends, there were a lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And so I -- I certainly heard in ma -- my subconscious I heard more things than in my conscious, but I had a real dislike for the Germans, which when they actually came into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I couldn’t find a reason for. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They were very nice when they came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They were very nice to the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They were absolutely charming to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You know, I had a -- a -- a -- I was introduced by Isabelle, of course it was not beyond making use of whatever she could make use of, so she introduced me with my father’s title, which of course didn’t give me anything at all, but she invented one. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So -- because the -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> the daughter of a count has no title. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So -- but I very quickly became countess, and they absolutely adored that, they loved this little Hungarian countess, you know, who spoke perfect German -- Viennese German at that, Volksdeutsch with a [indecipherable] art, you know, loved it -- if you understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Yup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Viennese Volksdeutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Anyway, so -- so I became her -- Isabelle’s interpreter, which was very useful for her, but extremely useful for me, because I -- you know, I learned more, I think, from that than I could have learned any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I mean, I spoke to so many Germans, most of them as I say, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">As the year went on, and things began to happen, you know, people began to be locked up, including friends of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , it was less nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And of course I was able to approach them on this, I mean ask them why, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And of course, a lot of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were arrested, which Isabelle learned about very quickly, as she had a very wide circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And -- and I -- I -- I challenged them on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And you know, most of them really didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Of course, most of the people we saw were army officers, you know, they were -- those were the people who came to see the chateaux. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I mean, you weren’t going to have the privates come and see chateaux, on the whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So the army officers, most of them professional army officers, they didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They said, “Well, you know, it’s the law, it’s the law.” </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And I -- I would ask, “Why is it the law?” </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I had great argument with two people who -- and this is the terrible thing, it’s a terrible -- I’ll never forget that, I -- I mean, I’m partly to blame for what happened, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Isabelle became very friendly with a German doctor, and a -- I wrote about that, the -- so you know about it already, a da -- da -- a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- former school director. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they came all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I mean, they came -- I think they must have come three times a week at least, to have tea with her, to have lunch with her, to have dinner even with her, you know, and she always called me in whenever I could get away from the children, and we both -- she very elegantly, and me not elegantly at all, would challenge them on all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Her secretary, who she had with her, was Jewish, Jacqueline, I can’t remember her other name, and she was very protective of -- of certainly of Jacqueline, and I think of -- or we -- two of our Auxiliaire nurses -- well, yeah, but they weren’t nurses, they were like me, I mean we were volunteers, and a mother and daughter, very good looking, were both Jew -- well, obviously both, but they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So she was very protective of them, and these two people just took it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And they -- I would ask and ask and ask, and they would say there is no explanation, it is the law, and most people agree with it, and blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Anyway, this went on and on, and one day they disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  The two German officers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And I had made another friend, who in fact saved me in the end, who was the head of intelligence, military intelligence, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span> , which was the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I went to see him, and I said, “These were our friends, what’s happened -- well, these are our friends, where are they?” </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And he said, “I don’t want you ever to ask about them again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I said, “No, but you have to tell us what happened, if you know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Where are they?” </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And he said, “I’m afraid they were arrested.” </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I said, “But why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And he said, “Because they saw too much of you French.” </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I don -- then later, you know, also through him, found out that the doctor was sent to the Russian -- to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , and he was killed very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He was the -- sent as a medic, but he was killed very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And -- and the school director was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , he was fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">You know, he was -- he -- 1-impossible for him to do anything in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , he couldn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And he died, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So you know we -- we really -- I mean this is something we - we -- we really made their lives, I think, very unhappy these last weeks they had, which 1s quite awtul. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Anyway, there you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">That’s how, you know, how it went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Anyway, by this time, I was doing little things, very small things, nothing of note, nothing heroic for -- for the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">B -- it was just starting, you know, the resistance really, in 1941 barely existed, barely. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It existed in <span class="NPIP">places</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> , but in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> of course, there was no resistance, I mean good God. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So what we did, the only things we did was on two occasions we managed to -- we managed to take care of some British fliers who -- who crashed, and who happened to crash -- one of them actually crashed in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , which was extremely convenient, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But the other one crashed, and somehow made his way to us, so we hid these two. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And we hid them by putting them in the <span class="BUILDING">children’s dormitory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The children just loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The two oldest boys gave up their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I mean, one on one occasion, and the other on the other occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And these bo -- these boys, you know, these young RAF boys, I mean, they were -- they were 18 - 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I mean, they were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And they -- our children were so excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">You know, now they were part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Anyway, however --

<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  What do you recollect about that happening, about the atmosphere, the general reaction, and your own reaction to all that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Well, you know, that was the -- the odd thing, because this is the first time, of course, I saw them again since 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So I was not -- you know, I was not as concerned as, of course, some of my mother’s friends were, and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">My mother ha -- was very concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">She had become engaged to a famous economist called Ludwig von Mises, who was Jewish, and -- but a very, very eminent man, and who is -- who had been already, for four years at the Ecole de Zoadsetude in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , so he was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I mean, they would -- he would come back every summer to go mountain climbing with her, that was their thing, and they were -- they were real, real country nuts, real mountain nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I hardly knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I mean, he was -- he didn’t come close to me at all, there was -- very severe man, I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I couldn’t -- I could not understand how she could be in love with him, but there you are, there you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And so -- so this was a worry of course, that she -- that she was very concerned, she was very worried about all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And -- and then of course, you know, it began, I mean you -- you -- you -- there were an awf -- as I told you, there were an awful lot of -- of Jews in the theater world, and I was at the Reinhardt seminar which was -- well, I mean, Reinhardt of course was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He was not there, I mean he had left in -- he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> last -- I can’t remember, but I think it was in January of that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He had done a wonderful production at his <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , which we all, of course, went to the rehearsals, and it was just absolutely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But then he left, and with him his -- his wife, Helene Thimig, who was -- you know, for whom we all -- I mean, we just adored her, I mean she was the most wonderful actress. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I mean, probably there were two great, great actresses in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">There was she, and Paula Wessely, two really great actress, and of course we, as very young people, we -- we just had adorations for these people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Anyway, she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That was a blow because we -- we did find out that she left because Reinhardt was a Jew, and he thought that the Germans were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And he was damn right. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He thought that the Austrians would not be able to withstand it, and he thought they were -- this I found out much later, but I mean, this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, you know, I was a little bit preconditioned against them by this time, all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And then they came in, and it was really quite strange, because you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> didn’t suit them, or they didn’t suit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I mean, they -- they were -- they were incredibly different. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I mean, the Viennese are -- I mean, I don’t necessarily like the Viennese all that much, but they -- the -- the - they are a very special breed, and it’s not a German breed. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It just isn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You know, it -- it -- it -- it dates back to the empire, the -- this extraordinary mixture, if you take a Viennese telephone book -- I don’t know whether you’ve ever done this, you take a Viennese telephone book, and you will see all the names in the world, I mean Polish, Czech, it’s all from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And you will hardly see German names. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">You know, and this -- this speaks -- this -- this says something, you know, and so when these Germans came in, all just like in 1934, looking wonderful, clean, you know, beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They were beautiful men, but they didn’t fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They didn’t fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And then, within two days we had really, at the seminar we had a real shock, because the seminar -- all the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> reopened, the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and -- and the --
QUESTION:  Within two days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  Within two days, yes, on the 15" they reopened. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And so we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the first thing we saw was the administrator who Reinhardt had put in, Dr. Neidafuhr, wearing a swastika. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And this was absolutely extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Now this is when -- no, it was not then, it was a little bit later, I realized something that had happened, which I had not really sort of ful -- fully taken 1n the real reason for. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We were -- we were preparing, or we did -- you know, we had these student performances of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  [coughing] Forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Do go on, so sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  No, that’s all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Well anyway, a couple of months before we had prepared this -- this 1s -- not a couple mo -- it was in -- before Christmas, before Christmas ’37, we were preparing Gorky’s, “The Buffoon,” I don’t know whether you know that play. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And a -- there were these two women’s parts, Natasha and Natalia, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I played one of them, and we had two casts, who would play alternative -- you know, alternately, for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I was in the first cast. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And th-the play was being -- there -- there’s a story, there’s -- the play was being produced -- directed by of course a student, but under the supervision of a man called Geyer, G-e-y-e-r, who was the most charming man. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">He was the -- he was the director of a big <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">Volkes theater</span> , and he was one of our teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I mean, they were all people like that, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And -- and he was charming. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He was incapable of ever telling anyone that he was no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So everybody adored him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And he had given these parts, he had you know, assigned these parts to the people he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And the girl who had my part in the second cast, I thought was very good, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And suddenly it was taken away from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And there was sort of gossip going on that Neidafuhr had taken it away from her, and she was absolutely in despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And it is only much later that I found out that she was Jewish, because you know, really nobody- this is something that people find very difficult to understand, but really we didn’t know who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">There were -- I think there were six Jewish students, I afterwards of course, found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">In -- in the -- in the two year -- in the two year --
QUESTION:  Course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Yeah, the courses last two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  So there were -- I don’t know there were -- all together I think there were 70 students. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And there were six Jewish students, and she was one of them, which we found out, of course, when all this happened, when the nat -- when the Nazis came in, cause they disappeared very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I mean, it’s not that they were arrested or anything, but they were taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or they were expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Then I realized that she had been taken -- that he had taken -- when I saw him with the swastika, I discussed it with some friends, and we decided, having then -- by then found out that she was Jewish, that he had taken it away from her because she was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  But nothing was said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  No, nothing was said. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I mean, what could you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Wo -- how can you attack as a -- as a student, how can -- you -- we were all very young, and you know, we’re not -- we were not educated in this -- in this civic response thing, which -- you know, which one gained with time. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I mean, which then I gained of course in the -- and -- and exercised on these poor two Germans who we became friends with, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But that -- back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in ’38 -- I mean in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , we had -- there was less civic conscience around than -- than you can possibly imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I mean, good God, they de -- they haven’t had any civic conscience until 1986 when Waldheim -- when the Waldheim story arose, then civic conscience at last became a reality in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and now, it’s different. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But it’s taken a long time, hasn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Anyway, in °38 -- listen, the long and short of it is that the Viennese were absolutely delighted by the arrival of the na -- of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And of course, it was not only the -- the Viennese, I mean the Austrians were delighted, and one has to see this unemotionally as one can. </span><span class="sentence" id="325"><span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was economically unviable. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It only existed in tourism. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">There was no other way for <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And since -- I mean, now of course I found out so much more, you know, I know so much more now than I did, I didn’t know any of this of course, because I was -- I had absolutely nothing to do with politics, but I know now, I mean that -- that the social democrats, can you believe it, were the first, who in the early 20’s wanted an annexi -- an -- an annexation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">You see? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Without -- I mean, at that time of course, they were not the Nazis, but they were -- this -- this anschluss to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was the thing that had gone through the 20" century, the early 20" century, and the more people realized, after the empire died, that the only way that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- that <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> could survive was as part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The more people, you know, felt this, and this was not -- really not because they were -- I mean, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you see mostly, but also elsewhere, this became a -- well, it became thought of as everything stemming from anti-Semitism, and this isn’t true, never was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Of course the -- all -- a -- <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , you know, was -- was -- was -- behaved absolutely atrociously about it’s Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I mean, really atrociously, worse than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But it -- 1t was not really -- that was not the reasons why they wanted the Germans, it was economic. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And the ideological part was very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Very powerful, but very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Very powerful, alas. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And becoming more powerful all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">As the Germans came in, things became much better very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And for the first year they were there -- and I was not there then any more because my mother really had to leave, you know, with being this -- this marriage well known -- I mean, this about to be married to Louie -- to Lou. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So we -- we left at the end of May, so I was only there for two months, in Nazi -- occupied Nazi -- not occupied, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi Vienna</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It was -- it wasn’t occupied, I mean, it was not a victim, they were not victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Really not. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I mean, they wanted the Germans.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Well yes, that was -- that was -- that was the one I wrote in fact, the -- it’s -- that was really shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I mean, we were walking -- it was actually not coming from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we were going for a walk, and I think, I honestly think it was a Saturday, but I’m not sure, because w-we would have been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Or maybe it was the 14, no I think it was on the 14", it’s before the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> reopened. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That’s it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And he -- she and I went for a walk through the innerashtatsa -- through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">inner city</span> , you know where -- which is where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">She didn’t, in fact, she lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fourth district</span> , but she came and w-we -- we were always together, so we went for this walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And we were walking along the Graben, which is a beautiful, beautiful <span class="DLF">street</span> , right -- you know, it’s right in the center, it was two minutes from where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And -- and we saw this -- this -- this group of laughing people, and there were two -- two Germans -- I mean, or maybe they weren’t, maybe they were Austrians, but they were in uniform, black uniforms with, you know, swastika arm bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And we made our way through this crowd, there were probably about 50 - 60 people, a lot of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  So we couldn’t see anything from -- from outside that circle, but we made our way through, and -- and there we saw these -- this -- this group of -- of elder -- really elderly -- well, elderly, I mean they were not young, ladies and gentlemen, because that’s what they all were. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">You know, you could see it, I mean it was -- you could see it in their clothes, you could see it in their faces, I mean it was not -- it was not -- 1t was not criminals, that’s what I’m trying to say, they were ladies and gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And they were brushing -- they were cleaning the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> with toothbrushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And I recognized Dr. Berggriin who was my pediatrician -- who had been my pediatrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And I loved him when I was a small girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He was -- and he saved my life, as a matter of fact, when I had diphtheria. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Anyway -- and he was one of them, and his wife, whom I didn’t know, but I ne -- finally found out, of course, that she was his wife, was with him, and she was doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And --
QUESTION:  On hands and knees, and --
ANSWER:  Oh yes, absolutely, on their knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And -- and we went -- and they had a couple of, you know, buckets where they dunk the -- soapy buckets where they dunk the toothbrush in. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Anyway, so I went up to one of these Nazis and said, “Are you mad? </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Are you completely mad? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">What are you doing there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I said, “Did -- did you realize that one of these men -- I mean, I don’t know who the others are, but one of these men 1s a savior of lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="370">He saved my life when I was a baby.” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He said, “What are you, a Jew?” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And I said, “No, but what does that got to do with it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And -- but Elfie was much more effective than I, because I was rather dumpy little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I mean, I was not ugly, but I was dumpy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I was not a beauty at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She was a raving beauty. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She was a dancer you know, she has a wonderful little body, and -- and she was am -- actually a few months younger than I, I think she was still 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And she had this -- this thing, this black -- sorry, this black hair, but you know all silk. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I mean, it was the most beautiful thing you can imagine, I mean she -- she really was su -- I mean, people would turn around in the <span class="DLF">street</span> when we walked along the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I mean, she was so incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And she had a wonderful voice, and then she became an operetta star. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But never mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">She wen -- she was go -- we were both going up to these -- to these characters. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And she said, “Is that what you call our liberation?” </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And she sang it out, you know, and it -- it we -- I think the whole <span class="DLF">street</span> must have heard it, in this wonderful -- she had this wonderful voice, and she had -- really she was working extremely hard at the seminar on her voice, because she had this beautiful singing voice, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And so they -- they really- they -- she -- they all knew she was going to be a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I mean, there was just no doubt, she was so beautiful, you know, and talented, I mean she was talented. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">She was not a great dr-dramatic talent, but oh, wonderful personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And do you know, it was really the most extraordinary thing that you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">All these people who’ ve been around there laughing, you know, and- and -- was disgusting, it was a disgusting sight, they all melted away. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I don’t think it took more than five seconds and they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And then these two characters disappeared, and then there were only these people, all still on their knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I don’t know how many there were, you know, I didn’t count them. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And then slowly they got up and they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And then prof -- Dr. Berggrin, he was a professor as a matter of fact, Dr. Berggriin came up to us, with his wife, he -- which I now realize that was his wife, little woman, little round woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Oh, her face, you know, was just so exhausted, and so frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he said in a very severe voice, ““You must never do this again, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It is very dangerous for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And then I found out they killed him, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They killed him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> in ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And her, no doubt, I mean I -- you know, I only found this out much later, but that was absolutely terrible, and of course it stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Elfie too. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">You know, Elfie, too, I mean I left and then I -- but Elfie and I remained in correspondence for a long time, until she really didn’t dare to write any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But she -- she really loathed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">She loathed them also partly because she found out that her father had been an illegal Nazi, and -- and he had told her, the day before this happened, on the 13" of March, my birthday, he had told her that -- or was it even on the 12", at dinnertime, he said that she was never to talk to any Jew again, and that all these s-sou -- Saujuden they called them, they would all be taken care of, or whatever, you know, eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And she told me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">She was in despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">She was really in despair, because we loved all these teachers, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They were very important to us, I mean they were our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were very important people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but it was not because of that we loved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They were -- even those -- I mean there was one who was actu -- actually really disliked by everybody except me. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It’s really true, I was the only person who liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He was the director of Reinhardt’s <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , his name was Anslotter, and he was a fine novelist. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">He wrote really wonderful novels, which I had read all his novels, so I liked him already for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And then for some or other reason he liked me, I don’t know why, but he did, because I really was not a -- I was not a -- well, I mean there were very talented people at the -- you know f-for -- for acting at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I was not one of the most talented ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I was not without talent, but I was not -- you know, I would never have been a great actress.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  I would have been useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But he liked me, and he put me into one of the other of his productions. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Three productions he put me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">In one of them a lead. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I think I was pretty bad, but never mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Sa -- it was a -- is a play which you probably don’t know, it was -- it’s called in German, “Geshwista siblings,” by Gerta.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Go straight ... So, after spending part of the war in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , you returned to Europe a few months before the end of the war, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Tell me --
ANSWER:  I returned with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  You returned with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Tell me what you did with them, and where you were, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Well, I returned for the purpose of serving in displaced person’s camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They needed people with languages, and of course they needed to -- they were very keen to have somebody who already had experience with children -- with children such as the children I had taken care of in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged as a -- as an assistant, because I was young, an assistant child welfare officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I then became a -- you know, I was promoted, but I went there in a rather junior position, and I’m trying to think where my first assignment was. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Yes, my first assignment -- well, I was first, as a matter of fact, my very first assignment was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , which was quite a shock because I’d -- I didn’t realize that that would be my first assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> , which was the -- the <span class="BUILDING">western allied headquarters</span> for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And a huge, huge sort of -- oh, it was this -- you know, former I don’t know what it was, but hundreds of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and things, and -- and that’s where we all stayed for awhile, had various lessons 1n this and that, and orientation, and then were assigned from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And to my great surprise, I was called in and I was told that I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I said, “But there are no children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And the -- the woman who was talking to me, she said, “I’m afraid you’re going to have a rather shocking surprise.” </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I really did have a shocking surprise, because there were a lot of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was not -- you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> is much misunderstood in the -- in the literature, and by historians. </span><span class="sentence" id="450"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , as you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn’t be addressing you, but anyway, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> the Nazis opened, and it was purely a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It was for -- it was intended for German political prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually became, in fact, the kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It was not intended for Jews at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And later it was represented as an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , which it never was. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I have just read a -- a completely new book, which in fact has not yet been published, but is about to be published in three weeks in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and it still has this presentation of it, which is really a great shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">This is particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that they misrepresented. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It is as if it’s a need, always to associate, you know, the Nazis with the crime against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Now, of course, all of us who write, up to a point, have to do this, because it was the worst thing they did, and you cannot not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But if you do that exclusively, then you are misrepresenting history. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And you’re misrepresenting what Hitler was, what his plan was, what the whole thing was, and why the danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole of Europe, or the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I mean, the death of the Jews was the worst thing, of course, and the factory killings, and -- but it was -- basically it was a part of a huge geopolitical program which really the -- most of the world doesn’t know because it has so focused on that one part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And it’s understandable, I mean, emotion is understandable, but historically it’s wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Anyway, so when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , there was -- there were all these kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And there were two groups of kids, which is also extremely interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There were the child -- there were no Jewish children, virtually no Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Maybe one or two somewhere, but this was not -- you know, the Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or two, there were -- there were a few, but it was- there -- that was the easiest. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They brought in -- <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> had a -- had a special issue, like a special division for taking care of -- of Jews who survived the Nazis, and they very sensibly assigned to this, or made responsible for this division, Jewish UNRRA officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I mean, it was the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can deal with it better, and they could -- and they would be accepted much better by these victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And so this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> too, within da -- I mean, I came there very soon after it was -- after the Americans arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I mean, really within days. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And within -- again within days, some of UNRRA officers arrived, who took away the Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">That was -- you know, that was wonderfully organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I was left with another -- with another <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I think she was -- I think she was a higher rank than I. But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became -- had become friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And we put in -- were in charge of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And you have -- these were all on the one hand, children whose parents had been brought into -- into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as forced laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So they were mostly Polish and Russian children. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and Russian, and a few words of German here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Some Czech children, but mostly, as I say, it was eastern European children, who had either been brought in by themselves, or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Because in quite many -- in quite a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , letting them take their smaller children. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">In quite a few cases, not -- not -- not -- not -- it was not a rarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So we were landed with quite a few quite young children, who couldn’t speak [indecipherable] the girl who was -- sorry, the girl who was with me was of Polish descent, an American of Polish descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">She spoke Polish, which was a great help. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Anyway, so that was one group, and the other group were German children. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And they were the children of the 20" of July German officers, who had been in the assassination plan against Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">This was an extraordinary thing, because here you had these German children, who had gone to <span class="BUILDING">elite schools</span> , you know, who were very, very German children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  They were all absolutely beautiful, almost -- almost all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And they were living with children who they had been taught to despise, from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> they had been taught to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And they were really very dependent on these children, because you know, where the children were older, they were put in charge of the groups, I mean, they had group leaders and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And they had no German group leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Can you imagine the Americans allowing German group leaders? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">No sir, not even amongst children. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning of Tape Two, Side A

ANSWER:  So in fact it became very soon one of my great problems because, I mean, I was only there for two and a half weeks, but I was told from the beginning that I had no responsibility for the German children. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Well this, of course, was ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I mean, to me it was ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">You couldn’t -- I mean, this was a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because while it had been intended for -- as I told wa- told you before, what -- what -- what it was intended for by the Germans originally, but over the last -- over the last six months of the war, as the war turned against the Germans, they walked people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">eastern camps</span> , including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and so on, they walked them all the way down to -- to -- to <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , which was meant for -- I cannot remember really how many, but certainly not more than five to eight thousand, and when I came there, there were 30,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So I mean, it was just absolutely appalling, and impossible for the inmates, you know, to keep it clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I mean, you ca -- if you -- 1 -- 1 -- one has to imagine, for instance, the hygienic possibilities, which really were perfectly all right, I’m sure, when they started this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Cause they were very hot on hygien -- hygienic matters, the Germans, and -- and you know the -- one could see -- I could see ho -- what there was originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I mean, there were enough <span class="INT_SPACE">loos</span> , certainly, for 5,000 prisoners, and certainly enough ablution, as they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was just sort of -- oh, well it was taps, with water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  But you know, with the -- lots of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And certainly enough for five thousand people to wash, but not 30,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And it was impossible to keep the loos ti -- clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was absolutely impossible, particularly as most of them had diarrhea, and all kinds of nasty things. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So it was a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> when we got there, really terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And there wasn’t very much we could do except what really our job was, which was to get the children out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Our job, our -- this was our -- we were commissioned to do this, to get the children out, into UNRRA installations, which were being -- were just being opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I mean, it was completely new, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">But w-w-we did, we -- we got, in these two and a half weeks, which were all we were allowed, we -- we did get, probably about a thousand children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And we couldn’t get the German children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We were told this was the business of the German Red Cross, and it was -- well, I had terrible fights with the Americans about this, because it was the German Red Cross, but they wouldn’t allow the German Red Cross into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">This was the sort of thing that happened there, and so it was a -- you know, it was a -- a -- a total impossibility, the little German children could not be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So of course we took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I mean, of course we did, against -- you know, against -- but we couldn’t get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">That was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So when we left, having transported, or having arranged for transport for these about thousand children, w-we saw behind us these German children. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">There weren’t that many, I mean, there were probably about a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">A hundred is a hundred, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And there was no food.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  So kind of subsidized housing --
ANSWER:  Or subsidized housing, but -- but the Germans did this sort of thing -- the Nazis did this sort of thing very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I mean, they were all rather pretty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flats</span> , with all the conveniences you can possibly think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And we threw out about 4,000 people, and took their flats. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And of course they loathed us, as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But that is where -- well of cour -- I ha -- didn’t have the thousand children, you know, I had about a hundred of these thousand children. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And so I -- I was in charge of these hundred kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">No, this was not a shock, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I very quickly found Polish DPs, Polish false laborers, and -- who came because they heard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was there, and w -- had been established -- or was being established. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They were extraordinarily good. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I mean, they were - you know, there were also some former officers, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It was very quickly -- I felt th -- as I remember it, it was quite extraordinary, how within one week we had set up a whole hierarchy of- of helpers who could speak, of course, to the children, to start out with. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Who were teachers, had been teachers in their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Had -- there were two doctors, you know, we had all -- we had -- we had several who had been professional officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">In fact one of them became the head of the -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I mean, the -- the DP head -- there was always a DP hierarchy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  You established that, and you were above it, but I mean, basically you weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I mean, they did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  You just were there to -- to help them with any, really, bureaucratic problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  I also did do some -- you know, some welfare work, because I had -- I’d -- I’d trained to do this, you know, and -- and of course I loved doing it, particularly with the children, I mean children -- there were problems with the children, as you can imagine, I mean they were -- they were -- they were alone, they -- they didn’t know where their parents were, they -- I mean, they were homesick, they were th -- million things. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But no, I was not shocked, it was -- it was a -- this is really what I meant in -- I wrote in one of my books that -- that certainly what happened in <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , and what I saw and learned there, was the most valuable experience of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I think it di -- it -- it -- I think it orientated, if you like, everything that I have done since. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I mean that -- all my thinking, and -- so it’s -- it’s extraordinary what you learn when you are -- you know, when you are close for two years to -- to people with appalling problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Then you -- you -- well, above all, of course, you realize that whatever your private little problems are, they’re nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They’re nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">You are extraordinarily lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You know, you have -- y-you have -- I, in fact, had -- had no roots, because I had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> really. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But I never minded, because I always saw myself as a European. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So it -- 1t meant -- made absolutely no difference, I -- I didn’t -- I wasn’t -- I -- I didn’t miss anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I di-didn’t miss <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , though I loved it, but I didn’t miss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">If -- if I missed anything, probably, aside from my adoration for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I missed <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> most, where I had three very happy years in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">You know, I really loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And -- and really I was extremely happy when I -- when I met my husband and he -- years later in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and he was a “Vogue” photographer, and -- and he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and he fell in love with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and that was a very happy thing for me, because there we were, two of us, in love with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So that was good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Now, unless I’m mistaken, you’ve said your most difficult UNRRA posting was to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , in -- in *56?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> was very difficult because it was a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  20,000?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  20,000 Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And you really have to be with 20,000 Ukrainians to understand what that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I mean, it’s -- it -- they are -- they are the most stubborn people, and I don’t want to call -- that’s always stupid, I want to -- don’t want to generalize and say they were self-serving, but certainly their -- the he -- the people who headed that, completely different from my Poles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilshofen</span> , and the next <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was, I also had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Th -- wh -- who -- who were totally unself-serving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  Now, the Ukrainians were th -- j-ju-just -- and they -- they didn’t -- the -- the heads of -- of that 20,000, you know, group, they did not care who knew it, they were the heads of it, and never mind the foot soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So it -- it -- it -- 1t really was a -- a difficult thing, and to think that these people came -- you know, came out of a Communist -- basically out of a Communist, if you like, childhood and past. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Maybe it was the reaction to it, because it seemed to me that they were more fascist, but -- than -- than -- than most Nazis I had known, and I knew a hell of a lot of Nazis, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="588">They were also violently anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I mean, they were much more anti-Semitic than any Nazis I had ever met. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And this is something that in <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was a -- was a -- a -- a real problem, because we -- you know, we -- we didn’t have actually -- I mean, I didn’t take care of -- I told you that’s a -- I already said this, of course, the -- the Jewish DP’s were taken care of separately by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , and that was the right thing to do, because they were able to care for them properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">But there were, amongst us staff, of course there were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We were totally mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I mean, we came from -- I don’t know, there were 12 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> represented in <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  And the teams were totally mixed, and nobody knew who was what religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But it came out, you see, when there was this terrible anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Because somehow they knew who amongst the UNRRA staff was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  And so what would happen, what would that provoke?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Oh, they would call them names in -- in -- in Ukrainian, and things, which then we were told by our interpreters what they had said. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And all of -- all of -- all of the staff were told, so of course, that created a very difficult situation, because you see, none of us really could be in any way, anything but neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We had to be neutral toward all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And you really couldn’t expect people who heard themselves called these names, like you know, Jewish pigs and all that sort of stuff, you couldn’t really expect them to behave neutrally toward the people who -- who -- who behaved like this, DPs who behaved like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Extraordinary in this <span class="NPIP">time</span> but -- and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Absolutely extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So th -- it was -- it -- but it was not just this that made it difficult, I mean there were -- there were huge difficulties, because of course the one thing these people who all -- who had all decided to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , not to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , and the one thing they were afraid of were the Soviet liaison officers. [</span><span class="sentence" id="608">phone ringing] That’s yours, not mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  That’s ma --
ANSWER:  Well, so this was a -- this was very -- there were very, very many, you know, conflicts in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And solving the conflicts, and remaining neutral, and yet being in an atmosphere which was profoundly political was really very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And it was not only, of course, the -- the DPs who -- who were difficult, but as I already indicated, the -- the -- the UNRRA team was very divided, you know, and we had a -- we had in -- in -- in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we had an American director, whose name I will not mention, who knew absolutely nothing -- like many Americans, I’m sorry to say, at the time -- nothing about the problems of eastern Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And you know, to be in that position, and not to know anything about <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , that was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It was really impossible, you -- you -- you did a lot of harm then. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And we really would have needed, and certainly didn’t get while I was there, a director who -- you know, who was -- we had an Australian who was the deputy director, and he was excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He was a historian, I mean he had a degree in history and was deeply interested in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And he was splendid. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Without him, I think -- I don’t know, I -- I think we would have had tragedies. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And with tragedies I meant -- I mean more suicides. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We had suicides, but we would have more suicides, we would have had more violence; we had violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So you know, we had all the things that we were there to prevent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  And lurking among those 20,000 were probably some pretty unsavory characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Oh, very unsavory characters, I mean, I wrote about this, I mean, somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I don’t know whether I wrote about it in any of the books, but -- but I certainly wrote about it for the times. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I mean, we -- I mean we had former -- former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guards in there, which -- who -- who -- in -- in a few cases were 1n fact identified by former prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But it was very frightening, I mean some of them were really frightening people. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I remember one person who was actually on the war crime list, and -- and I -- I found him. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I -- I found this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">He was a Czech, oddly enough, and was hiding as a Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Spoke some Polish, and was very bright, and had done the most awful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I mean really awful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And as I say, I was able to identify him, and the Americans, you know, sent a team to arrest him, and that was a very frightening evening, I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Because I was absolutely certain, I had no way of -- of proving this before, but I was absolutely certain that he was armed, which afterwards was found true, his- his <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> -- in fact, the whole <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was under his thumb, and they were armed to the teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And of course, nobody was allowed to be armed in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA camp</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And we had -- we had some, but it’s only the American army who were allowed to search <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">We were not -- nor did we want to, because it would have destroyed our -- our relationship with them, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But we had never searched this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and I was absolutely certain they were armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And it turned out -- I mean, it was -- it was really scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  Had they brought these arms with them, or smuggled them in, or how did they go --
ANSWER:  God knows, God knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  You don’t know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Never found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">All these -- the people in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> were all taken out of this particular team area, and were -- that was very wise, and they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  Talk to me now about the stolen children, and about the story of Johann and Marie in -- in particular, that’s --
ANSWER:  Yes, well --
QUESTION:  I don’t know, in any way that you’d like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  Well the stolen children is again, you know, it’s a -- it was a -- a very complicated thing which -- which is true, I mean, I was certainly one of the people who found out about this, it was a -- because -- I mean, probably because I -- I spoke, of course, fluent German, which very few of the UNRRA people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Most of the UNRRA people came, as I said, from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , or -- or some -- or from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And then there were, of course, from the 12 <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> , but -- but really I had -- I only knew one other person who spoke German, fluent German. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So I did find out about this problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I had no idea how wide it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I mean, that only came out when the American army people -- I mean the Intelligence people really went into it and they -- they -- well, they investigated this pretty thoroughly, and so did the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And it was found that, I mean, the -- these children, you know, were all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  E-Explain for people who might not know what the stolen children are, who they were, and how many --
ANSWER:  Well, the stolen children, n -- ne -- of course this 1s very important because it’s -- it’s -- it’s part of what I was saying before, you know, about the problem that people see the Nazis, they still see the Nazis, particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , as purely a Jewish problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And of course, the stolen children are a very, very important proof that it was not that. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The stolen children were a part of Hitler’s racial plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And it was a racial, it was purely racial. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">These children all came, almost all -- there were some Greek children, but most of them, the vast majority, they were supposed to have been in -- I can’t -- I can’t swear to this, a -- we were given this figure, and it may be right, it may not be right, but there was supposed to be 250,000 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And most of them, by far, far -- and the -- th -- this was -- of course, the -- the figure, which was confirmed by the Poles, because most of them came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The Nazis had ordered that a certain number, and I don’t know whether they put this number, I have no idea, but that their officials, who were specially assigned for this program, because this was a huge project, were to bring into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , children as of age one, who were blonde and blue eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They only wanted blonde and blue eyed children, which -- which of course turned out to be a total nonsense because almost all children are blonde and blue eyed when they’re born, and remain this for, you know, quite a long time, into -- may well be two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I mean, I had one little thing, a little girl, who I finally got, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And who had been -- who I found -- and who had been stolen, and who was apparently blonde and blue eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Her foster parents, as I call them, I mean they ri -- she s -- she thought they were her parents, and she adored them, her German parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And they told me oh, she was the most beautiful blonde, blue eyed baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And do you know she was almost black haired? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And - and her eyes were brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">It was absolutely extraordinary, she was no -- and they had -- you know, they didn’t see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">When this woman, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wirtsburg</span> -- I’m going to start, this all comes back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">This is not this Johann and -- and -- as I called them, yo -- mem -- Johann and Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">These are just names I invented, you know, but this woman, when I -- when I saw this little girl, you know, who was adorable, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But -- she was four, not three, she was four. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And here’s this dark haired, brown eyed child, who I wasn’t at all sure wasn’t Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And this woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wirtsburg</span> , this mum, who adored this child, went on and on about this lovely blue eyed, blonde child. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I finally said that frau whatever her name was, “She’s absolutely adorable, and you’ve done a wonderful job with her, but she is very dark haired and brown eyed.” [</span><span class="sentence" id="672">indecipherable], she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And she -- and she looked, and st -- and really she gave me the impression -- I may be talking nonsense -- but she gave me the impression as if she had never noticed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">To her, this was the blonde, blue eyed baby who had been given to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Now these children who were given only -- let me just say this, they were only given to members of the Nazi party of good s -- in good standing, who wanted children, who either couldn’t have children, or whose children had died, or -- or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">There was always a good reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And who were known to be, in all probability would be good parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They were very, very careful about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I did not -- I met a lot of the parents, and of course I met a lot of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I did not meet one single child or one German parent where they didn’t love each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  But of course the Germans were less careful, the Nazis were less careful about how they actually got these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They kidnapped them from this --
ANSWER:  Oh no, they -- they were totally uncareful. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I mean, they kidnapped them off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , they went int -- they went into <span class="BUILDING">nurseries</span> , they went into -- into <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I mean, it was absolutely appalling how they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And the parents --
QUESTION:  Did the program have a name? </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I mean, th --
ANSWER:  In -- the German name, there was a name, but I’ve forgotten it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]

<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  How old were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Well, there were small ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I mean, this 1s -- the four year old was part of it, of this particular group. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But I mean, they were up to, you know, 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They tried to take them under 10, below 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But they did have some children who were school children. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I mean eight -- seven, eight, nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And -- and this was particularly difficult for them, too, because the smaller ones, of course, you know, they didn’t know really, what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">If they were very small, I mean babies, like my little -- this little four year old, she didn’t -- she had absolutely no idea that there was a Polish parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And she adored her -- of course she adored her -- her Wirtsburg parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But the older children -- I mean, we had -- we already, when we had them in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , because we would -- we had them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">conditioning camps</span> , you know, we opened special stolen children conditioning centers.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Staging post, <span class="BUILDING">conditioning centers</span> we called them to ourselves, where the children received that kind of care that -- you know, that was needed at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I mean, also they received lessons in Polish or Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And -- and -- and they stayed for awhile, I mean they stayed two, three months in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and were very unhappy, very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">They’ve been taken away from people they loved, even though they knew that there were -- the older ones I’m now speaking of -- they knew that there were parents elsewhere who were their real parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But you see they -- they had been there for three or four years in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they had had no bad experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They had only been loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And if they had not been, because some of them could not be kept in families, and they were sent to Hitler youth, well really centers. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But there again, you see, I mean I’ve -- you know, I’ve been to these <span class="BUILDING">Hitler youth centers</span> , and I -- I know it’s not popular, particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for one to say this, but you know, they were very well run. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And the young people who were in charge of them were good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They were not bad people. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And they -- when they got these young, foreign kids, they were nice to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">There was a lot of tenderness. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I mean, I went to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they were in fact I -- I -- I fo -- I found, you know, one -- one little erght year old boy who had been there for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And -- and I stayed in a -- in an <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA center</span> , in an untr -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA camp</span> -- not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but in an UNRRA team in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  And -- because I wanted this little boy to get to know me slowly, because I was going to take him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And he had been taken away now so many times, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So I didn’t want to do this suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So I thought I’d give him four days, which isn’t long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  But you know, it’s as long as one could -- could afford really, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And so I would go and spend most of the day there, so that he would see me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And I would be there in the evening, and I saw these Hitler youth leaders, as they were called, go around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and kiss the children good night, and tuck them in, and you know, and -- and -- and smooth their hair, and -- oh, and they also asked, did you clean your teeth and all the rest. [</span><span class="sentence" id="731">indecipherable] like all parents do. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But I never heard any cross word. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Of course, boys of that age, I mean, th-they also learned to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Well of course they did, but of course they adored that, they liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Then they had open fires you know, in the evening, and they sang songs, and these little Polish boys, well they would -- when they came, I was told, they would -- they would -- they didn’t speak any German, and so they would slowly be taught by the other children, who were absolutely charming to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">It was -- it was strange, because I knew that I was -- I was seeing something that one would t -- y -- di -- you know, that one should really, you know, hate, because it was -- it was [indecipherable] being hateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And not at all, they were all terribly nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">You know, life was more complex then. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Primo Levi wrote in one of his books that --

QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Gitta Sereny. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Sorry, you were saying Primo Levi.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  Yes, but I can’t -- I can’t remember unfortunately, the exact quote, so I’m -- I’m not saying that ’'m quoting him verbatim, but he said something about that nothing in these situations was black and white, it was all gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And that is, you know, the fantastic lesson that those of us who really worked with this -- with this -- these DPs, and with these children and -- and with the Germans who -- who -- who had these children, and all the rest of it, you know -- and then with the Polish parents -- oh God almighty, the Polish parents, who of course, you know, they -- I was coming to that, but I’m -- it was -- it was all gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">There was no -- there was nobody who was terrible, or who was -- who was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">It wasn’t really like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They were just ordinary, really, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But everybody -- that’s the extraordinary thing, everybody was capable of love for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It was certainly true of all the parents I met, and I certainly met -- I would have thought, at least a hundred couples who had such children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  You know, I really don’t envy you this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Did you actually have to remove children from one set of --

<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  -- parents and deliver them to --
ANSWER:  Yeah, we did, yeah, terrible, terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">But thank God I didn’t have to do it often. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I mean thank God by that time I was promoted and you know, this was left to -- oh, this -- I was able to you know, peop -- other people could do this, so I didn’t have to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It was a terrible thing, terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">It was a terr -- and -- and you know, one didn’t know what was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">One really didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I mean, I cannot tell you how many cases there were where I -- I really wondered whether I was doing the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Should they not be staying with these -- particularly the little ones, should they not be staying with these parents they adored, who adored them? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">They were children who had never learned any language except German. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">They knew nothing about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And what was going to meet them when they went back? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And that’s what I found out of course, when I took that one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">It was -- you know, it was a -- a traumatic experience, because the -- the -- the -- the children were isolated from these parents, who were expecting them with open -- oops, sorry --
QUESTION:  That’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">ANSWER:  -- with open arms, and with open emotions and with -- you know, it was all so emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And- and the children could not give. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">They couldn’t give what these parents wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And when these parents took them in their arms, the children shied away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It was absolutely terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And there was one -- I mean, there was -- I -- I made one trip afterwards, and went back to three of these couples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  I went back to three, I couldn’t do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">But I went back to three of the couples. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">In only one of them it had worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And I was told that it hardly worked in any of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  When you say worked, I mean, the children run away, or --
ANSWER:  The children -- no, the chil -- the children ran away, the children were traumatized, the children wer -- were doing terribly badly at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the children were -- were -- were naughty, were -- were violent, were everything you -- every problem that we know that children have, they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">The children wanted back. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I mean the two of the ones where I went, of the three, the children told me where they want back, they wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they hated <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they hated every minute they had spent there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">They couldn’t get on with anybody, the language 1s horrible, their language is German. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">They didn’t like the music, and you know, Polish music is beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">They didn’t like the music, they didn’t like anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And I said, “You’re being totally,” -- these were older -- these two were older. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I said, “You’re being totally negative, this 1s, you know, quite wrong, you’re not helping.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="782">We are too young to help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Quite right, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">They were too young to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">It was asking too much of children, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  So what was -- what was the effect on you of having to, you know, witness these ghastly things, and do these pretty ghastly jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  Well, you -- you say ghastly, but of course, you know, they weren’t ghastly at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I mean, the problems were terrible, but you know, we are -- we are -- if we are adults, you know, if we are adults, and I of course, became adult very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And if you are -- in particular if you are -- were also a man, it’s -- I was just going to say particularly if you are a girl, but it’s not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I mean, I -- we -- I had colleagues, particularly if I think of this Australian I have already mentioned, you know, who had exactly the same, if you like, gifts that I had, which was A, to be able to see both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , which is very important, cause it’s the only way to be -- to maintain some kind of objectivity or neutrality, is to be able to see both sides of each question. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">But also who -- you a -- you know, who had the kind of need to give to children. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">This is one of the things that you really needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">You needed to be the kind of person -- I mean, if you were a child welfare officer in <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , you needed to be the kind of person who needed to give to children. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Of course, if I turn this on, it won’t come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I have to turn it on over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  Don’t worry, Pll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Let me --
ANSWER:  No, no, it has to be over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  Pll go over there [tape break] ... ask you about the German NS trials and what -- what it was like to be there, and --
ANSWER:  Well, sure, I don’t know what to say about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I mean, I went to so many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  Why did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  Well I -- I really went because I was very interested, but also because I was working for the “Daily Telegraph Magazine” at the time, and they had a wonderful editor there, I wrote about him, John Anstey, and -- and he was very interested in this problem, and so he -- he backed me, you know, he backed me for all these things, and you -- you had to have somebody like that if you were going to go do -- you know, I mean I -- I went to these trials for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So of course he -- he paid all the expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I mean, you can imagine what that costs. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Not to speak of my time, but he didn’t pay much for that, I’ve got to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">QUESTION:  But you went backwards and forwards, or you stayed there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  Yeah -- no, no, I's -- I would stay for -- for weeks and come back, which was not very good for my family, I mean it was -- it’s terrible what one does to one’s family, really, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">One thinks that this is all so important, but of course, as I found out later, I mean it certainly -- I -- I -- [ -- it was not very good for my boy, who was, of course, in <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , but I mean, even so, it was not good for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">He didn’t see very much of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Well, anyway -- but these trials were, of course, fascinating, and it was fascinating to write about them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And I learned an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But what -- what was most important to me in the end was that -- that it was not through trials that one could find out what these people were about, because trials are limited in what they can find out, however good the prosecutor is, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And this -- it happened to be the one -- the one who was involved in most of these trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> was a very, very good prosecutor called Alfred Spiess, who became a great friend of mine, at last he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">But he -- he was a -- a very bright man, and he tried in fact, to enlarge these questions, too, because he also wanted to know, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But he had to find out that it was simply not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I mean, the <span class="INT_SPACE">courtroom</span> does not lend itself to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So this 1s where I really got the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Wit -- no, it wasn’t where I got the idea, but certainly where the idea strengthened in my mind that -- that I wanted to find somebody I could talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">One of these people who -- cause most of them, you see, just said they were not guilty, they -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they were acting under orders, which is true of course, they were acting under orders and they -- they couldn’t have done anything but what they did, which of course is not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">But that’s all they -- that’s all, really, one got out of most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I was looking for one where there was -- there was some remnant of conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I can’t tell you how difficult that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I mean, all the trials I saw, the one I found, finally found Stangl, was the only one And Spiess said the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">He may -- he -- you know, brought my attention to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span> , he really presented him to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He -- he phoned me and said, “Look, I think I’ve now got the man here in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">You must come very quickly.” </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And so I took the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , and went to the trial, to the Stangl trial, which went on for 10 months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  Was this 1970?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  It was 1969, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  °69.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I’m not absolutely sure about that, but I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Anyway, it’s in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And you know, after one day of sitting there, I knew that -- that -- that Spiess had hit the nail on the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">This was a slightly different man. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It was -- the degree was very small, how he was different, but there was just -- there was a sadness about Stangl, which I had not found in any of the others, and which Spiess had not found in any of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">They were arrogant, they were hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">They were proud of what they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Stangl was not proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And quite aside from that, he was sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And I thought, if he was capable of being sad, unless we find out that it’s only about his situation, if he was capable of being sad about the whole thing, then there was that remnant of conscience, which of course I did find in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Took me a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Took me a very long time to find it, but I did find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And he was the right choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I mean, I couldn’t have done this with -- with any of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I met several of the others before, and of course after I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And -- and tried to talk to them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And only one of I met, who -- but he was not -- he was just not as intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I mean, Stangl was not very intelligent, but he was more intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And in fact, if he hadn’t been more intelligent, he wouldn’t have been given the job he was given. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I mean, he was a -- he had an enormous job. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I mean, commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , you could not have a bigger job in that branch of the SS or Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">It was impossible to have a bigger job. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So of course he had the qualifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">He was a brilliant organizer, which is what was mostly needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And -- and he was a -- he was a man, in a way -- don’t misunderstand it, but he -- he was a man in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He was not a drunkard, he didn’t play around with women. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">He didn’t, of course, didn’t gamble, or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And he was not a man given to violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So there were four things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who appointed him saw just as much as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I mean, they had him first -- his first assignment, his first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course, an Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wels</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">He was a provincial. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And his first assignment as a police officer, was to become the police head of <span class="BUILDING">Schloss Hartheim</span> , which was a euthanasia institute. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Bad enough, God knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And there -- and th-these <span class="BUILDING">euthanasia institutes</span> , where they appointed 96 SS people to become either heads or, you know, or officials there. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Always in higher positions, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually Baltics. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">They could, of course observe and -- and see these quote, qualities, unquote, which I have mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Because already in the <span class="BUILDING">euthanasia institute</span> , I mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualities. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And so he was -- he was predestined to be promoted, there’s no doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And then he -- he -- he got these two jobs, first at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , as a kind of preparation, which he opened, which he started, built. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And then of course, the worst one of them all, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , I mean that was the worst <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Oh, I don’t know whether any of them were worse than any other. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I mean, the -- that’s -- they -- they were <span class="NPIP">places</span> , you know, which only existed for killing, I mean, they were not for anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Which probably it’s -- it’s too extraordinary that -- that -- that 60 years later you have the same misapprehension, or miscomprehension of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , which ha -- which existed then. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I mean, even now, again, this book I’ve just finished reading, which is about to come out in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I mean again, I mean these <span class="NPIP">places</span> are -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> is conc -- 1s -- is described as an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I mean, total nonsense, you know, it’s full of total nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The -- the whole problem, which has been written about more than any other -- what, any other event in history, this extermination of the Jews, I mean it’s -- really, it’s -- it’s ust incredible the number of books and -- and essays, and newspaper a -- films, what -- what have you, which have been done on this subject, and still people don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Too extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Anyway, there were only -- there were only four of such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , which were only there for exterminating people, that nobody spent a night there, nobody had a meal there. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Nobody washed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They came in, they were killed,

<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  The thing is that death was so obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">You see, it is -- I mean, they say now that these people didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Well, of course they didn’t know when they arrived, but my God, within minutes, within seconds they knew, because the work Jews told them at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">They had not even got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And if -- if -- if the work Jews saw somebody they liked, whose looks they liked, or who smiled at them even, I mean the smallest thing could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">They would say don’t do that, don’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Say you are that, say you are this, when you are asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Behave like this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They would whisper to them, in whatever language, you know, communication -- they could communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And they saved lives that way, of course.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Was it with the help of the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  -- I'd have the -- well, no, no, he didn’t escape with the help of the aust -- I mean he -- he escaped with his own -- you know, by his own intelligence, but he -- he -- he esca -- he used the <span class="DLF">Vatican escape route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">There was an Austrian -- an Austrian bishop, whose name I’ve now forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">You know, it’s impossible to -- to keep all these names in one’s mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">But anyway, whose name I have now forgotten, but this bishop was the link man for this so-called <span class="DLF">Vatican escape route</span> , and had also the means -- I mean, was able to provide them with the means -- that is, Red Cross passports, and things like this, which they had to have because they had to cross <span class="DLF">borders</span> , you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  And they had to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I mean, they have to get <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> if they were going to get anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And this is certainly what happened in Stangl’s case. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I mean, he was -- he was -- he went to this, he heard about this bishop, he went to him, he -- the bishop kept him there for a wh- a few days, to let him rest and to -- and to prepare the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And then he gave him the papers he needed, gave him some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And of course this is a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing, but there you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">The <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> did many terrible things, they did many not terrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">It’s -- again, it’s a gray area. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Again, nothing is black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">You know, and they were wonderful people, they were nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I mean, God almighty, what the nuns did in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">You know, the number of people they hid, children. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">They hid Jewish children, but not you f -- for -- for a night or for a week, but for months, months. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And you -- you have to try and imagine what it’s like to live in a Nazi country, and to hide a number of Jewish grown-ups, Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">It -- 1t -- it -- I mean -- you know, death was always around the corner, I mean just around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And the Nazis had absolutely no reason to -- to -- to spare a nun. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">They disliked the nuns as much as they dus -- disliked anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They disliked the Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So, 1t was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So if -- if we say, you know, that like this bishop, he ju -- he was doing terrible things by saving people such as Stangl, yes he did, he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But just at the same time, there were wonderful people who saved people. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And it is absolutely true that this bishop, of course, did not know what Stangl had done, because of course, he wasn’t told. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They were very careful not to tell him what these individuals had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Would he have helped him anyway? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I think he would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Because A, I think he was a Nazi, and B, he was not a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I think he would have, but purely factually, he did not know who these people were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  Stangl was finally tracked down where, in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Was he brought back --
ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , he was tracked down -- he was tracked down in fact -- well, Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal said he tracked him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Stang] said this was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">But you know, are we going to believe Stang] rather than Simon Wiesenthal, it’s very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">It’s a very complicated story how he was tracked down, and it -- and I think that actually Wiesenthal did have a hand in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I don’t think he actually discovered him, but he had a hand in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  What persuaded Stang] to sit down and talk to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  I tell you something, I think all -- all people want to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Except me, I’m not very eager to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">But then, I really have nothing to hide, I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">But all these people who lived hidden lives, they all wanted to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I think that basically, I mean, if you want to talk ab -- if you want to consider this from a human point of -- or a humane point of view, I think they were all very lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">You know, most of them were separated by <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and other, from their families, their wives, their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I mean, certainly in Stangl’s case this was so. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Saw themselves sentenced, if not to death, because the death penalty had been abolished, but certainly to life in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">You know, and they were young, I mean, they were not old men. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Stangl, I can’t remember how old he was, but he was certainly not more than what, 35 or 38, I mean he was -- he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And the earliest he could have got out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> -- this is -- he was sentenced to life imprisonment, was when he was 60. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Now just imagine a life like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Well, I mean, course criminals, you know, we know this, this happens to -- to many criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">But of course, he didn’t consider himself a criminal, not until after he talked to me that he began to see what the rest of us thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">However, there were other reasons why he -- I think, why he -- at wa -- he talked -- he started to agree to talk to me because his appeal was going to come up, and he thought that I was going to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Now, I -- I -- I -- I -- ’d disabused him of this idea, because I had told him immediately that I would not help, and that what I would write would do absolutely nothing toward helping his appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">But that if he talked to me, and if he talked to me fully, I would write everything he said, everything for, everything against, whatever he said, I would write it. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And by this time there was the other element, which was A, Stangl -- you have to understand this, Stangl was an Austrian, this why I immediately said he was a provincial Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And we talked to, in my kind of German, which is of course upper class German, we talked to by a young woman, which I was at the time -- I mean, a youngish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">A youngish woman, you know, a -- somebody who represented something. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">A lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">He’d never met a lady in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And suddenly there was this lady who was willing to talk to him, and listen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">This was extraordinary for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">It’s very hard to explain this to people who don’t know Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">You know, who don’t know what a provincial Austrian is, or Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">It’s very much the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And I think that this weighed as heavily finally, as anythi --

ANSWER:  It was a kind of an honor, and the -- the director of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , whose name is Mies, and who is a really good man, very good wife, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I saw a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And he said that -- he went to see Stangl quite often, quite often in the evening after he had talked to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And Stangl was in a State of -- this was such an experience for him, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And he would start talking about, you know, the way I asked him questions and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And he would tell him that -- that, you know, she asked me -- he would tell Mies that, well [inaudible] I was the countess, of course, yeah -- what can I do? “</span><span class="sentence" id="1003">You know,” he said, “the countess asks me such difficult questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">They are really very, very difficult, but she asks them in such a way, you know, that I- I feel I -- nots -- not that I can, I must answer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">It’s wonderful, I mean it’s -- it’s really wonderful, but it’s -- it’s -- you know, I’ve said this to lots and lots of young journalists, who of course, I mean, would love to do this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">But honestly you have to -- you -- you really have to think whether you can confront people like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And whether you can be -- it’s very difficult -- whether you can remain -- not just pretend, that’s easy, but inside yourself, retain some kind of objectivity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">ANSWER:  Of course she had the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">She had the power, and you know what her power was, a -- her sex was the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">They were two people who were sexually so attuned to each other, and so important to each other, that the relationship was three quarters sexual, and one quarter whatever else there is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">In most our relationships with our husbands, you know, it’s the other way -- it becomes to be the other way around, because you can’t maintain this sexual excitement, you know, for more than what, three years? </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I mean, that’s already extraordinary if you maintain it for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Afterwards, well, it’s -- sex is part of it, but it’s a tiny part of a re -- a relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">A relationship is -- is friendship, is love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And their love was very sexual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And had she been a better woman, a stronger woman, and not just a -- a devout Catholic, as the book says you must be a devout Catholic, that’s all she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">She could have used that sex to get him out of it, because she should have known that even according to her own religion, which she so -- you know, so devoutly believed in, he was going to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And she allowed him to be lost.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I think that if you -- if -- 1f you have a very strong sexual relationship with a man, you already know that you have the power, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Or, if you have love, and even if you don’t have that sexual relationship any more, you know what the love means to the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And what the withdrawal of such love would mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">No, no, no, women are very powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">I’m not saying all women are equally powerful, but women on the whole, are very powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And if they don’t use this power for the good, their own good, their husband’s good, ha -- their children’s good, then they are despicable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Much more despicable than men, who are very often quite weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Stangl was certainly weak, I mean there’s no doubt about it, he was weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Which is one of the reasons, probably why he did what he did, cause it made him feel strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I mean, it was incredible to be -- can you imagine what it is like to be in the position where you are the -- the -- the -- the -- the god over life and death, not just of a few people, but of hundred thousands of people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I mean, 1-is it imaginable?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">ANSWER:  Why did he do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And I think he did it because yes, it made him feel strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">He knew of his weakness, and he had to be strong, because his wife, who was more important to him than life, really, could not love a weak man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">So you see, he accepted a job in the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">You remember, accepted a job in the police, that was when he was a very young man, and he -- he was a weaver by profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Gave that up, went into the police, why did he go in the police? </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I asked him why, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And he said, “Oh, you know, they had these wonderful uniforms, and they were so important.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">That’s where it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And the m -- you know, the further he went, then the euthanasia, for God’s sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I mean, think of the importance -- how important he was in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were murdering -- we call it murder, they of course, didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Mercy killing they called it, which is not something that is completely strange to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  Is that what he called it still when he spoke to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  Absolutely, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">He said you cannot -- you -- you find this in there, he wa -- you cannot imagine what they were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">You cannot imagine when they arrived, what they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">QUESTION:  Well of course I can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I mean, I have been in insane asylums. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I have been in many <span class="BUILDING">handicapped institutions</span> -- in-institutions for the handicapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And the -- it can be terrible, and if you are uninterested, or if you are not capable of -- of communicating, if you like, 1-<span class="NPIP">inside</span> , with the -- the spirit of these people, of such people -- and you know with -- with many insane, you cannot communicate, but with the handicapped, you can communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">But if you are incapable of it, and only see these totally destroyed bodies, which is very often the case, well then you -- you know then of course you will think they would be better off dead, as one of the nuns he talked to, a Mother Superior said she felt they were better off <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in -- dead in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Well of course she would feel that, wouldn’t she? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">No, not of course, but it is understandable that she might. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">But think what science, what our -- what our generation -- and I know nothing about this, you know, because I am not a scientist, I am not a mathematician, I -- it’s simply not my thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">But what would our generation have done without Stephen Hawking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And here is a man whose body is totally destroyed, and whose spirit is totally there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Now what -- what -- can you imagine what the Nazis would have done to Stephen Hawking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I mean, people should think that way.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  And of course Stangl would have thought that 1t was a mercy to kill Stephen Haw -- Stephen Hawking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Because he would never, never have been capable of seeing that spirit, of feeling that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">QUESTION:  And what did he feel at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , what did he come to feel, if anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">ANSWER:  At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , well that was different, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I mean, this -- the -- one -- one cannot for a moment forget the pre -- you know, conditioning all these Austrians and Germans -- mostly Austrians by the way, who were the supervisors of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I mean, their -- their -- you know, their preconditioning was the most extreme that you can think of -- which ended, of course, if you like, or it began with the euthanasia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But -- but -- by the time they were sent to the <span class="BUILDING">euthanasia institutions</span> , th -- the -- the authorities knew that they were capable of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">QUESTION:  How do you test these people, before he goes, say to that <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1101">ANSWER:  He was -- he was a bl -- I mean, I was absolutely convinced from what he told me, that he wa- that he was, you know, even before he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to talk to psychiatrists, which they did before he was assigned to the euthanasia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">But even before that, they -- of course they observed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">They observed him in his police work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">He said they couldn’t have observed me, because I didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">You don’t have to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">The question is how you behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">How you talk to your superiors, or to your comrades, or to those you arrest, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">There are a million ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I mean, you can do this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">You can talk, you can find out -- I mean, you could -- you could -- you could talk to different police officers here, and after half an hour, you, for instance, you would know what they were about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And I would know what they were about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">You know, it’s -- it’s -- 1t’s impossible to hide if you are a certain kind of person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">QUESTION:  But there must be a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I mean, there must be a -- th -- th --
ANSWER:  I’m not saying that every police officer --
QUESTION:  No, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">ANSWER:  -- but I don’t mean that at all, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">QUESTION:  No, but there must -- must have been something in him that -- you know, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was so special, and so awful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  Yeah, but there were 96 SS men, young men like he, and even younger, who were part of this, in these four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">96 of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">QUESTION:  How old was he when he became commandant, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">ANSWER:  I don’t remember, no, but it’s in the book, I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I don’t remember how old he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">QUESTION:  And how did you bring yourself day after day to go back and listen, and probe, and --
ANSWER:  Oh, but -- but -- but listen, this was fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Let’s not forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I mean, first of all I was doing something -- and I really don’t mean this in any, you know, in any journalistic way, but I mean it was something that hadn’t been done before, and that needed to be done, to my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  And I was -- I was getting -- very slowly getting a feel of -- of -- you know, of the thing that I was looking for, very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Took a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  How long did you spend with him in all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  I spent three weeks with him, every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And then I went back and spent another week with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So all together I spent four weeks with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">But this -- these were long days, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I mean, I came there at nine in the morning, stayed until half past 12, I think it was, came back at a half past one, and stayed until five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Now -- during which time he talked all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1135">QUESTION:  What is it that’s kind of burned itself into your mind of -- of what he told you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">What are the images, or the particular stories that you can’t forget?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">ANSWER:  Well, first, no -- I do -- I can’t tell the stories, but I mean what -- what set -- burnt itself into my mind at first, and which has been confirmed by -- you know, by -- by many other talks I’ve had with people such as Stangl, 1s their self pity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I mean, first there is the self pity which is perfectly justified, about their childhoods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Every one of them had a terrible childhood, I mean it’s extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">It’s extraordinary, I’m -- I’m horrified at the number of terrible childhoods there are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And it’s true, you know, because I looked into it afterwards in each case, and I found out, absolutely confirmed, beaten, all the rest of it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Absolutely true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And -- and these children are conditioned, for God’s sake, for violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">You be violent with a child, and the child in conditioned toward violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I’m not saying that every child that is beaten as a child is going to become a Stangl, of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">But if the circumstances are created, where becoming a Stangl, or something like that, is admirable in the eyes of the community, that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">That’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And- and for Stang] this was exactly it, I mean it was admirable what he was doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  So from what you tell me, I mean there 1s no sense of, you know, being when you -- you’re in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with Stangl, of being in the presence of evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">You’re in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a provincial Austrian policeman who got lucky, or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  No, you’re in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a -- it’s not -- that’s too simple, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And you’re just saying this to draw me out, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">But of course it’s too simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">You can never simplify somebody like Stangl, you can say -- I can say here is just a provincial Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Of course he was just a convincial -- provincial Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">But he was a provincial Austrian who went through a series of experiences which burned itself into his spirit, and corrupted him totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">He was a totally corrupt man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">A man who should never have been allowed again into the presence of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Which is what his wife felt, eventually, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I mean -- and -- and I’m not even saying that -- you know, I’m not even saying that you can blame only Stangl for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">You have to blame -- you have to blame the whole -- the circumstances, and the environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So the people who created this environment, are of course as blameworthy as Stangl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Do you see what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I mean, of course Stangl, had he had the right help from his wife, he could have got out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">But it would have been difficult, and demanded, you know, character. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I mean, the kind of character he didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I mean the kind of civic courage that he didn’t have, and also some conviction of sorts that he didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">For instance, the conviction that no one person, because he was Jewish, is bad, rather than another person is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I mean, it -- it simply -- thi -- thi -- this is -- the moment this division exists in the person, where to him, you know, where a Russian 1s bad, and an Englishman is good -- I mean, this is total bullshit of course, total nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And the moment you feel anything like that, which is one of the dangers of war by the way, you’re lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">QUESTION:  What was the experience like for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Apart -- you’ve said that it was fascinating, but when you open that <span class="DLF">door</span> every morning, okay you’re fascinated, and you want to know, and you’re getting somewhere, and --
ANSWER:  No, but it’s not okay you’re fascinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">I mean the fascination is -- you know, the intellectual challenge is tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I mean, it’s a tremendous -- I mean it’s like -- it’s like alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">ANSWER:  You know, it’s a tremendous thing, in which -- which 1s -- which was one thing with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span> where I was -- where I was -- the one thing I was worried about, about myself with these conversations with Stangl, is that I was constantly the superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">This is very dangerous for anyone’s character. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">It’s very bad for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And I was lucky enough that, you know, I had this wonderful family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I had the counterweight of my extremely intelligent husband, and you know, very intelligent children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So not -- I’m saying intelligent because you know, you feel that you are so much in command, that your brain is more in your mind than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I mean, there were moments when I -- I -- I knew I couldn’t go on, and I then could go on, because that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But -- but it was very different, of course, when I undertook this thing with sha -- with Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">Because Speer was not just my equal, but he was way superior to me in intellect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">He was far more cultivé than -- than I was at the time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">He had read far more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">He -- he -- he was a -- an absolutely extraordinary man, and so it -- it was a completely different challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">QUESTION:  Tell me a little about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Let’s move on to Speer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1190">ANSWER:  Well, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn’t like when he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I mean, he got in touch with me having read, “Into That Darkness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And obviously -- I mean, as I said before, these people want to speak, they want to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And Speer read, “Into That Darkness,” which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the <span class="REGION">western world</span> , tried to talk to Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I mean, it would have been insane not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I didn’t like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I thought he was an arrogant man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">His charm did not charm me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I thought his -- he was very suave, and I couldn’t bear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So when he -- when he wrote to me, and then followed this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- I was very reluctant indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">He became -- he became very atta -- not attached, that’s the wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very much, already on the telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I mean, they had these long conversations on art, about which Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">But also, Don knows far more than I, but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- and it was quite interesting for my husband, you know, who was still very actively on “Vogue,” and doing lots of photography, also to do with artists and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">So it was all very interesting for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1208">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1209">ANSWER:  And he -- he didn’t like Speer very much, any more than I did, but -- on the phone, I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1210">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">ANSWER:  But somehow a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, something -- I don’t know how many weeks it was, it was several weeks of these phone calls which came in from Speer, all asking me, well when would I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , and I mean wasn’t I planning? </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I was so often in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , wasn’t I -- blah, blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And finally I thought, what is the matter with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a Stangl on him, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">I'll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I’ve got to say, I mean really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> [indecipherable], and there was this humble man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">On the telephone he was just as arrogant as on TV. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So every tra - telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I’m all wrong about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">What is this man, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">What is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I said, “Jesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn’t think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Don said, “Oh yes, you’re crazy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">So -- so anyway, that’s how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one’s attitude changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Once -- as I told you, once- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I know that this is a -- a cliché thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it’s not Freudian, it’s -- it’s purely human. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">It doesn’t apply to everybody either, I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Because you can have a rotten childhood, or a difficult childhood, and still become a perfectly ordinary and good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">So it doesn’t apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And certainly with Speer there were very, very strong connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">He was extraordinary lonely as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">He was very alone throughout his childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So when he found Hitler, of course 1t must have been the most extraordinary experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And a son who had never had a father, found a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">It’s as simple as that, really, except it’s much more complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">But start with the simple things, and you find answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">They loved each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And he never, never understood it really, until he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> , and was alone, and could read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">You know, he read 5,000 books in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And boy, he could read, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">He really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">But he was not an ideological anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">He could manage with anybody, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> , I mean my God, I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> he -- you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> he had a -- a great deal to do with -- with Jewish officers, and actually had -- I mean, he even emotionally changed a lot there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">People, that it’s not -- it’s not where they come from, it -- but what they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Which is the only thing that counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I mean, it doesn’t matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">It’s -- it’s totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that’s what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And he did, I mean he -- he- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And he was so right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">QUESTION:  But thi -- and this is -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
