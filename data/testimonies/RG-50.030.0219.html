<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Drexel Andreas Sprecher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born 1n Independence, <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> , on March 25th, 1913.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your childhood and your growing up, will you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, I grew up in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then I went away to a small <span class="BUILDING">college</span> for 1 year and then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> for 3 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> , I ran onto a number of religious leaders who I got close to. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">There had been some anti-Semitic incidents on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> and I was asked if I would form a group to kind of neutralize this since I was on the basketball team and a few other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So we formed a group called "KOINOS" from the Greek word, in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And that group put on some seminars and we let it be known that we weren't going to have any more incidences around the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> or some of us would respond in kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I became very interested through a number of professors in what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I wrote a thesis for Professor Selig Perlman on the nature and structure of German Fascism. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I didn't know too much about it but I had a book by Professor Schuman at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> whereupon I applied to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> for a fellowship with Schuman which I was granted where my professors at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and Glenn Frank, the President of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , said if you can afford it, you should go abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So I said I can afford it, and I went abroad to the London School of Economics, a part of the <span class="BUILDING">University of London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And there I actually knew I wasn't going to stay 2 years so I could get a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Instead I did a lot of traveling and a lot of talking and a lot of writing as a young person who is having a whole new world opening to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And then I was persuaded that my unruly mind needed some discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I should go to <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and saw Professor Felix Frankfurter. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He said I think you have the qualifications to be admitted, and I was admitted the next month to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And while at the <span class="BUILDING">Law School</span> I didn't do too well except that I organized the Harvard Law School Union and became its first president. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I became very active in working with campus groups getting speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I became a member of the Ford Hall Youth Forum Directorate under David Niles, who was head of the Ford Hall Forum in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And so there's the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  You had told me earlier you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the early 30s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> first in about 1929 with my parents, as a part of a European trip of about 6 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we went to the Passion Play, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberamegau</span> and a few things in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but mainly we spent our time in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  And you went again in '35?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, when I went...after I graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and to the London School of Economics and to spend most of '34 and '35 over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  What did you see in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time, you didn't see too much on the surface except that the things were highly regimented. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">By the time I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the consolidation of power by the Nazis had well taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">However, I did get there in time to have a big tour of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span> , because one of the German students, his father was the Director of the Gutehoffnungshuete asked me to visit with their family and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And then I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for the Goering- Sonnemann wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He married...Goering married a movie actress by the name of Sonnemann, Emmy Sonnemann and I went and stood on the curb side behind four rows of storm troopers and saw Hitler lead the parade and Goering down to the Dom’, where he was married and back from the Dom and I took a picture upside down which I still have, which shows Hitler in the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> behind Goering and Sonnemann.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  As the war approached, you were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">You were finishing up <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">What kinds of things did you start getting involved in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, as soon as I was out of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in 1938 my law club had won the Ames Competition which is the moot court arguments. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And what we argued about was a case that was before the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , and so our briefs were used by the Department of Justice as well as the National Labor Relations Board in the arguments before the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And when I came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> looking for a job, I was...was interested in one of two jobs, either with the Labor Board or with the Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I stopped at the Labor Board first and I was hired in the first half hour, so I didn't go to the Department of Justice for an interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  How did...from the Labor Board, how did you come involved in...as the war drew...drew closer in the war itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Well, actually the work at the Labor Board I was in the Trial Section which I wanted to be in, and I was sent around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on first easier cases and then more difficult ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I got a lot of trial experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And then I wound up finally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at the time the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I enlisted and since I had been in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they shipped me right to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a Sergeant without any basic training or anything like that and assigned me to the Inspector General. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Traveled all over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="REGION">Northern Ireland</span> for up until after the invasion, the Allies invaded <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And then like a good Inspector General, I came down a month ‘German: <span class="BUILDING">Cathedral</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Referring in this instance specifically to the <span class="BUILDING">Cathedral</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">later and spent the next nearly the next year in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> inspecting installations. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And from there, I worked into OSS, which 1s another story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit because it is relevant...a little bit about what you did in OSS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Well, my...an old friend from the Labor Board was Gerhard Van Arkel, and he was one of the assistants of Arthur Goldberg, who was then a Major and the head of the German Labor Desk of OSS. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And Van Arkel came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oran</span> which is my base in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> , and tried to persuade me for some time to come with OSS as a training officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Well, we finally worked it so that I could get there because I...my boss didn't want to let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> and I worked with about 12 or 13 Germans who had fought in with the Loyalists in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> against the Dictator Franco, or the upcoming Dictator Franco, and of course, that helped solidify too my feelings and about things in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and gave me more information about how OSS operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I met Wild Bill, General Wild Bill Donovan’ at that time, but never knew him well. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And at a certain point Arthur Goldberg asked me to come back and be the Director of Training for the German-Labor Desk in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I did that and when the...looked like the war was winding down a good deal, I moved over to the Labor Branch of the Department of the Army because there were tremendous manpower shortages in various industries: aluminum, forge and foundry work, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And while I was working on that along came VE Day and Justice Jackson, meanwhile, had been appointed Chief of Counsel for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ’ and I came back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and he made his first report to President Truman. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was terribly impressed by what he'd...what he reported on and I made up my mind that somehow I was going to get on Justice Jackson's staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I didn't know Justice Jackson, but I did know David K. Niles, who was an assistant to the President, and he sent a ...a letter recommending me to Justice Jackson, but nothing ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Meanwhile, I thought that might be the case, so I went back to OSS, to the General Counsel's office’, and told him that I would like to work on the trials, and he told me that OSS was actually furnishing most of the data for Justice Jackson because the Department of Justice had very little and our War Department had very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And he said, "But in our files, the research and analysis here, we have something about practically everything that's happened in Nazi Germany.” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I said, "Fine.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And so for the next month or so, I just studied those files like a trooper. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">A professor by the name of Franz Neumann wrote a book called Behemoth’, was there and he gave me some tips on different things to do and when he found out I was interested in the Trade Union Movement, he gave me a book in which the Nazis bragged *The Head of OSS. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Information supplied by interviewee. “</span><span class="sentence" id="70">Justice Robert Jackson was appointed represent the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the <span class="BUILDING">War Crimes Tribunal</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="71">Information supplied by interviewee. ) “</span><span class="sentence" id="72">Commander James Donovan. (</span><span class="sentence" id="73">Information supplied by interviewee). ’</span><span class="sentence" id="74">The full title is Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Information supplied by interviewee. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">about how they'd taken over the trade unions. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And they included the...a copy of the order in the appendix that they'd sent out to the SA...the storm troops in order to seize these trade union leaders and the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of all the unions on the 2nd of May 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Well, this gave me a tremendous basis for beginning to write a brief, which I did, and submitted it to several people, including Jackson. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And they were quite impressed that I had gotten this much...this kind of material without even getting into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So that's how I got started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Why don't you pick it up from there and tell us about indeed going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and beginning the first research 1n the first work before the trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in July of 1939 -- I'm sorry, 1945, and met some of the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I could tell that a lot of them had gotten so accustomed to being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> that they weren't anxious to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But Colonel Storey’, the head of the Documentation Division, had already established <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I tried...I persuaded them to let me get there as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in July of 1945, the Rosenberg files had just been brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rue de Pressbourg</span> which was the headquarters of the <span class="BUILDING">OSS office</span> there and now became the head of the Chief of Counsel War Crimes office.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So here I saw all these volumes. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Some of them had still had hay sticking out of them or straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Uh...Rosenberg had buried these files behind a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> , but some German had seen him do it and reported it to an Allied officer, an American officer and the American officer told us, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So they were brought in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">There were few people to work on those files. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And Colonel Storey didn't speak any German and he had gotten from the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> and so on, a few people who are...spoke German, and they'd begun. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But he said out of the Rosenberg, what they producing out of the Rosenberg files is a tremendous number...amount of materials on slave labor and spoilation and the stealing of art treasures and all this kind of thing, but they haven't produced anything that directly ties them to aggressive war. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I wish you'd tackle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So that was my first day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And that night after dinner, I came back and gazed at this files. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And they were all thick Leitz Orners® about 3 inches thick, except one which was about an inch thick or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And that had on the back of it Norwegen APA--<span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , Foreign Political Office, Auslandspolitischesamt, and I just figured that was easier to tackle than any big volume. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So I pulled it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I started to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Now, let's see, there was a Quisling. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And Vidkun Quisling, and he became a collaborator. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Let's see when was <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> invaded? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">June 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So I went to that period in this file, and I looked before it and here there was memos about Vidkun Quisling bringing 12 Germans 1n to see Rosenberg in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and eventually Quisling had been introduced to Hitler in a brief conversation and that then you go in back and had helped in the invasion...the Nazi invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I immediately went *Colonel Robert G. Storey. (</span><span class="sentence" id="107">Information supplied by interviewee). "</span><span class="sentence" id="108">Rue de Pressbourg was converted into the <span class="BUILDING">Paris branch office</span> for the U.S. Chief of Council for War Crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Information supplied by the interviewee. “</span><span class="sentence" id="110">Notebooks. (</span><span class="sentence" id="111">Information supplied by interviewee.) </span><span class="sentence" id="112">in to Story the next morning and told him, "Here's what I've got.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And I had already written a very brief one-page memo on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I said, "Now my German isn't very good, so I'm not going to be able to vouch for all these, but I think you might just take this file to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> the next day on Justice Jackson's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">private plane</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that the Army had assigned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He took that file back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and, of course, immediately it was on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> of everybody with respect to what had been found. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And this is how I made my first impression on Jackson. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And then I also showed him this brief that I had done and told him that it needed filling in as soon as I could get into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he said, "Well, I think we better hurry you along.” </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, well, meanwhile I had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I hadn't gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> because we didn't know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was going to be the head of the trials in July. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But I had gone in and made a few contacts and knew that some contacts that would be helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">On August 15th, by that time the London agreement had been signed establishing the Tribunal and Office Chief of War Crimes as the main representative of the American...the Americans and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then Major Baldwin, who is Colonel Storey's deputy, and I flew in in order to open the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And we came into this bombed and shelled, huge <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Justice</span> as it was called out on the <span class="DLF">Fuertherstrasse</span> , and the first thing we had to do is the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had been broken in from shelling and bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> itself was only had been hit in a couple of <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It wasn't too badly full of debris except in one or two <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had come in and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were all dirty, and there was dust on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And what I did was get a bunch of SS men from a nearby incarceration spot or <span class="BUILDING">detention center</span> and we used these OSS men in order to clean up the <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Justice</span> , in order to make room for the trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  When did you start begin...to begin the interrogations and the preparations for the trials? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">How did that begin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Well, I began preparations for the trial back in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because of the materials that OSS had. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And that would have been in...in June of 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  But here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">By the time you got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you were doing what now? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You had opened this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">What were you doing there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Well, by the time I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I already had connections to a lot of the heads of trade unions who had been put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> early 1n the war, or early in the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I started traveling around in order to get affidavits from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And in the process of getting that, I also got materials covering Gypsies and Jews to some extent, although that wasn't my <span class="DLF">field</span> , main field of operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And then I started and when we got we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , some more people came in and I was assigned a German refugee by the name of Norbert Heilpern He spoke very good German and a broken English, but he was...and incidently, he'd been a soldier in World War I on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> , and so it was often interesting and he'd often put on a little act for us at parties we had where he'd play the Prussian soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But with his help, I managed to get the idea behind many documents which were later introduced in the trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I could make a case that they ought to be translated by experts in the language division. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And from that I...I built a brief on the destruction of the trade unions and the building of the German Labor Front by the defendant Ley. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I...it was pretty well understood that I was going to prosecute Robert Ley, the head of the German Labor Front, whereupon he committed suicide upon his indictment, which ended my first defendant. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And then we were looking around for somebody to prepare the case on Hans Fritzsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He...he was head of the Radio Division of Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry, and who broadcasts once a week under the title of "Hans Fritsche Spricht", "Hans Fritzsche Speaks.” </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And this was broadcast to the German people every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And he engaged in a tremendous amount of inflammatory propaganda against the Bolshevistic Jewish Imperialistic Capitalistic Interveners in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's private affairs and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we didn't have...we couldn't find his the originals of his speeches, or the copies of his speeches. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">All we had were the translations which the British Broadcasting Company had made and then they'd destroyed the tapes, unfortunately, because the they needed the records for further interceptions that they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They were short of records apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So what we had to do is translate from the English back to the German these materials and present them to Fritzsche in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And actually he took very little exception to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">In a couple of cases, he changed a word or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But his lawyer, Dr. Fritz strange because he was represented Fritzche. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Dr. Fritz and I got to be fairly collegial in our relationships, and I submitted a proposed outline of...in which Fritzche would indicate all of his connections to the Nazi party that he was willing to talk about, which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And it was...we figured that this was as good a way as to get out as the last man in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> as any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So he submitted this and it enabled me to write a fairly decent brief on him and also the people working on propaganda generally were appreciative of these materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And about that time Colonel Storey said to me, "I think we owe you something other than trying Fritzsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">How would you like to work on the case against Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler Youth Leader, and later Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I said, Fine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So that was my second assignment, was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Both of those...the preparation of both of those cases led to my being able to present the case against those two defendants to the <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">One in January and one in February of 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Before we go into the actual trial, can you tell us what Fritzsche was like as a person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Well, Fritzsche attempted to play the role of the student I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He'd been a radio commentator under the Weimar Republic for a conservative bunch of publications and who also owned some radio stations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And Goebbels had liked his work and as soon as the Nazi's came to power, Goebbels called him in for an interview and told him that he wanted to give him a high position in the Propaganda Ministry. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So he was made the head of the division dealing with the press, the German Press Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And although he got his instructions from Goebbels and from Otto Dietrich whom we later tried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and did convict...Fritzsche repeated this garbage that he was given before the preparation of each of the wars, although he was never a party to any of the planning. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But he would repeat what he was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I thought this would be ample to indict him...to convict him on Count One, on the conspiracy count. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He wasn't convicted on that Count at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But in the process of this, we got a lot of materials that were quite useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And you were asking what kind of fellow Fritzsche was, he was a very good speaker...had a very good voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he was well liked by a lot of ordinary Germans because of his manner on the...on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He was rather disliked by some of the party people because he hadn't become a party member until after Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And a number of them had ambitions to the mainly radio people, and, of course, Fritzsche stole the show on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Tell us about the opening of the trials, would you please? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Could you give us some sense of the <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> was like and who was present? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Just the general atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  The <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> was on the east side of the huge <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Justice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And it was actually the place where the Germans had held proceedings. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The rest of the <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Justice</span> had contained prosecutors, administrators of the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Franconia</span> and was mainly the <span class="BUILDING">administrative headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But this separate <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which is connected by a small <span class="DLF">passageway</span> was the place where the Trials were going to be held. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">An architect whose name I forget now, who worked for OSS, was pushed in very early and he immediately came up with the design and it required knocking out some <span class="DLF">walls</span> and to make the <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> larger so there'd be room for the press and for visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And he did a terrific job on this, and also made <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> for the photographic apparatus that would be used and for the sound equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Every bit of the Trial was recorded on tape, so that there could never be any argument about what was said and also it helped the interpreters when they went back to check whether ...whether they'd interpreted quite accurately or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It helped them a great deal to have this recording. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> ...as you entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> through the main <span class="DLF">door</span> , immediately to the left was the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , which is made up of two rows of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> where the defendants sat. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And at the back of the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> that went down four’ floors to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> which then led over to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by a <span class="DLF">passageway</span> that had been built, and covered with with an awning so that they wouldn't get wet in case it was raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Immediately beside the...the <span class="DLF">prisoners' dock</span> was the interpreting section which had about eight interpreters in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And that was walled in by glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And behind it there was this simultaneous interpretation equipment whereby if a person were speaking in German...that would be on Channel |. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Channel...we had a simultaneous interpreting system which 1s...I should go into perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But <span class="BUILDING">Channel 1</span> was always a voice being spoken either in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And the interpreters would get this voice and translate it into the other three languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">If English were being spoken, it would be translated into German, French and Russian, and if Russian were being spoken, it would be translated into the other three languages, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And these were very key people, and they were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">A man by the name of Colonel Doscert, D-O-S-C-E-R-T had recruited the initial interpreters and helped train them in using this simultaneous translation equipment, which was very new. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It had never been used before except for the <span class="BUILDING">International Labor Office</span> ...I think, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> had tested it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But when the...when IBM heard that there was going to a four-power trial, they sent someone in to see my friend, Charlie Horsky, from the firm of Covington and Burling, who was helping Justice Jackson at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And actually Jackson was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> when Charlie Horsky informed him about this system, and Jackson immediately became ’Correction of Interviewee: Three floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">utterly impressed by it because during the...the negotiations for the London agreement, which was signed on August 8, 1945, they'd had to have interpreters in there translating from the American to the French to the Russian and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And it had been...slowed down the process very much, whereas if you had simultaneous translation, you could speed up the process by at least one half, by at least one-half. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Well, to get back to the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , after you got past the interpreters, went around, you came to the <span class="DLF">witness box</span> on the, also on the east side of the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Then on the south side of the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , there was a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> which had been built and behind that sat the eight judges, the four principal judges and their four...four alternates. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Incidentally, in the construction of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , this architect first had the idea of sitting the alternate judges down just a little bit lower than the principal judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And when Judge Parker’”, the alternate American judge, saw that, he immediately screamed and, of course, Judge Biddle'', the American judge took it up with the American authorities, and they immediately corrected that particular error. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The...in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">judges bench</span> were the official court stenographers and the persons representing...you might say the court officers representing each of the Tribunals. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">There was an American, a Britisher, Englishman, and the French, who would take any instructions the judges had or do any errands that the judges had and who would fetch witnesses and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Then coming around a little bit further was the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> of the prosecution which faced toward the east and the judges were on the right and the defendants were on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The distance between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and the first judges maybe 12 feet between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and Goering 1n the corner was about 12, 13 feet, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Behind the prosecutor were five...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">prosecution podium</span> , were five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , each of which sat about 10 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Four of them were assigned to the...the prosecution, one to each of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">delegations</span> and one to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> so they could have their deputies sit there if they wished. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Then behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">prosecution tables</span> was a... one row for people on the staff and and behind that was the press, a little rostrum and no one was supposed to from the press, was supposed to come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> that. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And then up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> ...they'd built a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> on this thing with oh, about 12 or 13 rows for VIPs, Very Important Persons, or for visitors or for those who didn't have passes to the main section, if they couldn't get in, they could watch the trial from up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  What kind of pressures were on you as you began your prosecution of this trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  The principal pressures that were on us were the pressures created by language, too few translators and an awful lot of prosecutors and judges who didn't understand the German language at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So this slowed us down a great deal, and the fact that I knew a little German...I'd had 3 and a half years at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> , and I'd traveled over there a little bit...helped me a great deal and so I was able to help other attorneys and make suggestions to them as to how they can move a long a little bit faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was hardly any of the trial counsel who later appeared in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , for the Americans, who spoke German, Fudge John Parker. (</span><span class="sentence" id="222">Information supplied by interviewee.) </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Judge Francis J. Biddle. (</span><span class="sentence" id="224">Information supplied by interviewee.) </span><span class="sentence" id="225">which is most unfortunate because if there had been more of us that did, we would have moved a lot faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Tell us about the Trials if you would please. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">You were prosecuting Fritzsche?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Well, the first defendant I prosecuted was Baldur von Schirach, actually, although I'd begun to make preparations on the Fritzsche case first. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But since Fritzsche was the last man on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , he was also the last person about whom we made a presentation to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Baldur von Schirach was in the second row of the <span class="DLF">dock</span> , but about the third man in. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And so, a case against him was made a couple of weeks before the case on Fritzsche was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And we were told, as we prepared our briefs, we were told to try to shorten them up a bit so we wouldn't take too much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And most of us managed to get our presentations in 1n 2 hours against the individual defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Now before that, a tremendous amount of material had been put in about the development of the Nazi regime, about each of the invasions, about the War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanities practiced against had applications to civilians in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as well as outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> , the slave labor, the Jews, the Gypsies, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Actually, there was no presentation on Gypsies separately, which I think was a great mistake, and I have developed a chapter on that for my book which I'll bring you next time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Can you tell us...actually before we go into the von Schirach prosecution, something of the controversy as you were involved in it or if you were involved in... particularly on the Crimes against Humanity charge and the whole question of the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Well, the...the Count One, the conspiracy to wage aggressive war, was alleged in very broad terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Uh...Justice Jackson had this notion that the conspiracy reached way back even to the times of the Munich Putsch when Hitler formed the party program and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Now, of course, a lot of the defendants didn't become attached anything having to do with Hitler until sometime later. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And we had the idea that under the Master Race doctrine, the Nazis had seized power, they had consolidated power. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They had persecuted first Germans and then they'd persecuted Jews within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And then, of course, they'd marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> where they really stepped up the persecution of minority people and particularly the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And then after the war began, the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the press was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you might say, and there was a real iron curtain established. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">That is when Hitler really began to let loose with his doctrines of evacuating and eventually exterminating the Jewish people, Gypsies, even talked about Poles and Slavs as being of an inferior race that ought be cut down and their numbers used as slaves to the master race. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">After the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in September 1939, Hitler held a conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> which was attended by a quite a number of people, including the head of the Abwehr, the counterintelligence who was actually never very much for Hitler, and later on turned against him, and was executed after the attempt on Hitler's life in '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But he came out of that first meeting that Hitler had after the conquest of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and told a witness that we had about how Hitler had said that when we go into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we don't come in order to establish a very efficient government and to please the Polish people and the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We came to put them in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And he spoke of...at that point, of exterminating Jews and evacuating them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And actually, of course, the tremendous number of Poles and Jews were exterminated just after that campaign. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But the...the main exterminations, of course, didn't take place until the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when you had the so-called Eintsatzgruppen of Himmler. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The SS sent in four different uh..battle groups to follow behind the invading Germans and to liquidate all the people they considered enemies, and these, of course, were particularly Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And altogether, my guess would be that a million people were executed well before the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, which a lot of people take as being the kind of the beginning of the Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">In my opinion, that's entirely wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">That Wannsee Conference actually brought in more departments, the economics department and a lot of others that hadn't been directly involved in any great extent and...and indicated to them that this Solution was going on and that they were expected to be a part of it, and that this meant there was a lot of assets that could be absorbed, etcetera., </span><span class="sentence" id="255">etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  How was this case developed during the trial? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">How did the lawyers for the prosecution develop the case against the case to prove that there had been a deliberate plot to exterminate the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, there was a whole group...I think it was first under a Major Walsh'*, which worked on this subject in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and long before actually, OSS people had worked on developing papers on what was happening to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But Major Walsh had this team. (</span><span class="sentence" id="260">Clearing Throat) And when they came...when we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , we found that the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of the...Julius Streicher, the main Jew-baiter of all time, were reasonably well intact and that and we captured a full set of the Sttirmer, the Stormer, which was his official publication. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Now some copies of that, of course, had been available before hand outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had been kept and in some cases they hadn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But this now offered a tremendous well of additional information. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And the case against Streicher was relatively weak because we couldn't prove that he knew about the extermination of the Jews until some information came in the war through the Stiirmer, that he was talking about the Israelitische Wochenblatt, a weekly published by Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And in there, the editors of this newspaper had said some history about the extermination of the Jews, and Streicher in the Sturmer published some of this and underneath, it said, "This is no Goddamn Jewish lie.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And so that is what when we found that out, we had some additional materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And that was not used until his cross examination by the British, and it was used very effectively. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And got him into a real bind and made him obviously appear to be...having lied all the way through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Tell us more about the cases in which you were directly involved during this first trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  When I was assigned to work on the case of Baldur von Schirach, the Youth... Youth Leader, another attorney and some other and some of his people helping him, Major Hartley Murray had developed considerable amount of materials on the Hitler Youth and on Baldur von Maj or William F. Walsh, Assistant Trial Counsel, U.S.A. Information supplied by interviewee. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Schirach. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And really Major Hartley Murray should have been assigned that case, but I think they somehow wanted to throw me an easier case than the Schirach’” case and so I was assigned to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Baldur von Schirach had formed a Nazi group or the youth group about 1925 or so when he was himself in...1n <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And Hitler heard about it and asked him to come for an interview, and Hitler made him the Hitler Youth Leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Also Hitler's main photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, had a daughter by the name of Henrietta, and Hitler introduced Schirach to Henrietta Hoffmann and they began...they were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So that was another thing which brought Hitler...Schirach into fairly close proximity to...to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He developed the Hitler Youth before Hitler came to power to a very substantial group. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they got songwriters to write some marching songs for them and it became a group which was put into the parades that the Nazis put on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> every November to celebrate the Nazi Putsch of 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And Schirach was more and more brought to the fore in connection with these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">As soon as Hitler...as the Nazis came to power, Hitler appointed Schirach to be the National Youth Leader and he was given such power that he was able to destroy the youth organizations of the opposition which were fairly strong actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And finally, he even took over the Catholic youth organizations and forced them into the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">After more indoctrination of various kinds and so on, he made agreements with Hitler...or with Himmler, the head of the SS, that some of the Youth members, Hitler Youth members who had shown great promise would be put directly into the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And also he made an arrangement with the head of the Armed Forces that Hitler youth would get some preferences about indoctrination into the Armed Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So he was well involved in connection with having polluted the mind of young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">When the war came along, he continued in this work until Hitler called him down to (clearing throat) Berchtesgaden one time and told him that he wanted him to become the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ...that he wasn't...hadn't been satisfied with the earlier leadership in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and he had alienated an awful lot of Austrians and wouldn't he accept that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Of course, a request from Hitler is like a demand and Von Schirach went and became the Gauleiter and the rank governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Actually, by the time... uh...Schirach got that position, most of the Jews had already been pushed out of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and there probably weren't...1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which had a half a million Jews, there probably weren't more than a couple of hundred thousand left at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But Schirach had the idea of having a Youth conference of the youth...of leaders of youth from various <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> in September of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And while addressing them, he said, "If I have sent thousands upon thousands of Jews into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> of the east, then I consider it a contribution to European civilization.” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Now that speech was published the next day in the Voelkische Beobachter, which is the official Nazi paper in in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , as well as in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And, of course that was used very early in the briefs that Hartley Murray and others had prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And it is what I use as my perovation, my last words, in making the case against von Schirach. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I said, "And in closing, your Honors,"...and then I just repeated those words that he had stated. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I was very surprised that he didn't get a sentence of more than 20 years because he had done a lot of things, but I think one of the reasons was his behavior in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> during the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He became very open and he made releases to the press, and ‘Correction of Interviewee: Fritzsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">he indicated that Hitler had betrayed the German people and he'd betrayed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And that he wanted to make amends, as far as he could, although he realized that was not possible and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I think this influenced the Tribunal to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I don't know, but I think it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Otherwise, I think they would have sentenced him to death, which is what I had expected he would get.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Mr. Sprecher, could you talk somewhat, please, about how a case was developed and what it was like to have to bring a case then to trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the case was largely developed...uh...on a subject by subject basis to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And it was only later that it was broken down to be directed against individual defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So for example, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , in July and August, a large number of German documents had been found. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">British Foreign Office documents and the Rosenberg files that I mentioned before and a group that was working on...for instance, the (clearing throat) occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in March of 1938, they would have gone back into these files and dug up documents that had to do with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They would have gotten keys to newspaper articles about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The Austrian case, of course, was rather out in the open because that was a case of marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But on the other hand, what happened at the conference where Schuschnigg, the Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , was brought into the Berchtesgaden and a lot of pressure applied to him, that we wouldn't have known about until we got a summary that had been made by someone who was present, a German assistant to Hitler, one of his adjutants or someone else who made a summary of the conference, and how the pressure was put on or... Now we did have interrogations made during this preliminary period of all, not only of the prospective defendants, but other people about how things had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I observed a lot of those interrogations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But we never...we seldom used that interrogation material in the actual trial because we had better materials by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now in a few cases, they did in order to confront witnesses on cross examinations. "</span><span class="sentence" id="314">Now during your preliminary interrogations you did or you didn't admit this. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Why didn't you admit it? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Or didn't you say something different? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh...That gave us quite an advantage which you often don't have where the defendant, prospective defendant can claim the right against self- incrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Now, we were charged into the Charter’*...the prosecution of this charter, with the obligation of interrogating possible defendants before they were interrogated...before they were indicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So there's...there's a little different approach there than there would be an Anglo-Saxon law. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh...So there's a whole group that was working on the various aggressive war charges, the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And with their research analysts these lawyers would scan documents and the research analysts would write what was called the Staff Evidence Analysis, an SEA. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And at the top of that it would give the name of the document or what the document was about, what defendants were mentioned in the document what other leading Germans were mentioned in the document...before it even went into what was shown by the document. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And then there would be a brief analysis in there as to what the document showed. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Now at this point the document had not been translated so that anybody in English could read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">These were German-speaking research analysts, most of them refugees from the Nazi regime who were given briefings as to what we were looking for, and then they would go into the documents and they would write these SEAs and they would come to mostly English speaking lawyers and English speaking “The Charter of the <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Information supplied by interviewee. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">lawyers say, "That's good. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That doesn't belong’ to anything," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And then they would...we would either have a good document translated or we would say, "Look, see if you can find some other documents around that document that bear on the same subject which are even more telling in their...of...1n the proof they give.” </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So we had these various kind of subteams of the prosecution team who worked on these things, and actually the British and the Americans mixed some of the teams so we had on some of the teams Peter Calvocoressi who is a British commander, wrote a book'° on the Nuremberg trials later. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He was...he worked with Telford Taylor in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in counterintelligence during the end of the war, and he came right over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> when Taylor came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So we had some...some very close collaboration there. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The staff tended to divide between those who were working on aggressive war, those who were working on the maltreatment of people in the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> , including...and then we had a separate group working on the persecution of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But they worked very close together with the group working on the total mistreatment of civilians and minorities in the...well, majorities in the case of the Soviet Union’ in the...the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Now the Germans were tremendous document keepers and very few documents were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Orders were made to destroy the documents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> themselves, but in some cases this wasn't even done, or in some cases the Russians advanced so quickly that they...they still found lists of people who had been exterminated or some of the documents about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> after they'd occupied it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And there is a death book, I think from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , which used to be...which was...I've seen it not only over there, but I saw it in the archives and I think it's now been taken out to __'*. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">You might want to see it sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> you have a listing of people who were killed each day, and this was partly kept by a Kapo, a Kapo, a...one of the prisoners, one of the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And using a certain amount of imagination, he listed the name and the number of the inmate and under cause of death he put each case "Herzschlag"-- heart...heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So here you have...and then what he did was enter | every minute throughout the day or if that... more people had been killed than that, he'd enter a number at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But he did everything kind of alphabetically and to the extent he could and in these groups of these time groupings, so that anybody who got this book could tell that something was going on besides people just dying of natural causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And that book you might be interested in getting hold of. . .”” </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So tell us more now about...you're building a case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Well, all these Staff Evidence Analysis were passed to all the lawyers and we all read them and so we had a general idea what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Then a very important person at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , Commander Whitney Harris, who wrote the Tyranny on Trial, is a good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He and I decided that we ought to organize some briefings at night of all the prosecutors just generally about what was the nature of the Nazi regime and what was developing in these various study groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And so we held... up until the time that indictments were going to be issued, we must have held about 18 of this nightly meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">We didn't hold them every night, but maybe two a week, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And for instance, I presented an organized presentation on the "Fuehrerprinzip", the leadership principal. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">How in the Nazi party, theoretically, you had the leader at the top and the passing down of the orders and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Now actually it turned out that things didn't work quite the way the Nazi organization book specified but at least that was the theory then, and that was exchanged at these meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So that helped us keep abreast of each other, and I think Whitney Harris and I are both very proud of having done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Jackson came and spoke to one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Now Storey held weekly staff conferences. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And at those staff conferences, the people in the Documentation Division would report on various things. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And as they began to develop rough preliminary trial briefs, these would be available if you wanted to see them, but normally speaking they weren't exchanged...that it was felt that this 1s getting out material that wasn't particularly thoroughly checked yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It might get into the wrong hands, the press and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But I could go and find out what was the status of the brief in another <span class="NPIP">section</span> or they could come and say, "What's the status of the brief on destruction of the trade unions and the creation of the German Labor Front," and I would show them everything I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So these briefs were created in advance of the trial, and from them Jackson while even while they were in preliminary shape, Jackson began to draft the indictment. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And so David Maxwell-Fyfe~’, later Lord Kilmuir, the Lord...the Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> came over to see what Jackson was doing because between the time of the London Agreement on August 8th and the issuance of the indictment on about October 17th, or something like that, of 1945, there was a great deal of work had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And the...the French and the Russians didn't come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> until, oh, sometime in late August or September. (</span><span class="sentence" id="375">Clearing Throat) Well, and...and certainly not even until September or early October. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And Jackson didn't know very much about the two...about one of the defendants the Russians wanted to have indicted and who was indicted, Fritzsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Or even about Raeder, who was the Grand Admiral of the Navy, but who'd kind of fallen out with Hitler in 1943, and kind of become inactive. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So these became things that had to be quickly developed into some kind of a form "Mr. David Maxwell-Fyfe, Deputy Chief Prosecutor, <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">so that Jackson could help draft his brief and so we could have materials to put in the brief on these other subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Now the Russians insisted on putting in a lot of materials about what happened in...in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , including the Katyn business within... The French brought in a lot of things, including that 7 and a half francs were stolen by someone on the <span class="DLF">street corner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a tremendous detail that the French brought in about what had been purloined and spoliated in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And they insisted on some of this being put into the indictment, which made the indictment overly long. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">In my view, it was overly long even from what we put into it, but you put in additional amounts of the French and the Russians...and the Soviets insisted on putting in, and you got too long an indictment. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Uh...The Americans...(clearing throat)....1t was just understood that since Jackson had pushed for the trials and had been the main leader in negotiating the London Agreement, that the Americans would take the conspiracy count, Count One, and present most of the materials on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">After we presented a fair amount of materials on that, it became so clear that the British had a lot to do because they were working on Count Two, which was the waging of aggressive war, that we better combine some of these so actually we had some presentations during that aggressive war part by British counsel in addition to American counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And the British and the Americans got on extremely well together in the trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I think we had...there was a mutual admiration at the top as well as down in the ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Uh...a lot of mutual respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The British had only Sir David Maxwell...Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, and about six barristers. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But they were superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They were terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And they...on cross examination, for example, did better jobs on the whole than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Now Jackson was not a good cross examiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Uh...That was not his fort. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He was a great advocate. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He knew how to express things in the English language with a flavor and a...uh..stirring vocabulary which no one else had. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Sir Hartley Shawcross, who was the main chief British prosecutor in the...1n a tribute to Jackson, after Jackson died in 1954, said that there was no...no one among the British staff that equaled him in terms of his capacity to use the English language, which is rather interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  You've started telling us about some of the...the defense team. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Would you tell us more about the people involved some more about Jackson and Storey and some of the others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Justice Jackson had gotten to know a man by the name of Sidney Alderman very well because of Alderman's presentations before the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He was the General Counsel of the Southern Railroad, and he asked Alderman to become one of his top deputies and to assist him. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Uh...I first met Alderman when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Uh...Alderman was a...had an incredible capability to read an awful lot of materials that were submitted to him to digest them and to make a coherent, relatively succinct statement out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Jackson relied on him a great deal in terms of aggressive war counts, to go over the materials that had been found, to stimulate the attorneys to find more materials, and then to make the final briefs and then for Alderman to make almost all those presentations with several exceptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And several of those exceptions were British who were brought in and made presentations on aggressive war. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And I'm not sure who the American would be that made some as well, but I think there was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Colonel Storey had done work during the war that had come to the attention of Justice Jackson, and he'd been a...gone abroad for OSS on a thing or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And Jackson thought he'd be a good man to head up the Documentation Division, and brought him in and shipped him directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And...the amount of materials that few of us...few research analysts and a few others found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was so much greater in terms of volume and relevance to what was being found by the Joint British- American team in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> based on the documents they had, that Jackson began to insist on bringing more people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And a lot of them didn't like...or into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and most...lot of them didn't like to come because London life was very nice and they didn't think Paris life was so great. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But he did finally bring a group into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and within 2 or 3 weeks, got them to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And Colonel Storey was then made Executive Trial Counsel, and after the indictment was in the last stages, he was through his deputies and associates, was probably contributing more toward what went into the indictment than any single person so it became logical for Jackson to appoint him Executive Trial Counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And what Storey did was first prepare a basis for informing the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as to how we'd captured these documents, to how we'd process them, and so on so we didn't have to prove in each case the document source and it would have delayed the trial tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So a major by the man of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coogan</span> , Major Coogan, had been appointed the person to go and search out files in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Actually, he didn't speak German, so he had some assistants who actually helped him a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And he brought....he with the man who helped find the...or bring back the Rosenberg files, and a number of other files to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then take them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Then he left the staff, and he never presented the case or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Major Baldwin, later Colonel Baldwin, became (clearing throat) Storey's assistant and he and I became quite close and he asked me to or we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> together to open the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> you might say...1f I would like to share a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with him, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And when it came to presenting cases I'm sure he put in a good word for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And he'd presented the case against Hans Frank, the Governor-General of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and before our presentations why we'd critique each other back in our little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we stayed so as to try to perfect our presentations. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Baldwin was extremely valuable to Storey because he took a awful lot of administrative detail, and this gave Storey legs you might say to work more on getting materials in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jackson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Another very important person was Colonel Leonard Wheeler, Jr. of whom you have a little letter in there that he wrote about to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He became...he's the head of the Documentation Division in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And when they...he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then on into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , he was made Storey's deputy. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And either Jackson or else Storey made the decision that they should sit together almost back to back in the head...1n this central large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of the Documentation Division so as to prove that these two staffs had merged on the one hand and on the other hand to show that there was complete trust about exchanging materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And they worked very well together. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Storey decided to present to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> some of the cases against the criminal organizations, and Wheeler presented the case against suppression of the Christian churches. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Then both of them left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in January of 1946, along with a lot of other people who were there and left behind only about four or five of us who had developed materials and cases and so on to assist Jackson and tie him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">That's kind of how the staff developed and how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There was a tremendous number of lawyers who were a little unhappy about how things went and if obviously they didn't...perhaps didn't get as big a title as they wanted or something like that, an awful lot of them wanted to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They'd been overseas or one thing or another, and some of them that I'm sure could have done very good work had they stayed on left as soon as they'd made their presentations and a lot of them who weren't assigned to make a presentation before the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> immediately left, so that left the rest of us with more research analysts than we'd had before and a smaller staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  What was the atmosphere like in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> while these trials were going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Well, that varied a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">When we first came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> which hadn't been shelled and so on, life wasn't too bad except that an awful lot of people from the main part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , which had been bombed, were moved out to these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And so <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were filled up in many cases two and three times what they normally had been before, so there was an awful lot of crowding in this sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The downtown part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , had been bombed to a fare-thee-well. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">There were very few <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">There were one or two where part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was standing and I recall having gone into those...uh..a time or time either to get witnesses or because somebody local was holding a party and...uh...knew that if we were invited we'd be able to bring some whiskey or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">During the first days, you could hardly walk during parts...into parts of the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The fact is you couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">The court photographer by the name of Ray D'Assasrio, has developed a book called Nuernberg:Damals/Heute: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , Then and Now. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And this has gone through a number of editions 1n...uh...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He took a tremendous number of pictures of various important <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> then and now. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">After they're rebuilt, he took it and he has these on opposite pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And he's made a small fortune out of this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Incidently, I have a copy of it if you...1f you don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But you should get a copy of that book because it shows the circumstances in which the trial, you might say, in which the trial grew. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was standing in most cases, but in some cases some of the turrets had been blown of on it, and some of...much of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was pockmarked by explosions, either from bombs or from shells. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And there were...some cases you...even when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> 20, 25 years after the trial, you could see how...where these parts of the old <span class="DLF">city wall</span> had been bricked up and fenced over because they had a different sheen than what the...the old <span class="DLF">wall</span> had. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Uh...The <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> when we first came there, which became the center for most of the visitors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> passing through. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We were there for the first week of our stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And the front part of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to the right of the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> was still...a bomb had fallen and just blown it to smithereens. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And by the time we got there they had scaffolding up and were beginning to repair it. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And when we went up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> we had to walk on little planks holding onto guide rails as we crossed part of this <span class="DLF">chasm</span> that had been created by this bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Uh...The amount of effort which was put into restoring that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> , and some of the other...the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I mean whole battalions of engineers were sent in. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Materials were flown from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Of course, we lacked glass, and there was very little glass made in German, so we took over the <span class="BUILDING">Belgium glass market</span> for a few months in order to put <span class="DLF">windows</span> throughout the <span class="BUILDING">court house</span> as well as into the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were bombed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  What kind of reception did you get from the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Well, mostly the...the Germans were so shell shocked from the process of the bombings and all... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had been bombed incredibly and a tremendous number of people had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I don't know, I think next to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had gotten a big a hit as almost any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Well, that's not quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There was some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span> that had got it as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But people were on very poor rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">You could see it 1n their faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You could buy anything for a few packs of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">There was quite a traffic 1n...whatever people had been able to save from their <span class="NPIP">bombed out places</span> , they'd trade it off with farmers, peasants around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in order to get enough to get enough to barely pass eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Actually, the Americans sent in rations and the Germans were...the rations were fortified by the Americans for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">One reason we were able to attract so many of the people around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> who spoke both languages to help us in the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> was that they immediately got a different ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And one reason the defense counsel were delighted after they were put on a list, the defense counsel on which the defendants could choose. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">One of the things they were very happy about is that they got a very good ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Now their ration wasn't up to ours, but they did get an inferior brand of cigarettes and they got a mild amount of whiskey I think, probably an off-brand, but they also got a basic...food rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And who...with whomever they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> they would share this, of course, and then at lunch, we built a defense counsel mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And they would stack up on food in the defense counsel mess, but for breakfast and for dinners they ate in their own...in the lodgings they'd found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">A couple of the defense counsels came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , including Streicher's counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  You told me before that you worked on different aspects of this, including the early German opposition to Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Would you tell us about that, and about how you dealt with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Well, I had known from my work with OSS and from contacts I made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and elsewhere that there were Germans who'd been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and who had survived who would make supposedly pretty good witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So, for instance, one witness by the name of Matthias Lex, L-E-X, was the head of the Shoemakers' Union of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ”! </span><span class="sentence" id="483">steadily from 1933 until 1938, 5 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">In the process, he had seen happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> tremendous number of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , he'd seen the opposition come in, and he'd made an affidavit for me in which he'd listed by name, 40 people including a bishop whose name I forget right now, but he listed various top leaders who'd been confined in roughly the periods that he'd recalled that they'd been confined in...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And then he included...then he told about how, after a certain period of time, Jews were begun to be brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> after Goering had begun his nefarious work in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And likewise he mentioned that the Bibelforscher, the “Correction of Interviewee: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration Camp Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Bible Students, that there were 150 of them which had been brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and about 150 Gypsies that were there at a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So all of this I put into this affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And this led to other people following up on those leads to get a lot...a lot of further materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I don't mean to say that this is the only thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">It was one of the things that helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And there had been some indications that what we should do is put on some of the former leaders of the Weimar Republic as to tell what had happened to them and that we should put on some of the leaders of the Jewish organizations outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to talk about what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">This was pretty much voted down on the theory that we had better evidence on the one hand, and number two, that these people would be long winded, if not garrulous, and that it would prolong the trial a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So what we did was use the information we got from these people and those cases in which it was useful to help us with leads and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And on the whole the trial was based on contemporaneous German documents or upon (clearing throat) witnesses who had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or who'd been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Now in the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we got the commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> who was not captured until about April of 1946, and he wasn't there during the early part, but we got him, and the British sent him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , and the American's interrogated him. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And he just laid it out in black and white as to how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span> was made, how it was organized, and how many people were exterminated there, and the whole story on the Gypsies... which and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">His name was Rudolph Hoess, H-O-E-S-S, and after he was shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where he was tried, convicted, sentenced and before he was executed, he wrote a book called "Commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And that book has tn it...some of the materials on the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Actually, I was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He didn't give the material on the Gypsies while he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> because he was not asked unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But when he was...in this book he wrote the full story on what happened to the Gypsies and on these materials, people like Martin Gilbert and others later found a lot more materials, and that whole case on the Gypsies had developed a lot more than it ever was developed at the Nuremberg trials, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  Did you have any contact with Hoess at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  With whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Did you have any contact with Hoess at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I mean I saw him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , but I didn't talk to him nor did I interrogate him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  You talked to other victims?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  I talked to people who did talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And suggested some questions, but I didn't...I was not in the Interrogation Division, and by the time he came the... Actually, he was called as a defense witness by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the top SS man on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But we'd interrogated him as well during the cross examination of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We just put in this affidavit and asked him if he would like to correct any part of it, and he said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And then a few of the highlights were brought out for the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">There was some incredible German witnesses as you may know from reading the judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">One was a man by the name of Graebe, G-R-A-E-B-E, who had been the leader of a <span class="BUILDING">German factory</span> that was established in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I forget the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But he talked about how he was required to release Jews who were working in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and that he heard about how they were being exterminated and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So one day he just went out to where he heard they were being shot and put into <span class="DLF">trenches</span> actually and buried in <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And he went out there and before the SS prevented him, he was able to watch a whole sequence of this go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So he became a witness and testified at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and quite a bit of his testtmony is reproduced in the actual judgment of the Tribunal, as indicating how these Einsatzgruppen worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And of course, we had tremendously impressive evidence on that subject from Otto Ohlendorf, who was the head of one of the four Einsatzgruppen himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But Ohlendorf was not as the big boss at the top of that group in the same position to talk about what had happened in a specific extermination of a particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , that Graebe was able to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So you see we have this combination of materials, contemporaneous documents, a few German witnesses on whom we had materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And in the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohlendorf</span> , he knew that he eventually was going to be tried and that he'd get the rope, he talked quite freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And then we had people like Graebe who talked quite freely or talked very freely without any reservation. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And if I'm not mistaken Graebe and if not, someone like him, found it very uncomfortable living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> just after the war and went to...to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and that a <span class="DLF">street</span> is named for him and a statue has been erected for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Now if it isn't I can check up on who that is, but it's one of...someone like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  What other witnesses come to mind that strike you by their testimony?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  The witness I'm trying to think about, whose name escapes me unfortunately, was our our first witness and he was the deputy to head of the Abwehr’, and he'd been on the list to be extermin...to be executed by Hitler's hangman after the attempt on Hitler's life. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">He was our first witness and was able to give tremendously impressive testimony. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But it took so much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It took, you know, nearly a day by the time the defense was done cross examining him. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Now actually he was not cross examined by the defense as much, to show that things were wrong that he said, as he was questioned in a couple of cases to try to bring out materials that helped particular defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">For instance, Schacht was able to...Schacht's attorney was able to use him to indicate that Schacht had nothing to do with this and that and the other thing, and that Schacht was also suspected...was known to be a part of the opposition, but he didn't dare show his face very much and therefore, he wasn't very obvious as some of the others were. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I'll bring a note on some of the leading witnesses at the next time if you like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  What else would you like to tell us about that first trial before we move on or the first set of the trials? “</span><span class="sentence" id="540">General Erwin Langlesen. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Information supplied by interviewee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Well, after we'd presented...developed the case on a subject basis, such as I've described, the different invasions, persecution of minorities, persecution of the Jews, spoilation, stealing of art treasures, Germanization, and so on, the next thing was ___ defendants' names has been mentioned in these documents, but it hasn't been pulled together. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">The <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> has a very small staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We'd better be sure that the...this is pulled together for the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> and for history. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe indicated to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> that the prosecution at a certain stage would like to make individual presentations, gathering together this evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">This had already been done in December before the Christmas holidays with respect to the slave labor case, with respect to Speer, defendant Speer, and the Defendant Sauckel. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I'm sure that this had impressed the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that that those two men were brought in in dramatic colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe said to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> , "We'd like to do a similar thing with respect to other individuals.” </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So some of us were assigned different things and Commander Albrecht from the Navy presented the case on Goering, and the British presented the case on von Ribbentrop and, so on it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I managed to get two out of the 22 presentations that...which I thought was pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  Tell us about those two presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  Well, I had partly discussed them in the case of Baldur Von Schirach, the Youth Leader, and the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> earlier, and of course, Hans Fritzsche who was the radio propagandist. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And I gave you a bit on that before too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  The first set of trials as they wound down, the Nuremberg Trials you began to prepare for subsequent trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  You said set of trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There was only one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">As the Trial wound down, you began...
ANSWER:  Actually, when the trial was...the prosecution was still putting on his case...people who had developed different materials were either going to leave or they were going to be used for something else, and so I made this recommendation to Jackson that we start to think about subsequent trials and he immediately made me Director of the Subsequent Proceedings Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And from that time on, which was already in the same month the Trial opened, November of 1945, from then on we...a small group of us started to prepare materials and watch for materials that people on the main case found which would lead toward possible trials later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And for instance, on experiments on human beings, medical experiments...Now there was early materials that had been found on that during the first trial, but they weren't terribly extensive, but they were sufficient enough so that they were made a part of the case in chief and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I suggested to Alexander Hardy that he might want...when he came over at about April of 1946 that he might want to get in on..1n on the medical cases that I thought he...it was the kind of thing that would interest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">He took it over and developed a tremendous case which led to the materials that are now reproduced in the green volumes, volumes | and 2, about all the various medical experiments, a lot of which weren't touched at all in the main trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The second case...second subsequent proceedings was against Milch, which I thought was a mistake because it used up a whole Tribunal of three judges for one man and...but he was involved in medical experiments because as the deputy of Goering for material Air Force procurement, he'd had under him this research and they thought maybe some of these experiments would have some...some use to the air forces...the high altitude experiments, cold water experiments, etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="565">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So Milch was tried on that count plus the use of slave labor because he was on the Central Planning Board, along with Speer and Sauckel, the head of the Plenipotentiary for Labor Recruitment. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And that those materials from the labor recruitment was plainly done at a time when there was obvious tremendous number of slave labors were being used, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates were being used, etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="568">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Now the details of a lot of those cases were not developed until the secondary trials, the next 12 trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little more about how these cases were developed? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The people you've brought in...you've mentioned some...to develop them, and what the atmosphere was, political pressures and otherwise, as you develop them...a very different atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Before the first trial was over, tensions were already developing between the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Telford Taylor, General Telford Taylor who succeeded Jackson, had hoped very much to arrange at least one more international trial with the four powers working together and the judges representing the four powers, four Allied powers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">This quickly disappeared as a possibility because of this tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And the Russians after the first trial left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They left a liaison person or two behind, but they absolutely cleared out, including taking some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that we supplied to them and all their files and all the rest of this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Which is...they were certainly entitled to take their files. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But they weren't very cooperative with respect to any later trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So we decided to go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Now actually the French were in such bad shape from the occupation by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that they could not afford to do very much and they tried an awful lot of collaborators and French people and the few Germans that they got their hands on, but an awful lot of French justice was, I'm afraid, hanging people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or shooting them right on hand without trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And later on, as things quieted down, and they wanted to hold trials they really were short handed. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">One of their people, a fellow by the name of Charles Gerthoffer, was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and was a liaison to the economics cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I helped him prepare the case against Roechling, which was one of the fourth largest enterprises in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it had been very active in using slave labors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurttemberg</span> and in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> , what later became the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So we did help the French in that respect with a trial or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The British became so involved in reconstituting things that they conducted very few trials except those involving British officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And the one involving von Manstein, which was a...who was a leading German marshall in the invasion of the Soviet Union as well as several other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and he was prosecuted, actually, by Major Elwyn Jones, who was on the British Delegation during the first trial, who later prosecuted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He was the only Labour Member of Parliament who was in the...permanently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after this trial and got into the labor government on two different occasions and became the Lord Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And his title is Lord Elwyn Jones. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He wouldn't take another name. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He was originally a Welshman. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Well, that's a digression, but that indicates a little something there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  In these trials you were dealing particularly with things such as medical experiments, crimes against Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals...those kinds of things to a level of detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Can you tell us about that and tell us about some other witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Well, I think I might just go down the list of the cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The first trial, first subsequent trial involved the medical experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And incidentally in that trial, one of the defendants was a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And the only woman” who was tried in the Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And she received a sentence for a term of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I forget what. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">The second trial was against Erhard Milch who is Goering's deputy and he was sentenced to a life in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">The third trial was the so-called Justice case and it was a case against people who'd been...the chief judges of peoples <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> or the prosecutors in peoples <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And the film which was later done with Spencer Tracy on the...Justice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> involved that trial and a very small part of that trial if you will recall and that trial was the main prosecutor in that underneath General Taylor was a former Republican Congressman by the name of Charles LaFollette. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">As far as I know the only former congressman that appeared in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">The fourth trial was a so- called...the fourth trial was, I think, the Einsatzgruppen case, which was tried by Benjamin Ferencz as the main prosecutor under Taylor, and he's written a book since called, Less than Slaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">After he'd presented this case against the main Einsatzgruppen leaders who had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and killed so many people, he became head of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And built up enough case so that the German Government, although not accepting the theory of collective responsibility which I also do not accept, they agreed that it 1s right that recompense be made to all survivors that could be found, number one, and that where the survivors couldn't be found, the equivalent amount of money for a person killed would be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which did help in the reconstitution or the getting <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on its feet to a greater extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Well, that was the, I think, the fourth case. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The fifth case was the first of three industrialist cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">The first one was against Friedrich Flick, and involved a relatively small number of defendants about eight or so, including the Papa Flick himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And they were tried on slave labor using large numbers of slave labors, using <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates, and going into <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> as <span class="BUILDING">Flick Enterprises</span> and...and profiting from using the property of occupied people against the laws of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They got relatively short sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I forget just what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The sixth case is I.G. Farben where, the case of 1.G. Farben industry, where I was chief of the trial team. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And we indicted a total of 23 leaders of the Farben concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Now by this time I should say the gentle notion was developing that the...lot of these industrialists and so on were very capable people and should be drawn into the industry that was being reconstituted in the <span class="REGION">western zone</span> as well as in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , <span class="REGION">French zone</span> , and so there's a tendency to encourage us to hurry up with the trials number one, and number two later on, there was a which I can cover at another time, there was “Correction of Interviewee: Mr. Sprecher states that there were in fact two women tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He 1s referring in this instance to Frau Herta Oberheuser. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">tremendous pressure about reducing the sentences of some of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They were convicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Now General Taylor would have none of this reducing sentences and he was backed up by General Clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So there was none of the reduction of sentences during the four years that I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Well, to go on from the I.G. Farben case....
