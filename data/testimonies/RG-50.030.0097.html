<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Ivo, would you tell us your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Ivo Herzer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Uh, I was born <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , on February 5, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">What is, tell us something about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> and what it was like to grow up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> is the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It is one of the six republics in today's <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Uh, it had a population, Jewish population of 10,000 out of 200,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh, and uh, it was uh, it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that resembles <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to some extent in its atmosphere because it was in the Austro- Hungarian part for so many centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Tell me about, what was it like for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">How, where did your family live, in what <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  There was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  There was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There had never been any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The Jews lived, uh, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh, we lived downtown in my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My parents were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> already, but not my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> were strongly Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And as far as the religious preference, they were...they practiced conservative Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We were Ashkenazi, as opposed to the Sephardic Jews of <span class="REGION">eastern Yugoslavia</span> --in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> , in Bosnia[- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hercegovina</span> ], in <span class="COUNTRY">Montenegro</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The total Jewish community of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> before the war was about 70,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">As I said, with very strong ties to Eretz Israel at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  What about your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Who made up your, your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  I have no brothers or sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And uh, I never met my, uh, grandparents, except one grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So it was just my parents and I. My father was, uh, an employee in an <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We were middle-class, comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There were no signs of overt antisemitism there. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There was antisemitism but 1t was kept more or less under the surface; and especially in the main part of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> --in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> --there was no anti-semitism, because the Jews embraced the idea of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> rather than separate nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And so there was no government-sponsored antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">However, a Jew could not become a professor in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , or get a government position or a high government position. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">This was understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Unless you're baptized himself or herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But otherwise, we were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It was quite a comfortable life for the middle-class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  What kind of a schooling did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We had in those days four years of elementary education which was sectarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> and then it was followed by eight years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , of <span class="BUILDING">European high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I only finished six, because the war came. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or sixth grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  What was that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">This was a <span class="BUILDING">secular high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  This was a <span class="BUILDING">secular high school</span> , which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields of science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">There was Latin, French and German were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Religion was taught in separate classes to the Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So religion was actually the main subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was typical European, the educational system. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Did you enjoy it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Yes, I...] enjoyed it; because I... was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Most of the population did not participate in this type of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Uh, there was a high rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> of those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  You talked about there not being official antisemitism but that antisemitism was sort of felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Did you encounter any such incidents when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher who would meet us Jewish children going to our <span class="BUILDING">religion class</span> , to another <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He would say something. "</span><span class="sentence" id="65">Here come the chosen people." </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was sort of sarcastic, but 1t was...1t was that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Or, uh, if, uh, in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> sometimes children would shout, "Jew, go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh, incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There was a political party, underground, a fascist party which was antisemitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And they did write graffiti and publish slogans, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists, who didn't want <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They wanted independent Croatia, <span class="REGION">Catholic Croatia</span> ; and they were fiercely antisemitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But they lived mostly in exile. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In the inter-war years, they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> --which <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it happened, they could bring them back into <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and install them in this Croatian state, which would then be a satellite of the Axis powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So there was always the underground; and it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as much as it might have been in other parts of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  What happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  When the war broke out in 1939, <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And uh, in 1940 <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and could not achieve a victory there. </span><span class="sentence" id="81"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> out of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">In fact, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> secured; because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> planned to attack the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops go through <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , so that they can then attack <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The Yugoslav government agreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">This was in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">An anti- Fascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti- German. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was 1n defiance, direct defiance of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And in response to that, in April 1941, he ordered that <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> be attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="89"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> all attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and defeated its army 1n about fourteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And that Croatian state was then established under the name the "Independent State of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And the exiled nationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that state. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They called themselves "UstaSa." </span><span class="sentence" id="93">That means, uh, "Men of the Uprising." </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And immediately, within the first week, they began to introduce anti-Jewish legislation. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Not only Jews, but also the Serbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Orthodox Serbs were really on their list of destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And Gypsies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Tell us what was in that legislation and how did it affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  The legislation was sweeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The Jews, there was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The Jews had to wear a yellow, uh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for "Jew" in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslav</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in a certain section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They had to surrender cameras, radios, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was a preliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish population into numbness. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because it was very sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Almost upon arrival of these...of the UstaSa. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed them as being Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they began some deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There...those were times, they were somewhat chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I mean, it was a new state. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There was chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The UstaSa were not that organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic struggle, for the control of that state. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And the Germans won that control. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The Italians, who had banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">In other words, it is important to understand that after the victory over <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , the Axis powers dismembered <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There was no more <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> as a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There was the Independent State of Croatia; <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ; <span class="REGION">western Yugoslavia</span> --that 1s, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> --was divided between the Germans and Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And most important, for my story, the Italians occupied that <span class="DLF">Adriatic coast</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and most of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They also annexed part of that <span class="DLF">coast</span> --the best part, the richest for tourism--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> , and made it part of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So that was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> [were] being slowly herded together, and taken to various camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen camps operating in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The Germans were not in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">This was all...they were all run by the UstaSa. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was such that even the Germans were horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">In their internal memoranda, they called it the "Balkan bestiality." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">At one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a transport was being formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> where they all perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was arrested on a certain day. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I was then sixteen at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The agent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my father's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">This was unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that "You probably mean me, and not my son." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The detective insisted, "No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him." </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So my father said, "Well, I'll come with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Of course, he couldn't go into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transitory camp</span> ; and so I was taken there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">This was on the outskirts of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , where fairs were held usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families, pushed against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the UstaSa, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We didn't know at all what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Now we know what happened to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">As I said, they were taken to the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pag</span> , P - A - G; and they all perished there under horrible circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call, when my name came up, the UstaSa officer in charge said, "Are you here alone?" </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Since they had families. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He said, "Take your things and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He could have easily said, "Bring his family." </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now this was past curfew time. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I had no paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and I wasn't...no patrol found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And my parents thought they had lost me already. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was then that my parents decided that we must do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But escape where? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">The partisans were not yet active. </span><span class="sentence" id="162"><span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was surrounded by <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that were already under German domination. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And then the decision was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Let us try to somehow escape to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Maybe the Italians will let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Because we didn't really know anything about Fascist Italy. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Since the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> was oriented toward <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the German-speaking Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was the place to go for a vacation maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were concerned, was unknown to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">To us, this was a gamble. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And my father obtained some sort of pass which could be gotten for some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was just a pass that said that we could be let out of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">With this pass, without the yellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We wanted to go actually to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> --<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalato</span> , in Italian--which then was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> , which then became <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And we thought if we reached that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> somehow, as many Jews did, we would be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">On the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalato</span> , however, some troubles developed to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was turned back; and we landed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was the worst <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And this was the city of the Croatian Nationalists, where the UstaSa movement was born--the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gospi_--in</span> a desolate part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with curfews, patrols, and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for Jews just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gosp1</span> _. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We didn't know that, but there it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The three of us, plus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we coalesced into a small group, milling around at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then trying to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">On the way, we just knocked on a <span class="DLF">door</span> --the first <span class="BUILDING">peasant house</span> we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Fortunately, this was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> owned by an old Serb woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And the Serbs were, at that time, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So she understood our plight. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But she was afraid of harboring us. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">She said she could keep us only for so many hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We...we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not knowing what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We couldn't go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We couldn't go forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We had false documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">To all intents and purposes, it seemed a completely impossible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But again, we were lucky in that there was an <span class="BUILDING">Italian garrison</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> --as there were Italian garrisons all over the <span class="REGION">region</span> which was not far from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , from the <span class="DLF">coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I spoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> days. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And we told them two words: "ebrei"--which means Jews, [and] "paura"--fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They immediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And they told us to quickly go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , "calma"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Their sergeant came. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was easier to communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He said, "Stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We didn't believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We thought he just said nice things. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">How would he, who 1s he, didn't want any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He never knew us, but he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He said he couldn't get a pass for us; but at midnight he will come with a few soldiers and he will put us on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian military train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And there...and doing that would be enough to smuggle us into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Again, we were quite skeptical. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Why would he do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And this was unforgettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Uh, at night Italian soldiers carrying our bags and rucksacks, marching us--protectively--to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> with this sergeant, waiting for an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian military train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came, he told us to get in; and he himself boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Now, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was full of Italian soldiers who immediately gave <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to the...to my mother and other ladies in the small group, offered us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I think he just said, "These are refugees." </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And as soon as you heard the word...he said the word "refugee" to Italians, they immediately...their hearts melted. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Whether it was an Italian refugee or a Jewish refugee, didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They didn't protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">After all, we were civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We had no right to be on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Then, at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , there were difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Now, I'm talking about the <span class="DLF">border</span> with <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> proper; because that whole scheme of getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> , had to be abandoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He wanted us to go to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flume</span> [Croatian: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijeka</span> ], from where we could go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> --which was then <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> --and we would be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He got us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They didn't know what to do with us, so they put us into the <span class="BUILDING">Customs House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He went to the authorities and said, "Here are these refugees; they haven't had anything to eat or drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They've got to be given something." </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And some women's organization came, and they gave us orangeade and sandwiches to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we stayed there almost a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He left us, because he was assured by the authorities that we could stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">He shook hands with us and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We never knew his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">However, at night, we were surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The authorities really did not allow us to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They put us back on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and pushed us back into <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We pleaded with the, uh, Italian military police, the Carabinieri, to give us back our documents, such as they were, so the UstaSa would not see that we are being pushed back as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Maybe that way we could escape, go back and try again. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the Carabinieri complied with our requests. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So we made it back again, and we went all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We were totally exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was the most foolish thing to do, but we didn't really know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And when we came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> --this was only a few days later--it had already been taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">In the meantime, they came to search for us, to arrest all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Not having found us, they gave the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to a functionary of the UstaSa, who lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And the neighbors told us to just run away, because they were looking for us, as they were for other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So we went again, and tried the same thing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">This time we made it across the <span class="DLF">border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  How did you get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  We got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> just before the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> --again at random--and knocked on a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And a peasant woman opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We actually told her who we were, that we were looking...we had money, we were looking for someone to smuggle us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">We knew that near the <span class="DLF">border</span> , there were always smugglers. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">That is, there was always traffic from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and back; and that possibly the peasants would know some secret <span class="DLF">path</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh, this, uh, woman knew some people who took us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We were not alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We were also again in a group maybe of ten, twelve people. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Not just the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This time we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And we lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> ,’ in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , for one month. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But the Italian police found us after one month. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They arrested my father and myself, kept us in for one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The Police Commissioner was very embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that was after the sergeant, the experience with the sergeant, which told us something about the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Now the Commissioner of Police, when my father and I were brought to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he got up and he shook hands with us and asked us to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">This was not the Commissioner of Police that we expected to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And he told us that he has no power to do anything, but he will leave our <span class="DLF">cell door</span> open-- unlocked--as a symbol that we are not really prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">In the morning, we will be reunited with our wives and mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">There were other Jews in that same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They were all picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And so there was a sizable group of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We were being marched to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And we thought, "My God. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Again they're going to push us back into <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But they didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">By that time--and we know this now--their policy has changed ...had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The policy of returning Jews or not letting them stay lasted only in the very first weeks of the UstaSa regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Once the Italians grasped...understood what was going on with the Jews and the Serbs, and the Gypsies, they did not push anybody anymore across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They engaged in intense activity as to what's to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But we have documents today that clearly show that neither the Governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> nor the Italian General [ Vittorio] Ambrosio 1n charge of the Second Army on that <span class="REGION">territory</span> had any intentions to return us into the UstaSa hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> took us to former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cirquenizza</span> --C-I-R-Q-U-E-N-I-Z-Z-A [Croatian: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crikvenica]--</span> where, uh, we used to go for summer vacation, as many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Fifth Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">By that time there were some fifty or sixty, a small group of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We ' In an article published in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Midstream</span> in June/July 1983, Mr. Herzer identified this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">SuSak</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Firume</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">settled there and we had, of course, representatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">My father was one of the oldest among the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">He spoke some Italian, so naturally he represented us. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He went to the Major in charge of civilian affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">He received him as if he were a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He said, "You are protected, and you are under Italian protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Give us your names, your addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The UstaSa, who have the civil authority, won't be able to do you any physical harm." </span><span class="sentence" id="303">As an example, the UstaSa did not want to give us ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The Italians forced them to give us ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The UstaSa said we have to wear those signs--again, yellow signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The Italians told us, "Well, let them have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We must give in on some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But physically, they will not be able to harm you, deport you, or put you in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Now, our numbers increased; because my experience roughly speaking was repeated in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Between four and five thousand Croatian Jews--almost all that survived--found their way to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian occupation zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Either to the <span class="REGION">zone</span> --we were in a <span class="REGION">zone</span> , not yet in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> --or to the annexed part of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , which was much safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There were no Croatians there at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But we were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">All came and started a very extraordinary period in my life, because we developed close relations with the Italian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Italian officers started dating Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Uh, the Italian major came to play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> with my parents and another Jewish lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He brought me dictionaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They brought us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Uh, there were two things that stand out. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">One, that two weeks roughly I think after our arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crikvenica</span> was Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And, uh, somehow the Italian major--whose name was Cipolla--learned this high holiday was at hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He called my father, and told him that he had reserved a <span class="INT_SPACE">school room</span> for the services. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">He abolished the curfew; because this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> , due to guerrilla activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He abolished the, uh, the ban on assembly which they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">You had to special permission if you had... As you normally have to have, in areas of martial law. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And so we actually could celebrate Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And he sent a lieutenant as his representative, who gave a little speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was incredible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  How many people were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And describe the scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We're talking about Yom Kippur, Kol Nidre in a <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">This... (PAUSE) I don't think there were more than thirty, forty people there at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The numbers increased, but this was very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">This was somewhere in October '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was still early. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">October '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It wasn't an elaborate service, but... And I don't even know and remember who held the services, who actually led; but there is always somebody you can find, among thirty Jews, somebody who would be able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We could read, after all, Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We... somebody had, uh, the prayer books. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And this was, of course, morally and psychologically, a tremendous boost. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And shortly thereafter, we had another proof that they went--the Italians--beyond accepting us, or receiving us, or protecting us; when they invited all of us to a performance given for the Italian troops by an Italian military group of entertainers. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And they gave us the place of honor, the first row. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And, uh, it was really, I must say, uh, a...a moment that I can't forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">When, uh, we stood up. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The Italian national anthem was played. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The anthem of an Axis power, of the closest ally of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And here are twenty, thirty Jews as their guests of honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We couldn't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was just like a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">This situation existed until November '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We studied Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We felt safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We, of course, wrote furiously to those who survived the initial deportations to come to the <span class="REGION">zone</span> in...1n whatever way possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The connections established with the Italian officers-- that is, the connections we establish with them--were very productive. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Because these officers were able to go, of course, anywhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Wherever they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And they would go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> ; and bring the parents, bring the sisters and bring the relatives of the Jews who were already in their <span class="REGION">zone</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  And they did that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  We, we knew that the Allies had landed not only in <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> , but also <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So that the <span class="DLF">line</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on the Adriatic coast, was already in Anglo-American hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Now to get there, one had to go quite some distance--uh, island-hopping, so to say, because there are many <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> , in the midst of uncertainty. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Who is on the next <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">How is the population? </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Are they pro-German, pro-UstaSa, or what? </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Everywhere we went, we saw white flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The poor people on those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> who suffered hunger anyway, they wanted to say they surrendered to whoever comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They're not going to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They were small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> , and I think that helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We didn't come as...we just came as a small group. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And it's not clear to me how my parents and other, uh, grown-ups managed to arrange. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I know it was money to pay someone to take us in a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to the next <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The conditions were bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It was December, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> was not, uh, a very calm <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But this was also good, because German patrols didn't go out very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So we managed to reach a large island of Vis, V -I- S. On that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> there were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British torpedo boats</span> and Partisans; but at that time, the Partisans were Stalinists. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Did not allow any contact with the British, so that we could not contact them. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Fortunately, there were other refugees--not Jewish refugees, but just refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">People from...running away from the horrible conditions of the multiple civil wars within <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">There were Quislings, the Partisans, the Chetniks and all the other groups fighting each other; and many people just couldn't stand it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was full of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And all I can remember is that at one point all of us were picked up by a British ship military ship. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Actually, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger ship</span> which they requisitioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And it brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But the British would not let us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They directed us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Taranto</span> , all the way in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And from there, we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">The British had camps at the very heel of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And so we landed again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We were fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And the fate that the British ordained for us was to transfer us to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , to some camps...tent camps outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">The problem is...was that we were then surrounded by refugees; and among those refugees were also former UstaSa and elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Because the war was coming to a close; and those days people would then run simply and cross and defect from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the winning <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And we decided to get out of that camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And that was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We had to sign some papers; and then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> --which was under the British Eighth Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So that this was really then the liberation, in a sense, for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We were then safe.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , the British Army employed masses of refugees--and later also Italians, who were only considered co-belligerents--for all kinds of duties, from menial to duties of translators. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I got a job within one week with the British Field Security as translator and typist; because I knew English by that time, having studied very hard 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I didn't know what it sounded like, but I still knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But by that time I knew Italian and Serb-Croatian and German; and there were always questions and documents and, uh, interrogations of...of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And it was chaotic, to say the least, also in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And they needed somebody to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So that was a job which then paid and gave us rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was very easy, in a way, it seemed, to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">My mother got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She worked for a British outfit called Toch- H (ph), which served tea and crumpets to the British officers and commissioned...non- commissioned officers, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So she got a job there because she knew English from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And finally, my father even found employment in censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Uh, they had a vast <span class="BUILDING">Censorship Office</span> ; uh, and he would read all these letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And sometimes letters by people that he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And he would just say, "Hello, here are my greetings," and "Why are you writing so much?," </span><span class="sentence" id="539">or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Those were very good times. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Now we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Uh, all I thought of was to resume my life somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But as I say, there was, of course, physical safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And then the gratitude we felt toward the Italians, and the way the Italians even then received us. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I, uh, studied for my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , for <span class="BUILDING">Italian high school</span> final exam--which is not very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So I studied at night with a professor while I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And, uh, again, they ...1n the test, the test they gave me, the oral test, they chose questions that they knew I would answer with greater ease than some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They didn't ask me obscure questions about Italian history, but something that they felt I could answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So their attitude toward refugees are people in trouble carried through. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Even though at that time, for example, there were great difficulties with <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> ; because <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> wanted <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And we were... Yugoslavs would have been enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And they never were very friendly, because the two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> have always had a great deal of difficulty because of <span class="COUNTRY">Dalmatia</span> --coveted by <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And yet, on a personal level, I never experienced that. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I spoke very good Italian, which helped; because if you speak Italian, the Italians generally will feel this is quite an honor to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Somebody took the trouble to study the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So my difficulties were over. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">But I didn't yet quite realize how rare the Italian gesture was, because the full impact of the Holocaust was not known. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I'm talking now about 1944, '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It wasn't known. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It came out differently and slowly; and gradually, one realized what...what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And what could have happened to us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Lived in the middle of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was assigned to us by the British military authorities that assigned empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> to refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Because many Italians had fled. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Fled the bombing; or many Fascists fled, thinking that they would be punished if caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So there were many <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> free. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So we lived there in this assigned apartment. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I'm sure the rent was almost zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I worked, in the beginning; and this was enough to feed us, because I got rations plus money. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I then got another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">After the job with the Field Security, I got a job teaching English to Yugoslav partisans who were in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> all around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So I worked for the British Council, which 1s like the Voice of America. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">It is a similar organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Uh, and they paid quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So I...we were able to really be independent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  It sounds as if you lived really fairly comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  Yes, I...I think we...we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Because with two of us working, and then three of us working, surely. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Someone told me go the American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I went there, and it was early in the formation of the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I'm using the word "Joint" - it's the American Joint Distribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Was...and they said, "Yes, you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">You'll work for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">If you know these languages, fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> ; and my parents then moved later, a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee from '46 until '48. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I was an administrative secretary in the HaSharot Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We dealt with the refugees of the, of the Brichah, the...the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who sought to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> --later <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They reached <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , from all the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps;</span> but before that, they were housed in various <span class="NPIP">places</span> 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And then they would generally secretly embark and hope not to be intercepted by the British and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Well, I worked in that department, in an administrative capacity to somebody; and did translations and dictations and so on, visiting those HaSharot, listening to...to what they needed, their needs, their requests, making out requisitions and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">This was until 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  Tell me... Talk about the Joint during this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">You were really in the middle of all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">What was the organization itself like during this period and what kinds of things did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Let's talk about the organization first. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">What it was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">How big was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">How active were the people who worked for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  The upper management came from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ; and, uh, the, uh, middle management and support staff was all recruited from refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Not so much locally, not...not the Italians; but refugees, uh, who came from various countries of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">The Yugoslavs were very numerous, because obviously there were many Yugoslavs who found themselves in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But there were Poles, and Germans and Austrians, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">There was a very mixed staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">The activities that had to deal with the actual illegal immigration were not known to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They...I mean, they...they kept it well hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I mean, I did not overtly have you know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I... only surmised that something was going on; when suddenly, two HaSharot were closed and nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But it had to be done this way, because the British of course didn't just want to intercept the immigrants or potential immigrants at <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But they pressured the Italian government to use their police surveillance to prevent the embarkation of Jews bent on...on breaking the blockade to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So it had to be really kept very secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I know it was because none...none of the co-workers that I remember knew anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">There were a few individuals, I remember, who were Sabras; and they were, I think, in charge of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And they did not have a clear job. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It was never clear to me what they were doing; but they spoke perfect Hebrew, and they looked to me like the kind of guys who could and would organize and had no fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Very decisive men, who could not only lead a meeting but also lead people at night through a <span class="DLF">mine field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That much I...I still remember; but I didn't have direct, any direct work. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I didn't take part in that.(PAUSE) The question was for everyone, when the war ended, what do to, where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We didn't want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> --which was at that time not just Communist, but Stalinist Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And we just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Certainly my father would not go, and I would do whatever he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">At that time, I wasn't on my own; and I never had any desire to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The question was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on one hand, or the New World. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But out of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Many people wanted out, just out. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And, uh, I received a Hillel B'nai B'rith scholarship 1n '48, which then decided. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And the decision was made then for me, obviously, that I could go and study, make up the lost time. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Because somehow, in the narrow vision, that's all I saw--that I lost these years, and I had to make them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">That was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Especially after the shock--which was a big shock to me--that now that I survived, I really couldn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Because I always wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I mean, in my dreams or in my feelings and hopes, that if I survive, the war is over, we're only a few miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , we will go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I'll find some friends; and, uh, somehow you go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I never thought of really leaving while I was under the Italian control. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But then afterwards, it became clear that there was no back, that there were no friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , that independent state of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> we talked about, the <span class="REGION">Ustasa Croatia</span> , contained about thirty thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But no more than, uh, fifteen percent survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So really, even apart from the regime, there was no real going back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  It must have been very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  This was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was very, uh...in a way it was, to realize that you're 1n exile, in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Because it is, after all, we couldn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">We could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But in 1948, when Tito broke with Soviets and allowed the Jews to leave, practically all Yugoslav Jews left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Not all, but practically all. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They just weren't happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But not because of any antisemitism, but just the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">After all, the conditions were just the way they are today in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  So you had this B'nai B'rith scholarship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  To where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  To the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I said I wanted to study engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And, uh, then they gave scholarship to quite a few individuals who had to prove that they knew English, and so on and so on, and finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Which wasn't easy in Europe to achieve. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But they choose...they chose the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; and they sent me to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> in 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I, uh, studied electrical engineering, and I graduated in 1951 because I had some courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I...I went to <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> and took some engineering courses also. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So they recognized that. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I went summers, and speeded up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  Did your parents come with you, and how?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">That was probably the worst thing, uh, in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">That we were together during the war, and could not really be together afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Because they were...applied for, on a quota, for a visa to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ; and, uh, there was a spot on my father's lungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And an American doctor said this is TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And from that moment on--no matter what other doctors said or what other tests were conducted showing that it's a dead process, not an active process, because my father was a heavy smoker--that original decision could not be rescinded. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But my mother was forced to come here so she would not loose her <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">She came in 1949 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Had to leave him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">In 1949, he was already 66 years old; and he could never get this entry visa, even though later on he came as a visitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">My mother went there from back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">By that time, they had no more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They had no more way; you know, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here, and so they were getting some help from, uh, United Nations refugee organization, UNRRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But we had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and they told them to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And I became a citizen here in 1955, and so I was able to then leave and go and visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But, uh, those were great efforts. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And I tried to... You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to doctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, "No, this is obviously not an open process. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And even if it were, so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I mean, the man can be put into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in under observation." </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But they wouldn't let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">This was part of a...at that time, of an effort to let as few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh, research that was done much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I came as a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I had to have a student visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I...my...my number wasn't up. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So that if you commit a crime, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> can send you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But I had no national passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I had to renounce my Yugoslav citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I was stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">How can you then get a student visa? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So again, the Italians said, "Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> if the Americans push you out." </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And that should convince the Consul that he could give me the visa; which they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  So you came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">You went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> ; and stayed one more year to get a Master's. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I almost got it, but I didn't quite get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from, uh, <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> and started working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  As an engineer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  As an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the Master's, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more and more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">The...the Italian story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It's quite a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Ivo, I'd like to back up a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">The island-hopping you did in order to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Can you describe it in a little more detail? </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Uh, we don't uh... Did people take out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sailboats</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Did you do this at night? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">How was this done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  This was mostly...mostly small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor boats</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sail boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">It's all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">There were maybe five or six <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> , when I was island-hopping, before the big one. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I remember, on one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> we were so...we were tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We somehow found our way to...to the local teachers--a married couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">They gave us their <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> to use for that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I don't know how, because I was not involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">There was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And then there was another group and they came to the same <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , and so you have a group, so to say, travelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And the last big hop to the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , where the British were, there we had a big boat--70-ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And, uh, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was very bad, and there were too many of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">What they did is, they left the older people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> ; and us, the younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , so we wouldn't be washed away by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was mined; but the <span class="DLF">mines</span> were much deeper than this small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , relatively small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Seventy tons is not very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So we were also safe that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh air, even though there were waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But I don't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  And you have no sense of how this was organized, or how it was done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">There was no...that we would <span class="DLF">line</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would be paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , or some <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And then, maybe, find somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Again, we have some money or clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I remember, we gave some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> --as a contribution which was more important than money; because money really didn't mean much at that rate. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But I don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  When the British interned you, as it were, uh, again... How... You never, in fact, got taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">You were...you were... what was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="751">You were under the British control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  What was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  We were housed in <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and abandoned <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">We slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">stone floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Uh, 1t was typical refugee, refugee-type situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">You know, if you can imagine the Red Cross... When people are evacuated--the disaster, you know, make-shift quarters. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">But we were fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Uh, and I don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="761">It wasn't only Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Uh, we heard--but we were not told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was destined for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">El Saff</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">That was the place somewhere outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I remember my father said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Not one more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="767">If we can get out of here, let's get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Somehow we will be able to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Because uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It will be possible to make a...to exist, rather than in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Only proved to be true. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But we had no contact with the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going on; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I didn't know, I did not know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I was still a little dizzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I was... END OF VIDEOTAPE ... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the rescue is now becoming known. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Even though it involved few people, compared to the tremendous tragedy of the Jewish nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Still, there were so few positive episodes 1n the Holocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And I'm glad now that I see that books are coming out and articles, research 1s being done; that this is finally, after 40 years, becoming known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Ivo, thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span>
