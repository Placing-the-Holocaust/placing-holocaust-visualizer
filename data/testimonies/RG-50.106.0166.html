QUESTION:  And where were your born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born on June 25", 1929, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Germ -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> is now Polish, but it was German at that point 1n time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about your family background. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">How far back did your family go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My family actually went very far back, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I have records to -- 0-of <span class="DLF">graves</span> having been erected in -- just right after the Napoleonic war, the Franco- Prussian War. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And of all strange things, one of the <span class="DLF">graves</span> that may have survived all the fighting in that <span class="REGION">area</span> 1s still standing today. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I managed to get a picture of it just very recently on the web. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And we were very excited to see that gravestone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  What -- what was your father’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  My father was Walter James Fischer. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in his native <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> where most of my forebears were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was -- is June 23, 2005 the professional person in his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">His parents were merchants, they had a wonderful -- probably the largest toyshop in all of <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , and he chose not to go into that kind of work, perhaps because he was in the army in -- in the first World War, and fought in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , fought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verdun</span> , came back and -- and at that point he was only 16 or 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And came back totally paralyzed by what he had seen; he was a litter bearer in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and decided that medicine would be his calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">S - my grandmother and grandfather had the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , both of them worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My grandmother worked alongside her husband and so did her sister and his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They were two brothers married to two sisters, and so it was definitely a family affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And their parents, my great-grandparents were also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">What they did I’m really not sure, but in -- in business of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The business, interestingly enough -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the business was housed 1s standing today in the very same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was one of the few <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that survived the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rink</span> , the main square of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , right opposite the <span class="BUILDING">court buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It’s number 26 on -- number 36, excuse me, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rink</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I have seen reproductions of that <span class="REGION">area</span> , or photographs of that <span class="REGION">area</span> and sure enough, it’s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The Poles have really taken a great deal of trouble to try to rebuild that <span class="REGION">area</span> as it was, and I think s -- handled it very successfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My forbearers on my mother’s side were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birnbaum</span> , which is really on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">What -- my June 23, 2005 grandfather on my mother’s side was in the canning business, and was the first canner who did diabetic fruits in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , canned diabetic fruits. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And had the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and so my mother grew up really in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in this -- 1t’s suburban now, but it was really <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when she grew up, and that she loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And she did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , but the rest of the time she was a country girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  And was she a housewife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Actually, she was, although she went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and upon graduating from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> went to a sort of a finishing school for girls and studied music. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She had a magnificent voice, and was very nicely trained, and sang eventually professionally, in part, but always sang for the high holidays at <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And in fact, I came across a letter just the other day, the head of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , which was one of the places where we lived, thanked her for making the service so beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  In talking about the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , can you tell a little bit about how religious your family was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  My grandparents on both sides were fairly religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My father was pretty much of a free thinker. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My mother was more religious than he, but I think both of them became very, very much more religious when we crossed over to this side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Did you, as a small child, remember celebrating any holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Oh yes, we always celebrated holidays and I particularly remember Sukkot in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , which is the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I really remember best of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was in the -- in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> , which was a number of hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> going towards the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> and the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , we were sort of in a -- very close, within walking distance of the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , because I remember walking with my mother to have buttermilk on the Polish side of the <span class="DLF">border</span> because the farmer -- that farmer’s buttermilk was by all means the very best, and so we walked across <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> and over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to get our buttermilk. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Very nice memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  So did you celebrate Shabbat, did you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  We celebrated Shabbat, my mother kindled candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We celebrated Passover, but mostly we celebrated our Passovers, and I have very vivid memories with very dear friends who were Orthodox, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And we s -- I went to services on Saturday mornings, not with my parents, but with a friend of theirs who took me not only to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Saturday mornings, but took me out for a krimmelhelmchen which was a poppy seed roll o-on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And that made a great impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But my grandpar -- my grandmother -- I think all of them were really liberal Jews rather than Orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I think tha-that it was not named Conservative, I think June 23, 2005 that branch of Jewry in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was called the liberal branch and we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> there rather than the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Were your parents very politically active?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  They had very strong opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Active, I wouldn’t say, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Ma -- I think my father’s days were so full with his -- with his work, and with work for the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He was very often asked to be the s -- the psychiatrist who gave opinions in court cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And they were very active at their <span class="BUILDING">lodge</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">B’nai Brith lodge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">That I do remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Let’s just get a sense of a structure here with how long you lived where. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Y-You said you were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , and how long did you live there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We were born -- I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When my father w -- a-already was working in a <span class="REGION">suburban area</span> -- <span class="REGION">area</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Obernigk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">O-b-e-r-n-i-g-k, | think. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and had a large <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric hospital</span> in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And there he had his job and there we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Now, I was very little and really have no memories other than picture memories of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that my grandparents had the <span class="BUILDING">canning factory</span> in, so this all worked out very nicely in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We moved, I believe it was 1934 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , R-a-t-i-b-o-r, it 1s now also in Polish hands and has changed its name just a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I think when we moved we -- I was 1 -- going into <span class="BUILDING">nursery kindergarten</span> , and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of the Ursuline sisters and I June 23, 2005 loved my time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They were so good to us, and they -- I learned so many little skills, and I even still have the little needle book that I embroidered for my mother, my first timid effort at working with fibers, and it was very precious to my mother, and a little moth-eaten but I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And we moved into our first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="BUILDING">Svingerstrasser 17</span> and within a month or two we were asked to leave because we were unwanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> didn’t realize that somebody with the name of Fischer could be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And so we moved and found a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on number 23 Svingerstrasser, and I have very vivid memories of it, I could draw the plan of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was a first floor walk-up, very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my father was able to have his practice right in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The first <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was very large, with -- I can’t think of the English word for the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It’s a-a-an [indecipherable] a a no -- a no -- a knockout, a glass knockout so that one could really watch the <span class="DLF">street</span> up and down and see what’s going on and it was an up -- first floor, upstairs, and large. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to us was the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And during the day it was the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> for the patients and in the evening it was the <span class="INT_SPACE">gentlemen’s room</span> to have cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And as we walked down the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to the left in which Maria, our very dear domestic help who lived with us, did her thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then further down, of course, was the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and my parent’s <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  So you were an only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  I -- yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  My mother always said Mr. Hitler saw to it that I was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They would- they were ready to have a rather lar -- and had hoped for a rather large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">However, I did acquire a brother a little later on, but that’s another story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Were either of your parents artistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  My mother sang very beautifully and my father always thought that he might have, if he had not become a physician he might have become an architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So I think yes, I would say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They both had extremely fine taste in things that they chose to buy, and yeah, I would s -- and my mother’s singing, of course, was quite -- quite remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  What languages did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  German only. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My mother knew some French and my father studied Greek and Latin in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and -- but of course it was the reading language of Greek and Latin, I don’t know that he spoke it, other than memorized poetry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Was it a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> -- we’re now talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> because you said you didn’t really remember before that, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  That’s right, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  Yeah, so can you -- was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes, it was definitely a mixed -- a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I don’t think that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> had a specifically Jewish area, I think we were all very well here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I-I cannot think of -- of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we lived was -- was a nicely treed neighborhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was a main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and yet it had <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on it and in the back of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a -- every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had its own little <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and so we raised strawberries. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It was a small <span class="DLF">garden</span> , but we raised strawberries and flowers and there was a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , in the back of the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , big enough to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and maybe six or eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and I know my mother’s book club met there in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And of course, I loved playing in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I had a nanny who made sure that I learned how to grow things and to weed, and to take care of flowers and who was really my steady companion after I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So did you play with any of the other chil-children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> or just with your nanny after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  You know, it was easy, it was -- well, not -- perhaps not the children in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> because across from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> of that part of the province. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So there were not that many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that had children in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  You’re talking about <span class="BUILDING">judicial courts</span> , not -- June 23, 2005
ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Judicial courts</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  -- not <span class="DLF">courtyards</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, <span class="BUILDING">judicial courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But one usually made appointments with one’s friends and after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they could come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was always -- I always had a lot of little friends who came over and whose company I enjoyed and whose <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> I went to as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Not for very long, but for awhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Were these Jewish and non-Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  We had -- I had very close Jewish and non-Jewish friends, and I was very fortunate enough to have the non-Jewish friends because some of them were really lovely children with whom I enjoyed being together. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we were together really, until the time when it was no longer allowed that these little girls, particularly, could come and visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My very dearest friend was a young girl by the name of Ushi Blaut, whose father was an architect for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and who was threatened to lose his job if his little girl came and played with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I think maybe that was the first awakening that things were very strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  That was your first awakening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  My first awakening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  And -- and what was -- do you remember -- granted, you were very young, but do you remember any thoughts you had at that time, or what that meant to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">June 23, 2005
ANSWER:  It meant a great deal to me because we saw very much eye to eye and we loved being naughty together. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I couldn’t understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I couldn’t -- I could see her at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but yet she couldn’t come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I couldn’t visit her any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And that -- that started -- I mean, that kind of began and then it was like something rolling on and on and on and it -- and it was -- I tell you, the one thing that I do remember is by going through some old photographs, I did find out that she was allowed to come to my birthday party and I think that must have meant a lot to me, and it was very special, but on a day to day basis, she couldn’t visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Do you remember which birthday party it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I think it was my fifth -- fifth and sixth birthday parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Now, I -- as I say, I could not visit her, she could not visit me, but birthday parties seemed to be kosher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  So this would be 1934 - 35?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Hitler came into power in 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  °33.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  What was your very first memory of him?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Oh, first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very exciting because every child who started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was given a cornucopia filled with candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It’s called the Osted Tuete. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It -- the Easter cornucopia because <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started in spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I remember my friend Maya be -- who is a year older than I am, bringing me my cornucopia, I was still in June 23, 2005 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and she brought it to me and it was such an exciting occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">In fact, I have some pictures to verify the fact that it was really an occasion to be remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And of course, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> was an extremely formal affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We did not wear uniforms, but we were very regimented. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We had 42 children in a class of -- with one teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was from eight in the morning until one o’clock and then we were through. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We all brought our little lunch in lunchboxes that were hung around our necks, sort of second breakfasts, my mother called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And then we had -- when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after one o’clock it was dinner, dinnertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And the curriculum when we started included of course, the usual reading, writing and arithmetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But it also included art and music and <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> , and religious studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And to that end Halpy Befelt was my religious teacher, and I st-still have the Bible books that I used, written in German, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And once or twice a week he came, not to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself, but to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> close to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we all walked over and took our studies while the catechism was being taught to the Catholic children in the si -- in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I think boys and girls were separate in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I’m pri -- I’m sure they were, but to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> we all went together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  Did you experience ana -- any anti-Semitism from any of the other children at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or any of the non-Jewish teachers? </span><span class="sentence" id="284">June 23, 2005
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I think one of the eye opening experiences to me was when an in -- an inkwell was thrown at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I think I was terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It was by one of the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">That frightened me. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The other thing that really upset me was the fact that we had row monitors who were supposed to take care of people not speaking or misbehaving, and if they did talk to anybody or in any way misbehave, the name was given to the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And I remember getting more sh -- of my shares of -- of -- of censure to talking or misbehaving than I really should have gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And of course the result was that there was a stick that was used and was really -- we rece -- I received a whipping on both my hands every time I was unget zeigt, which meant, pointed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And that I think kind of really ma -- discouraged me. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And somehow the teachers, I don’t know, they turned their backs on these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">For what reason, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">For example, when we walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we -- and we had to wa- we saw a teacher, the -- the way to acknowledge it was to raise one’s hand and to say, heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I couldn’t do it and my parents absolutely forbade me to do it, and so I just curtsied. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And the teacher, instead of acknowledging the curtsy, would look the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But of course, she didn’t do anything to -- to upset me, but it was that- but in itself was upsetting to be looked over and not acknowledged. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And so it was with most of the teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think that they were being threatened and -- and we were being threatened in a way, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">That was a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  Were there pictures of Hitler in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I really don’t remember, but picture or not, he was there in -- you know, in -- just in so many little, small details. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">For example, there was every week or so, the pot was po -- passed around for money for Wintahilfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Winter help for meals for -- for indigent people or money being raised for unusual causes, and you realized, of course, that the causes were the party, but you had to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So that was another somewhat humiliating experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But the fact that the teacher believed the children who -- whose hate was really being taught at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and who took it out on -- on us, that was -- that was unpardonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Wa-Was this something you talked about with the other -- your other Jewish friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Did you ever talk about such things?</span></p>

ANSWER:  The Jewish instruction did not at this point in time, include Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was Biblical stories mostly and the Hebrew came later, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I wish it had come at -- at much earlier age because I was at a tremendous disadvantage when I changed <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , not having had early Hebrew training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  When you changed <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , is that what you mean?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Is -- yo-you had started to sing a song and I was saying something about music, and did you have any experience with the Jewish orchestra, the Kulturbund?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  Of course I didn’t, I was too young, but in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , for a -- a -- quite a while we were allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> -- to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and to the movies, and to musical events. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But the last one that -- the last <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> that I saw was in 1936 at the time of the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And after that we were not allowed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I think it was after that ti -- point in time that the Kubu -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kulturbund</span> came and did its outreach program to the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and brought wonderful people to sing and to play and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">One was, for example, Alexander Kipnis, who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And I remember my father, who was very active in these circles, getting all dressed up, I think it was tails. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And my mother in her very finest. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And it was an evening of Alexander Kipnis. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I remember this very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And there must have been other occasions when the Kubu came down, but this -- this 1s the one that stands out in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Also my father, who was a cigar smoker and a pipe smoker -- apparently before the performance there was a dinner and I think he pulled out his cigar and Alexander Kipnis made some very unpleasant remarks about people who smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It sticks out in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Where did this concert take place? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">June 23, 2005
ANSWER:  The concert was actually in the <span class="INT_SPACE">social hall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> must have been an old <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that was taken over by the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I remember it very lovingly, my father sat downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">My mother, who sang in the choir sat upstairs and I was allowed to sit with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Mother was not only a member of the choir, but did the solo work for Yizker service and sang just very, very beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">On the side of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a little <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and nice things went on including, in my memory, wonderful Sukkoth that was built each year with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> laden with fruits and vegetables and goodies to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And lovely decorations from a <span class="DLF">roof</span> that was made of greens, and it was just such a delightful time for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We also had -- I guess it was like a club, but I can’t -- I can’t be a hundred percent sure, but I know that I -- one Sunday I guess it was, we made lead candlesticks for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Very tiny lead candlesticks, we were allowed -- they had some forms and I guess they poured the lead and each child went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with two candlesticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They were big enough to take maybe a birthday candle, but it was so special and I still have them, and my granddaughter now has them. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they’ve come a long way and they were very dear. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But a lot went on in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because of the <span class="BUILDING">social hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">In fact, plays were given and there were readings and lectures came. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And all this happened 1n the <span class="BUILDING">social hall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which was pretty much in the downtown area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> was a pretty little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , not far from the June 23, 2005 <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for example, was the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I know that my mother went marketing many times during the week because of course we didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> , we only had an icebox. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And so she went marketing. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But besides getting fish and vegetables and things like that, they also had pottery, and it was called [speaks German]. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And they were wonderful pottery shapes and today, when you go into <span class="BUILDING">Pier One</span> , sometimes you can see pottery made in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It’s blue and white usually, and a very nice, repetitive, simple design, a repeat design on the pottery. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And very charming, very attractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It hasn’t changed a whole lot since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I kind of -- I think it’s very lovely and I recall going to <span class="BUILDING">potter’s market</span> with -- with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and do you know the -- where it was located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  I do not know the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I could draw it on a map, where it was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I don’t know the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but I do know it was on the corner of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">Marcus Furniture store</span> was and the st-story about the Marcus’s -- and that was my friend Vera Marcus’s family, story I remember very best was a party at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">A most unusual party. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It was a party that celebrated the safe arrival of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric refrigerator</span> from the United States of America that had a light in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I remember the children going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> , trying the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , trying to sneak in June 23, 2005 to see who it was who was opening and closing the lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And so much joy and so much merriment. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It was just a -- an unforgettable evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And --
QUESTION:  What -- what did you know about the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a young child? </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Did you have any idea of what it represented to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  I don’t know whether it was at this point in time or whether it was a little bit later because at this point I was what, seven or eight years old, but my greatest fear of perhaps coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was I was so afraid of the wolves. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Four legged ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I was petrified to think that I was going to have to live in log cabin with ice and snow all around and the wolves in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It was kind of frightening, but I think the nicest, nicest story that my father told me, and I'll remember to this day is, dear, he said, we’re going to a <span class="REGION">land</span> where even a Jew can become a person in the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And of course he was talking about Bernard Baruch. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I’m still a -- you can see, I’m still emotionally very touched by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It must have been a little bit later than living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , but it was -- it was certainly -- you asked me about what I knew about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Not a whole lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Did you ever hear any of the speeches on the r -- di -- on the radio that Hitler made, and if so, as a child, what did that do to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  I do remember hearing the speeches on the radio, on -- on -- and the yelling, and not really ever being able -- to this day I can’t follow the words, they were so June 23, 2005 garbled and mispronounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">But the tone of voice was so grating and the sheer shouts of adulation and adoration were frightening in themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I recall my father saying that he had heard, and I’m sure this is so, everybody in the audience felt the fuehrer was looking into his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">One was a -- a person was standing there, one in 10,000 but each one felt that he had been individually touched by this, you must say, charismatic character. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It was frightening and the music was frightening too. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The -- the -- the marching music and the boots, the boots, the boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">The beat of the boots, oh, very frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  You had spoken about one parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Were there many parades in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  There were a number, I wouldn’t say many, because we left before there were many, but there were quite a number that I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I even recall the night that there was a fire in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> not too far away from us and it was always a question as to why the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Was it a set fire because there were Jews living in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , or was it a Christmas three that -- it was on Christmas -- whether it was a Christmas tree that was responsible for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I don’t think anybody ever knew, but I associate that picture along also with the marching, the marching, the beat. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It may not have happened at the same time, but in my memory was very -- it must have been very close together. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And of course the -- the birthdays that were always celebrated, June 23, 2005 Hitler’s birthday and other notable occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And then there were always special parades.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  What -- what would you do on Hitler’s birthday?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  We would stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We would not go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was not worthwhile jeopardizing oneself. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And still we -- there in -- in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> were so much better off, I think, than people in the other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It was a little bit later in coming to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was as severe, but it was a little later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Were there banners, Nazi banners hanging from <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I believe that the -- the official <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was -- had banners on them -- flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And of course you couldn’t miss them, the bright red just was like blood hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">That I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I don’t -- you ask me about pictures of Hitler in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">There may have been the flag, but I’m not su -- I’m really not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">That I don’t recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Did you have to ha -- ever have to say heil Hitler in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , to the teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Oh, it must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It must have, but I don’t think that -- I don’t think that I raised my arm, but I couldn't swear to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">That I’m -- I’m a little unsure of, but I do know very well walking along the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and seeing my teachers, my various teachers and feeling totally hum -- not -- totally June 23, 2005 upset by the experience of not being recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Although, they tried to be fair with- | think with grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I don’t think that I was graded down in my -- in my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I’m sure I wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And I think in some respects these teachers were going through so much themselves, because usually, people who did become teachers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were very dedicated, true teachers with high ideals and high principles, but when your life depends on it, sometimes those principles change. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">End of Tape One, Side B June 23, 2005 Beginning Tape Two, Side A

And can you tell me about celebrating Passover in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  Well, my most vivid memory of si -- Passover Seders were celebrated with my parent’s very dear friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The Passover with the Weisbarts are really in my memory very frequently because they were absolutely wonderful Seders together. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">The Weisbarts had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> on the -- downtown in the rink area, the rink area of the downtown part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And it had all sorts of wonderful things like kitchen equipment and things for the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they lived above the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in a comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And just above them was a family by the name of Rechnitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And so on Seder evening, first night of Seder, Frau Weisbart, whose husband used to take me to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Saturday mornings and buy me those delicious little rolls, had us over -- I think they had no children of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I don’t believe -- or perhaps they did, but at any rate, they were not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He would conduct the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We were all interspersed, sitting in -- at a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I also remember having f -- my four cups of wine and being a little bit out of it one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But they had the most delicious sidoram. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">The food was unbelievable and a particularly good thing was a fish shodoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And I cannot spell it, I don’t know how to tell you about it, but it was fluffy June 23, 2005 and it was lemony and it had fish in it and it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And there were children around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and -- and a family by the name of Rechnitz, and it was a long evening, but always one that was a very, very happy one. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I think I remember two years that we were there, and I’m sure there were more years than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">What I think is particularly interesting, my husband is very interested in Jewish genealogy and I bring this in because it really does relate. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There was a request about people who knew people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> and in that general area of <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> and I answered it and I said yes, I do know the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and immediately a response came, would you happen to know a -- I’m looking for the name Rechnitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And it came from somebody who was originally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">This was a Jewish family who went, instead of going west went east and found refuge in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , lived out the war years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and then came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And the name of the lady who made the request was Yvonne Adler. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And I said, this is very, very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I said, I saw a Mrs. Adler present almost every day when O.J. Simpson trials were carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And they sometimes interviewed her, would you be the same one? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">She said yes, that was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So she wanted to know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rechnitz</span> , and I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And she said, I have no knowledge of their whereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I said, I can tell you nothing perhaps of the mother and father, but the two daughters survived and are living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">She was delighted, needless to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So then a little later a letter came. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">She June 23, 2005 said, you know, I have a relative who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Is that close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I said yes, I think within, sort of, walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And so we met in the relatives, and had them over for a cup of coffee and enjoyed meeting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And in between, every now and again, we still get on the <span class="DLF">genealogy line</span> and a -- express a word of greeting at Passover time, and just to stay little bit in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But it all revolved around the pass -- that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Passover table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I was able to fill a -- in a little bit on her family tree, and likewise she was able to fill in a little bit of my family tree, because a distant cousin of my father’s was an editor of the Jewish newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> during the years of the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He was an editor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , made a trip and stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , lived out the years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and apparently moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and unfortunately died there before we could make contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But she was able to help us out in that part of our family tree, so the internet’s a great thing.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And I’ve -- I have several memorable vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">My father and mother were great hikers and they loved to hike in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and so very frequently we went June 23, 2005 up to the Tetras, and the Riesengebirge and walked and enjoyed the fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I have happy memories of being put into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> driven by horses and being pulled through deep snow, and staying at a <span class="BUILDING">lodge</span> , and enjoying the -- the winter activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Mostly -- it mostly was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But -- and this was all very well and good, we could go and do our vacations, go on our vacations and stay at the <span class="BUILDING">lodges</span> , or at the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , but a time came when they were taking no more Jewish visitors and so the <span class="BUILDING">vacation places</span> were somewhat rationed and we had to go to places that were Jewish- run by Jewish families for Jewish families and that’s where we went on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I remember going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swinemitinde</span> , which is on the Baltic, where there was a very lovely vacation spot that catered to the Jewish trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Was called the Move. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And the Méve is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seagull</span> and it was on -- on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I stayed one year with my grandmother and one year I think I went with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Yes, I remember going with my mother, because I had to do homework, so not to fall behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> year was a little bit different, but I was allowed to -- to miss a little time, as long as my mother kept up with the assignments with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But it was interesting to think that we were really isolated even in where we could spend vacation time. </span><span class="sentence" id="514"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swinemunde</span> was rather fri -- to me was a little bit of a frightening <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be because the <span class="BUILDING">lodge</span> where I stayed with my grandmother sat opposite of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peenemiunde</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And that’s where the Germans were building their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U-boats</span> and we June 23, 2005 could see the white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And we were well aware of the fact that in 1937, there were definite attempts at getting ready for a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I -- I still see in my mind’s eye the white -- the very white painted <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> against very gray waters. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And rather frightening looking, they looked like sharks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  Wow, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Anything else in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> that you wanted to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  There was a very -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> was a very nice municipal swimming pool, and I was given my first instructions to swimming at that <span class="DLF">pool</span> , I was five years old and it was a funny way of learning how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">There were ro -- there were L-shaped rods -- well, actually probably fairly stable pipes that had ropes on them, that were suspended over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and we were hooked onto these ropes, and were 1n a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to study our strokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I -- I learned how to swim that way, I became a very good swimmer, very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And I remember it was a miserable day and I was about to take my test to pass to get my first card, and it required 15 minutes of uninterrupted swimming around the <span class="DLF">pool</span> , the edge of the <span class="DLF">pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And as I say, it was a dreary day, but my grandmother was visiting and she took me to the <span class="DLF">pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And I passed, I even did 20 minutes, but in order to get your card you had to jump in at the far end, into the deep water. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">This I could not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I was a totally petrified creature. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But they said well, if you will jump, if we put you on the harness and the rope, we will let you pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And of course I did, and I got my certificate and I was the happiest June 23, 2005 person in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But then that was closed to Jews after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was no longer allowed for Jewish people to -- to swim there. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But at least I learned how to swim.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  So then you went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while your parents settled -- were getting settled, and you were with your grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And how long did you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Actually, I think I probably was there less time than in my imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I was there a matter of maybe six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But I was so lonely, and my grandmother tried to make it so pleasant and comfortable for me, but I was away from my parents and I was very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I didn’t know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and I didn’t know Hebrew and all the children knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">However, the period came to an end and I saw a little bit of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I don’t remember very much of it, I remember where my grandmother lived, I remember where the beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was at which Dr. Joachim Prince was the- the m -- the rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I remember going to a service there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I re -- I remember going to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> and to -- doing things that little children like to do, but in general I have a very, very limited memory of what went on there, as opposed to the very accurate memory I have of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , where I c -- I can draw a map and I drew a map for my father some years back when -- and asked him whether he could go over this map with me to see whether my memory was accurate, and he said absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The memory of the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the dentist was, and where the <span class="BUILDING">knit shop</span> was and where June 23, 2005 the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> was and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But my memory of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is not at all that good. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">However, when I moved back to be with my family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , I have a much better memory of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , did you see lots of evidence of Nazi party symbols?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Actually, I don’t even remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I think there must have been -- there must have been, but I cannot visually pinpoint it as to where I might have seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">My grandmother, I am sure took me only to <span class="NPIP">places</span> that were permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It was interesting, my uncle, my mother’s younger brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He wanted very much to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and in 1935 or th -- ’36, he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and had a marvelous experience and wanted very, very much to go and settle there. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He saw the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and he wanted -- he had a chance to buy into Egged, the <span class="BUILDING">bus company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And my grandmother did not want to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and she would not give him the money, although it was there in spades. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The consequence was that Ludz did not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , had a terrible time leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my grandmother didn’t make it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">There was a wonderful opportunity where the wrong turn was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You ask did I see much evidence? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I just really honestly cannot recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Mm, I can’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Did your parents come visit you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  I don’t have memories of my parents visiting me at all because they were in the throes of moving and setting up a practice and trying to start getting things ready for June 23, 2005 a possible chance to -- to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My mother was very reluctant to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">She wanted more than -- she was sure this was all going to blow over. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">My father knew better, or he -- he did indeed know better. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He was sure that it wouldn’t and so at that point they were putting feelers out to see what might happen and what ha -- in effect happened was my father, being a physician was contacted by a number of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="REGION">South America</span> who were opening their <span class="DLF">doors</span> to physicians particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And it was either <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , and I’m sh -- not sure that I remember, but one of the -- one of those two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that made a most attractive offer, but my father, not Spanish speaking, not having had too much contact with the Spanish speaking population decided that might not be for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He also did not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I might add. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He was not at all set on going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But in the meantime, this wonderful telegram showed up, the one that really saved us when we were able to establish a family -- a blood connection to someone who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The question 1s, could we get into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> had a very tight quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">You might know the -- the book, 6,000 is too many and indeed I don’t even think that they got 6,000, or allowed 6,000 in. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But an -- at any rate, perhaps this is not what I -- what I should be -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So my father turned down <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , turned down <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but was absolutely positive that we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And so my mother decided she better learn how to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And so my mother, who was a singer June 23, 2005 and a lady who entertained beautifully and who was a -- a homemaker at heart decided that she would study and did study under ORT auspices, and studied physiotherapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">She had always loved a -- <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> and exercise and physical culture and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Right up her <span class="DLF">alley</span> , and she, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and studied physiotherapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And really, in effect, this step did keep body and soul together once we did come to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And she loved what she was doing, and she did it for many- well, for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So that was while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , she also started on that and got -- got into <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  And this is the Jewish Organization for Rehabilitation and Training. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">You said your father did not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Were your parents Zionists in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  My parents were not Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">You know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there was the big schism, the blue and white and the black and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He did not belong to the blue and white, although that changed too. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I mean, he was the strongest supporter of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that anybody could wish for, but at the time of our move he thought he could not take the weather in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">That was why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Y-You said he was a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He obvious -- he had an adult clientele. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Did he have any kind of more of a specialty or just general psychiatry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Actually, when he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> after he came back from the war, he studied neu-neurology and psychiatry, June 23, 2005 that was a -- a study that always went hand in hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And then he went for specialized work to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for awhile before he actually went into practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">He dealt mostly with adult patients and he did some very early work on mescaline, which became a drug a -- that was used for, I believe recreational, but it was a -- a very potent drug and he wrote one of the first papers on mescaline. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And he also dealt with bromism, which I’m not sure I really understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And then he got very interested and very involved with electric shock therapy, and was exceedingly successful with electroshock until it was sort of downplayed, and was not used any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And now things have come back and they are using electric shock therapy, under perhaps better circumstances because of the muscle relaxants and things that go with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">But my father was exceedingly successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I always felt he was out of favor with the establishment because his basis, from the earliest of all times he said, we will find biochemical and biologic basis for mental problems and diseases of the mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And of course when Freud became so popular, he was not at all in the swing. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And he stuck to his guns and I think the world has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He was more of a Jungian. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">He was extremely interested in what Jung had to tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And he really felt, and I think he was -- h-he -- it -- it came to pass that his way of thinking was quite right, quite on the ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And he worked until he was -- worked 1n his profession until he was 80 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And at that point in time he felt he couldn’t June 23, 2005 keep up with all the new medications and then decided that this was -- this was not, you know, good for the patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But he was quite successful in his -- in his work and he loved every minute of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He was the sort of person who, if somebody in the province, in <span class="REGION">New Brunswick</span> when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , was ill and needed his help, he got into his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and drove 300 miles without batting an eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">If the patient needed him, he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">He made housecalls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  That is some kind of a housecall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Oh my gosh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  All right, now you’re finished being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , you’re back with your family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , and how long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I would say probably only a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was a very full year though, because I had to get used to a new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and new surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I lived fairly far away from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the na -- [tape break]
QUESTION:  We were talking about your full year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  I --
QUESTION:  I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Ah yes, I moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and I was started in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , Raydia ar -- <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all children there were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">All, or most everyone was trying to leave and -- and I think everybody’s mind was such that -- June 23, 2005 that we were il -- we were losing people every day in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Raydia shula</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was a sizeable <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , much bigger than my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> , certainly ba -- much bigger than the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which was a small, little <span class="BUILDING">independent school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">This was a large <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and almost all the children there were being prepared, really, to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Hebrew was very big in the curriculum and I was painfully inadequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I did not like the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I only made two friends while I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was -- 1t was a very unhappy time of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">My father started his new practice and my grandmother -- my grandmother was having to rent out more <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> so that things would go reasonably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">She was made to give up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> at the point of a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">This beautiful <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">toy shop</span> , the biggest one in the entire province of Siles -- of <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , where people came from all over to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">In fact, the people who had the guta, the large <span class="DLF">farms</span> , these enormous <span class="DLF">farms</span> would bring their families in at Christmastime to do their shopping at <span class="BUILDING">Garson Frankel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">That was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , was the name actually of my great- grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had been in the family since 1826 and my grandmother was running it with her sister because both had lost their husbands, and they were made to sell it, as I say, because it was taken over. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I even have a clipping to the effect that it’s now Aryan, a big clipping from the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So she took in <span class="DLF">borders</span> into her big, beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everybody got along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But it was not as it was June 23, 2005 before. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Still, she was able to have help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because help was still allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">It was later that the help was not allowed to work for Jewish people any more, but at that time, in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , there was help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Were the <span class="DLF">borders</span> Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  I believe they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I do believe they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was one, two -- four stories high and the lowest part had the <span class="INT_SPACE">servant quarters</span> of the gardener, which became our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was on the lowest level, the entry level and there were lovely shrubs around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I remember there were lilacs that smelled so beautifully, and Lilies of the Valley. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Had a large <span class="DLF">iron gate</span> that opened up to allow <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to move in. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">We di -- she did not -- we did not have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">My father had his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , never drove a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> until he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And then there was the rote deala. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">That was a red <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> where when people came to visit, left their coats before being shown upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And that was, of course, my favorite <span class="NPIP">place</span> to play because everything was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Red satin or velvet or plush, very beautiful, with a <span class="DLF">bay window</span> looking out into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shrubs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And then the back or side part of it had a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">It was not a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for cooking though, it was an <span class="REGION">area</span> to do the laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And every week the laundresses came in and that was always great fun for me because they would hand wash everything on boards and then they would rinse it and then dry them, and then at the end of the day the two of them would take the sheets, one standing at one June 23, 2005 end, one at the other and they would pull them in order to dry them completely and my greatest joy was to stand underneath in the middle and have my hair fly up into the sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">It was such a joy and it was so much fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">That was so much fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We had a lovely gardener who took care of the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , which had a walk all around it so that one could stroll around a central green area. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And then the <span class="DLF">borders</span> were all peonies and roses and lovely shade flowers and tall trees. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And then there was a small <span class="DLF">garden arch</span> that led into the fruits and <span class="DLF">vegetable gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And we had gooseberries. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Never see gooseberries any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And red and white currants and raspberries and apple trees and peach trees. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It was -- it was a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> , it was absolutely lovely, and the gardener worked hard to do -- to keep it so. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had an enormous <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> so that one could sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and then look down on this lovely green area and then into the distance where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fruit trees</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B

ANSWER:  Once my grandmother was found and was able to establish contact with a distant relative who had emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> much earlier, and I wish I could tell you exactly when, I don’t ec -- but, at any rate, he was a blood relative and action was taken to try to contact him and see whether he could, in any way help out. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">His response was immediate and he said he could, of course try to help out but not monetarily because it was in the late 30’s and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was still reeling, as the States, I know must have been after the depression, and really no one had much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He -- Uncle Charlie, his name was Charlie Redlish, had established a small <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> where he treated alcoholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And it was very small and he ran it by himself with one nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But he apparently was successful enough, but I don’t think was getting paid exceedingly well because he and his wife and his married daughter and unmarried daughter, all -- an-and son and his wife all had to live together in one <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> just to be able to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">But he was instrumental in getting things going and very fortunately, his daughter Fay Redlish had a friend who was extremely well-to- do. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">He was in the manufacturing business of men’s suits, and at the time just before the war, was starting to get contracts for army uniforms, and apparently had an in politically speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And Jack took it upon himself, and I think I’m right in saying this, that he went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span> to see whether there was some way of expediting bringing us into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> had the law, of course, that only farmers June 23, 2005 and physicians could come in, and the other law, the law stated that they, if after a year’s time, the person could not make it on their own in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , they would be sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So it was a trial run, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">In addition to fulfilling that, the person also had to bring 3200 dollars with them, which at that point in time I guess must have been a fair amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And it took many months to actually get the permission to come, and once the permission was granted there was an awful lot to go through as far as the Canadian authorities were concerned, but as far as the German authorities were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Because they were on our tails constantly about signing this paper and that paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And during that period of time, many people were called to the <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> and never returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">This was a time in °36 - °37, when people were called on unbelievably small details to their leaving and to their lives, they were called, and they were made to jump off <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And this happened indeed, to friends of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Well, I think I can tell you, one day my father was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We were trembling, I think all day long, but he was one of the lucky ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">He signed whatever he needed to sign and pay whatever he needed to pay and he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">In the meantime we were granted permission and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was ordered to pack up our things. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I think it’s interesting to mention that we were allowed to bring things with us that had been -- that were old things. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So my grandmother suggested that we take her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> because that could be certified as being old. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I don’t know how -- I June 23, 2005- | know it was 10 years on suits because my father had to go to his tailor and tell him to put labels into his suits which indicated when they were made, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was -- as I say, was ordered and some of the old pieces were packed and- and put in, but nothing of their modern <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> could come with them, it -- it was only the old things, which -- which was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">But when we were packing -- and my father ha-had a terrific <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , and a wonderful stamp collection, and when the actual packing took place, the Nazi, with their guns came, and they stood over us as we were doing the packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I remember very, very well, we were in our little downstairs gardener’s apartment with lots and lots of boxes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , these two men with guns watching as my father packed all the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And whenever they liked a book -- an they particularly liked my children’s books, they just helped themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And they helped themselves to some of my father’s stamps too, and there wasn’t a thing we could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I remember my father putting his hand to his mouth and saying shh. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was just, that’s the way it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Well, he still came over with a lot of books and I did come over with some children’s books, but I think my best ones didn’t come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">That’s all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">But it was just, you know, the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Also, for example, it’s interesting; in that same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we were packing the books, we were also taking our food, because we were not allowed to eat with our grandmother upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We had to eat separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I mean, the June 23, 2005 little <span class="INT_SPACE">downstairs apartment</span> was like an independently organized <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They were allowed to bring the food down to us, but we couldn’t eat it together with them upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">All the boarders could eat upstairs and my grandmother could eat upstairs, but we couldn’t, and we had to eat downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  How would your family know this rule, this regulation that you couldn’t eat upstairs? </span><span class="sentence" id="706">How were you told?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  Oh, you know, that I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I don’t recall, but there would be -- day after day there would be leaflets left on th-the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> and people were checking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So, I assume it must have been through those leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Otherwise I -- I can’t imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But there were people always coming by and always checking up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  What about your going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to play with friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  I didn’t go out to play at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I rode my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> on the side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I remember having to actually change <span class="NPIP">places</span> on Victoriastrassen and -- into another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and that seemed to be safe enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I don’t remember having friends when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> at all, because I was hardly there long enough and people -- there wasn’t that nice easy going back and forth to <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> as there is in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it just wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And surely not at that point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I only had -- I only made two friends while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I wasn’t there that long, I guess, and the times were just not conducive. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  When you would see a Nazi officer in uniform, do you d -- do you remember any visceral effects it had on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  You know, I must say I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Again, I don’t remember, other than seeing them in groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And yes, I was scared, terribly scared because of what I remembered from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">But I -- either I was held away from being put into that situation or it perhaps just didn’t register. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> it was not a time to go to the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> , because we couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">It was not a time to go to a concert because we couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I think everything was in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">There wasn’t much of that either. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I think the times were so desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">My mother went to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But I have to add this, because this I think is very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">My parents both decided it was -- would be good if they took English lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And so they found out that there was a man, an Englishman who was settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , who was giving lessons to people who were leaving the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">My parents decided to also study English, as many of their friends were, a-and they went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of somebody who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and who was doing something other than giving English lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But he gave English lessons on the side, and he gave them in the evening, and my parents decided to take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And first they walked into his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he’s -- they were sitting at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , he with his back to a huge picture of Mr. Moseby. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And who is Mr. Moseby? </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He was the Nazi of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He was the June 23, 2005 emissary there. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Well, my mother and father said, we’ve got to learn English, we’ve got to face Moseby, and they went ahead and did and just disliked the occasion terribly but liked their teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Their teacher was a very good teacher and a very nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So they never could understand why Moseby was there, but he was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  So th-th -- you said they continued with their English lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  Yes, they took their English lessons and they did rather well and at least got a little bit of a foundation and developed their hearing skills and along with taking the- along with taking the ORT group, my father also learned how to concoct beauty preparations. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">He learned how to make cold creams and vanishing creams and moisturizing creams and all sorts of things practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And this stood us in very good stead, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And he bought jars, beautifully designed jars and labels for the jars, so -- in English -- so that they could be at -- affixed to the jars that perhaps might be of -- of use on immi -- on immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So that was a time when you asked what did people do, my parents were very busy, taking classes and doing very practical things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  Did you know they were preparing to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  I knew, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I knew that we were going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">When my mother -- when my father finally persuaded my mother that we had no alternative, she came around to it and of course I knew, because of the papers that needed signing and the June 23, 2005 documentation that needed to be gotten and the visits to ready ourselves, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And of course, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was being packed, I think it was very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It was very -- a very difficult time for my grandmother, because unfortunately we could not bring her with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The Canadian government put an age limit on those whom they would permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And of course, she was not a trained person, either a farmer or a physician, so she -- on her own she would not be able to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And she could not come as a member of the family, much to the everlasting sadness that my father went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He was an only child and he was very close to his mother, and I think he suffered terribly, just the fact that she had to stay behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  Her name was Hedwig, Frankel was her maiden name, Fischer. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ’s name was Garson Frankel, it was her father’s and that family’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">She was a good business lady, she was very interested in genealogy. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">In fact, I’ve just put together lots and lots of genealogic data, much of which she wrote down in German script. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And since there are not too many of us left who can still re-read German script, I thought I’d best do that, and I’ve done it and I am so glad because it has opened up all sorts of interesting new <span class="DLF">avenues</span> to investigate. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And unfortunately she- she was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And you know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , of course is a -- was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">killing camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So that was her demise. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I -- I [indecipherable] June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  How old was she when she died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  Well, we’re not really quite sure, but I know that I’m older than she was when she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">In fact, I think she must have been 60. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Probably something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I can look that up, I -- that I don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But she was the -- it -- it was so much fun visiting her when I was a little girl because she read stories to me and she introduced me to handwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">She did beautiful tatting and beautiful crocheting and I still have collars that she made me, which I have put into tissue paper, and have kept a tablecloth that she made for my mother, and just lovely handiwork.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  So your family was preparing to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Were you kind of thinking of what to take with you, cause you know you’d be leaving your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  I don’t think that I had any choice, because they could not buy things new for me, so I had to take what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And for themselves they couldn’t either, so we went with what we had, we couldn’t really prepare in that sense, at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  Nope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  So what was it like when you had to leave, for you emotionally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  Well, I remember taking leave from my grandmother -- my grandmother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we said goodbye to earlier on. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">When we moved to -- I think she came to visit us and we said goodbye then. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">My grandmother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , with whom we stayed, June 23, 2005 we said goodbye and -- and it was a very -- it was a very quiet time. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And I remember that one of the people who rented <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> from my grandmother was a pianist, and he played one of Chopin’s etudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And to this day, when I hear that etude, the tears come -- welled up in -- welled up in my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">This -- there was not much to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I think we all knew that this would be the last time and we were taking leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It was -- it was tough, very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I don’t remember how we got to where we went, I mean to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , but I know we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I don’t know how we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">We went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> we had to undergo medical checks with a Canadian doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And that was not a nice experience, but 1t was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">My mother, who very early in her life developed glaucoma, she was in her 40’s, she thinks that the doctor who examined her, Canadian doctor who examined her, might have had a suspicion that there was something there, but he didn’t let on. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">All she remembers is that she was forever getting her eyes examined. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Now, she was an undiagnosed glaucoma [indecipherable], so imagine if she had had the glaucoma 10 years before and they would have told her about it, she might never have gone blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Because she did eventually become blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">But yes, we passed our exams, our physicals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  Did they check you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  How did they do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">ANSWER:  All over. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">All over and then some, a little bit more than they really needed to, I think, but I passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And --
QUESTION:  Was your mother able to stay with you during the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But it was -- you know, I was a little girl, nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">It was not -- it wasn’t my doctor, the one that I was used to, and being patted all over by a strange person who was not -- whose language I didn’t understand, was not a happy situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  What month in 1938 was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Well, I figure it must have been June, or July. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">June or July. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">My mother’s brother came to see us off -- I mean, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to see us before we took our leave, and oh well, we were hoping that we would see each other again. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  But it was very iffy, because he hadn’t gotten permission to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and it was late 30’s -- mid-30’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  The anschluss had taken place in March of ’38, when Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Did you -- were you aware of that, or did your parents tell you about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Yes, they did, and they -- I could -- you know, interestingly enough, they didn’t have to tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">There was so much electricity 1n the <span class="DLF">air</span> , just our every day routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">June 23, 2005 And hearing particularly what was happening, through the maids, who went out and did their shopping and who went and -- to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">We always were aware of what people were thinking and what they were talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I think it came -- it came as a bit of a shock, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But then my father -- by that time my father had already made up his mind to go, and I think that reinforced his judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">It was just such a nerve-wracking time to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">One had to watch ones P’s and Q’s so carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Didn’t say anything in public, didn’t have an -- you know, even -- even when -- when you went for little walks, you’d look around and sort of make sure that nobody was hearing your conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">It was fraught with -- with all sorts of intangible, unpleasant things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Did you see any violence on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I wasn’t on the <span class="DLF">street</span> long enough, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I -- I was fairly well sheltered. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I don’t -- that I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">But I recall the dinner conversations when so and so was asked to come up to the Gestapo and so and so lost his business and such and such a person was asked for extra documentation, which of course they didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And it was -- it was just an unsure and uncertain and nerve-wracking time. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And I think my mother, who was a bit of an insomniac must have suffered terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">But you know, life continued and it’s amazing that it does, but it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And bi -- after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and having the medical exam and seeing our -- my Uncle Ludz, we were June 23, 2005 put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we left for -- for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> first, on our way to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I don’t remember the day that it was, but it must have been -- 1t was in the summer of 1938, and we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to Hoek van <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> , which was the <span class="DLF">port</span> , the <span class="DLF">seaport</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , before getting on the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">peanut boat</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And I remember we had second class tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">My father had gotten those and we were to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were entering the second class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> when somebody came waving a paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Dr. Fischer, Dr. Fischer, would you kindly move over into the first class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="843">My father said he had second class tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Yes, but 1t would -- it would be better if we went into the first class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I remember it so vividly, but the second class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> had red leather <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> , and first class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> had green velvet <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I was dressed -- what is it, to the sevens? </span><span class="sentence" id="847">To the fours?</span></p>

ANSWER:  I had a lovely doll, a Katie [indecipherable] doll and something happened to her between the -- in the last 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I cannot locate her and I am desolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Yes, mine [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I certainly brought a doll with me and I don’t think I brought too much else in way of toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">That was -- not even a Teddy bear, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Just a doll.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="896">ANSWER:  I brought some fairy tales and a few stories about animals and I still have them and look at them every now and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">There was one lovely one about an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aquarium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">But I loved fairy tales. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">My mother always used to say [speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I am too much involved in play. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I was always imagining, playing imaginary games of -- I June 23, 2005 think my joy 1n life was to be a princess, to have a crown on my head and to eat noodle soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I -- I don’t -- I can’t think of other toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I did bring card games. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Some games and some puzzles. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And I have the card games, they were quartets and they were quartets dealing with authors and with flowers and with comics. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Very funny comics from the newspaper, but they were in sets of fours. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And also cards with letters so that one could make Scrabble words, but all as cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Small, small things. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">But I think that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Maybe a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chessboard</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  And -- all right, you’ve now recuperated from your appendix operation? </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  I recuperated, and my father of course, had to scout around to find a new -- a voyage for us across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and it was close to September and the visitors were returning back to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> after vacationing in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">It was a particularly busy time of the year because the teachers were coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on their trips and it was -- it was a bit of a -- of -- of a difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">However, the <span class="BUILDING">Canadian embassy</span> could not have been nicer. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">They found my folks a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay because staying at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was too expensive, and they settled them in somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Golders Green</span> , which is a f -- well-known Jewish community, and perhaps not so far away from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And they arranged, through the Jewi -- with the help of the Jewish Aid Society in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to get us a later <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> over and we came over on the Montrose, June 23, 2005 which was a slightly smaller <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> than we were supposed to come on, but they had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the three of us and we had a good voyage across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">At least my mother had a good voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">My father and I took it downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">We were -- he and I were quite seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Not that it was such a hazardous journey at -- according to the information that I got from <span class="BUILDING">pier 21</span> , it was a rather smooth journey, but our stomachs did not know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">My mother played ping pong onboard and we were downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">QUESTION:  Were there many refugees on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bor</span> -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">ANSWER:  No, there were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">There were -- I don’t think there were -- I -- as far as I know there were none, and I have the -- I have the entire list of the people in our class, tourist class, and we did not see Jewish names at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Most of them, as I say, were returning visitors to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Did not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">We did have iceberg practice and we all got into our assigned jackets and had to parade out. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And we were very close to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">iceberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I think it’s as close as I'd like to get to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">iceberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">But it was a drill, and of course everybody took part. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">There was a very nice party, I’m told, at the end of the ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I don’t think my parents were in -- in a partying mood, but there was a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And I should mention to you that the last day, the day that we were supposed to -- that we did in fact land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , I woke up and could not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I had total paralysis of both my legs and my father had to carry me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">This happened twice in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">This was the first time, and the second time it happened when, as a June 23, 2005 student in 1948, I had the -- and I was on an international student service seminar, I had the opportunity to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the same thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I woke up paralyzed from my waist down. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The paralysis did not last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">My father carried me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">The relatives were there to meet us. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And in a day the paralysis was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I think they call this a hysterical paralysis, which it undoubtedly was. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Terribly frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  What were you frightened of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  This new life in a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where we didn’t know the language, where we didn’t know anybody really, not even our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I think just terrible fright. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">But you know, it happened that time, the first time and we ascribed it to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But it was interesting that it should happen -- what was it, 10 years later? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Again, and th-the return visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And I’ve never been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">QUESTION:  Did you know any English at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">ANSWER:  I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And I learned it very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But for the first couple of months I was very silent, but after that I could grapple with it quite nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I sat. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">My schoolteacher did not allow me to have a dictionary in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">She wanted me to absorb it totally by ear, which I guess perhaps was the right thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I was horrified that I couldn’t have my dictionary, but she didn’t allow it, and I learned it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  So you settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and met Uncle Charlie and Aunt Bertha, the people who sent the telegram, and their children and it was decided that all of us, Uncle Char- Charlie, and his wife and the daughter, married Wilfred and their son, and my mother and father and I would all take a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And we did, and we all lived together for a number of years in one <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , where --
QUESTION:  When you mentioned telegram what were you referring to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  Well, I think the telegram was sort of the lynchpin, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">This was a telegram that arrived at the wedding, for the wedding of my grandparents, sent by a distant relative in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> by the name of Charlie -- Charles Redlish. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">It was a telegram that was sent to send congratulations to the wedding of and the mishpoka of the grandparent, my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And my grandmother kept that telegram, as she kept many, many things, and remembered in the 30’s that there was somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> who was distantly related. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And this telegram really started the correspondence between my parents and that distant relative that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And I have many copies of this telegram because I feel it was the thing that saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">The one item that established a relationship with family abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  When you started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , were you placed in your chronological grade, or a younger grade? </span><span class="sentence" id="972">June 23, 2005
ANSWER:  No, actually I started in grade four and was in my -- with my own peer group, so that I had to learn English, but I think I could do most everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Math I certainly could do, and I learned English soon enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">By the end of the year I won the prize for the best student. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So I didn’t do too badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I worked hard at my studies because I had so much to catch up on. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">My distant relative played all kinds of tricks on me and made me say horrible things because I didn't know what I was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And I got into a lot of trouble, but it sorted itself out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">QUESTION:  Did you miss <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Did you consider <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  I missed my friends, I missed my grandmothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I don’t know that I missed the physical part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I think at that age perhaps that’s not so important, but I certainly missed my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">It was so much -- there was so much to learn and so much new, and so much to catch up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">It -- the impressions came so hard and so fast and they were so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Coming from -- coming from a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for example, as we were lucky enough to have, with servants and whatnot to a one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we stayed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">We had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and that -- that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It was a -- a new lifestyle, but you know, my -- my mother particularly was quite adventuresome. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">My father became very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">My father, who was unable to find work because they wouldn’t let him work, was in a -- sort of a desperate situation and as the war years came along, it became even more so. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Because remember, in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , the war started June 23, 2005 September the third, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">We were at war exactly a year from the date we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My father tried to join the army, they wouldn’t have him because he wasn’t a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">He wanted to join the medical corps, they wouldn’t have him because he wasn’t registered as a medic in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and you couldn’t become a medic in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> until you took up citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And so all -- everything was closed, and his main concern was trying to get the grandmothers over. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And he had absolutely no luck in that department. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I know he traveled back and forth to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span> trying to persuade the powers that be, the natio -- the commissioner of refugees, a wonderful woman by the name of Senator Karen Wilson, to see if there was some way of getting the grandparents out, even if it would be over at the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republics</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , but even that <span class="DLF">door</span> seemed to be closed because of their ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And my father was making creams at that point and my mother, fortunately got a job and worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">She fortunately met a physician through friends, I guess, or family, Canadian family, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , who was very interested in the fact that she was able to do physiotherapy, which was not done a whole lot on this side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And she was very well trained and it was a period of the polio epidemic starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And also, she did post-operative -- broken legs and things like that, she worked with patients and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And she really had a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">She -- she e -- well, in time she even -- we even got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that had a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in it, a June 23, 2005 finished basement in which she gave classes, gym classes, and then the rest of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was rented out to different people -- different <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And she -- she did very well and -- because my father couldn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But he was invited by Dr. Wilder Pennfield and Dr. Cohen at the <span class="BUILDING">Neurological Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , which 1s a very well known <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to come on rounds and to hone his skills and to get the English lingo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And he did that, and in time he met someone who asked him to become an intern in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the Maritime provinces of <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , where the medical people left in order to join the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So a <span class="NPIP">place</span> became available where they really needed his skills, and he -- he worked there until -- until someone said, why do you have this enemy alien working for the Ca-Canadian government? </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And he went through a horrible period of time in which his life was made miserable by the powers that be because he was -- they considered him as an enemy alien who -- whom they suspected of being a farmer and a spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He -- the Mounties came to visit him one day and he said, take the cameras, because they were afraid that he was photographing installations on the shore -- 0-0 -- the seacoast of <span class="REGION">New Brunswick</span> , which was where his job was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He went to <span class="REGION">New Brunswick</span> to take on the job, my mother and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> so that she could continue working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And as an intern, you know, it’s hardly enough to support a family, so they -- we lived in separate <span class="NPIP">places</span> for awhile, for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But he even weathered that, and I came across some of the June 23, 2005 clippings in the newspaper in getting ready to talk to you just the other day and I didn’t realize the splash that all this made in the newspapers across <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , that, you know, the government was employing enemy aliens to -- who were taking advantage and taking the money from our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So you come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you come to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> -- and of course, I was called a dirty Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>

time in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">It was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">QUESTION:  So how did you handle this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and hearing this in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  With great difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">With very, very great difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">But I did have Jewish friends in class, and I must say, I found -- I found my friends among Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">All- practically only Jewish children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And we did not live in a Jewish section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> at all.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, that’s a very interesting question, because yes, they tried to have and they have letters to their mothers until the war broke out, which was only a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And after that, there was no more correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">But when my father knew that somebody was going -- traveling from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> to the <span class="REGION">Maritime provinces</span> , or from the <span class="REGION">Maritime provinces</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , depending on where he was, he would always ask them would they mail a letter in the one stop that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> made in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And so yes, they got mail over to them, a-at least to let them know that things were going well for us, even though the only -- they could only write to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and then States would send us the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So that -- that was very di -- that was traumatic.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">ANSWER:  My world was totally consumed with the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">My father used to keep a map on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and punch pins into where the Germans were, and especially once the war June 23, 2005 started, how the movements of the Germans were taking place, how the forces were progressing, both into the <span class="REGION">east zone</span> towards <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , as well as out to -- through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And we would listen to news every night, of course, and as many times during the day as, you know, as there were news on, which wasn’t always our time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I mean, the news came on at seven o’clock and everybody was sitting around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And I think it was the most trying of times because my father was trying to tell people in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> what was happening and nobody listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">My father brought out clippings from newspapers, German newspapers that he hid in slatted areas of his suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">He hid them in the linings of the suitcases, to show the powers that be on this side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> what was happening because nobody was listening and nobody wanted to believe what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Fortunately, he did not get caught, because when he was called one time to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> -- and he was called many times -- he was very afraid that they might have found something because he was clipping, he was clipping newspaper articles right and left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">QUESTION:  Clipping from which papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">ANSWER:  Newspa -- the German newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">He was taking sections out of newspapers to bring here to this side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">ANSWER:  Oh, oh absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Not -- well, they saw the beginnings of it all when people disappeared and people just didn’t make it back from the <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> or they were snatched out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I mean, that was happening all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And it was 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Things were not at all tranquil, even -- even in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I think there was much fear, there was much fear and there was the constant hope that we could bring the mothers out.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">QUESTION:  And her name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">June 23, 2005
ANSWER:  Her name was Unni Haushner -- Unni Rosenber -- Rosenbaum Haushner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">She had two children, my mother and Uncle Ludz and Ludz was the younger of the two and he was smuggled out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by his non-Jewish girlfriend and made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in °39, the war had already started, and made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and signed up almost immediately for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And what I’m trying to find out at this point in time 1s whether he might have been one of the Ritchie boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">The Ritchie boys, the German Jewish people who came over who became interpreters and who were sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the army to help with language things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Because he did indeed go into the army and became an interpreter and stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war had finished to help with the -- with translations for the Nuremberg Trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">But I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I’m trying to find out whether he might have been a Ritchie boy because there’s been some interesting information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Ritchie boys, the camp that was started here in <span class="COUNTRY">Maryland</span> that trained linguists -- he might have been, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I --
QUESTION:  How did he get into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> now, and you all couldn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  Well, that’s very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">He established -- well, I -- I think that he was able to come through an uncle on my mother’s side who declared him as being very well versed in the canning industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I think that may have been it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">He worked for my grandfather, I mean how -- he -- and he was trained in the chemical aspects of this canning business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">June 23, 2005 End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">This is tape number three, side B. You were already in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> when Kristallnacht happened in November °38. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">How did you hear about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">ANSWER:  Well, I think we probably learned about it through the radio, a-and of course knew at once that if <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were the targets, ours, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratibor</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> were undoubtedly part of the picture, and indeed they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I don’t know that we knew the particulars, but I do know that my father said, and they didn’t burn part of that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because there were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> around the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that were in hands of Germans, close to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> around or near the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was destroyed, and part of 1t was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which 1s the one that my parents and grandparent went 1n -- we-were in -- were members of and where my grandparents had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pews</span> , strangely enough next to each other, we know that that -- we knew that that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was badly damaged in part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And the pictures have borne that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">They’re in the process of restoring that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> at this point in time, but what I learned -- what we learned, and of course to the horror of everyone, oh we -- we learned through the radio and then also I June 23, 2005 believe there must have been notification by mail as to what -- what was damaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Interestingly enough, I think that my father and his mother probably had sort of an understanding of what was going to be said in a -- in a code sort of way, as to the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  This was a code between the two of them so you wouldn’t understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">ANSWER:  No, so that -- so -- all the letters were censored at that point and they did not want the censors to be aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I know that certain people’s names were mentioned, and never with a surname, and maybe with Uncle John did such and such, and you kind of knew what was going on and I do remember the last letter that my grandmother wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">She wrote that she needed some tea, would we be able to send her some tea, and that was the last -- that was the last letter that we ever received from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And in all the letters, 1t was a little bit upbeat, in I am very well, but -- or -- or Iam very well, and then period, and then could you possibly send me some tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And we knew that that was a very bad sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">About Kristallnacht itself, other than hearing it, and of course my parents just speechless with the news that was coming in, I still see us sitting around the radio, the whole family and really despairing.</span></p>

ANSWER:  My mother always said -- she said -- of herself, she said, I had a childhood, you never had a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And I think it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I don’t think I ever did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And what can I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I didn’t have a childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Any other experiences you can remember about during the wartime while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I mean, you said your father followed the progress of the war with the pins.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">ANSWER:  Well, in our <span class="BUILDING">Canadian schools</span> , a lot of English guest children came over and so we had many guest children in our classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">People who opted to send their kids overseas until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And I had a very, very dear friend, Monya Williams was her name and we stayed in touch for awhile after she went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And life in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , as life was here was -- had rationing, we had a lot of rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I think you probably had more rationing than we did, but it was as my mother always used to say, this isn’t rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">She went through the first World War, and she said this was just equalizing things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">It was, you know, very, very little rationing per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Nobody ever went hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And during the war -- a-as a child during the war I rolled bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I went down to <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross headquarters</span> on Saturdays and I helped served coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">My mother also w-worked for the Red Cross at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">blood donating centers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I work -- I -- I helped when we had service personnel come to the Jewish u -- like a USO. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">We went and we washed dishes and we served sandwiches June 23, 2005 to the young soldiers who were coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And this was a little bit later on, this was when the soldiers were coming through the <span class="REGION">Maritime provinces</span> to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to send them overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">The Jewish lads had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to come to to dance and to write letters and just to have a good time, and we teenagers were allowed to help and that was always -- that was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I had a job very early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I tried to get a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> painting signs, but they thought maybe 11 was too young to get a jo- to give anybody a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">But I used to sometimes walk to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> -- to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I did go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , we went to <span class="BUILDING">Shaar Hashomayim</span> , which is a very beautiful, large <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and I had Hebrew twice a week and I had <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , but most of the time I either walked, or more than likely I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , 1f I wasn’t lucky enough to get a ride in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bronsman car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Now, the Bronsman kids, Charlie and Edgar were classmates of mine at Shaar Hashomayim, and they had a -- a driver who drove them back and forth from <span class="BUILDING">class</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , and once in awhile we got rides with them, and that was very nice because they had chocolate milk on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and the rest of us usually just got white milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And my mother, as a matter of fact, in her -- in her physiotherapy capacity massaged -- gave massages to Mrs. Bronsman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And I remember very well in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> my mother did the Bronsman job, I guess once a week and she would have to walk, because of course she didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> June 23, 2005 would only carry her so far, and she would have to walk up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westmount</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Now mind you, the Bronsmans lived up on the very top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and there certainly wasn’t a- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> going up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And so she marched in the cold of winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> can be very icy in wintertime and she got such chilblains, and I remember she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , her legs were just so cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I remember weeping and thinking how she was suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And I asked her about it a number of years back and I said, Mother, I used to cry so, because I was so unhappy that you had such hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And she said oh, she said, you know, I look back on this and she said it was such a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">It was the only time in my life, when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , where I was an independent woman and where I carried the family on my shoulders, and she said that was very satisfying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I go -- I -- I’ve mulled that over many, many times, and indeed it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">She did wonderful work in -- in her capacity as therapist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">QUESTION:  So, did you experience any anti-Semitism during the war years in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Oh, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">ANSWER:  -- I would say those were really very few times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">QUESTION:  Ho-How would you respond when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">ANSWER:  I think I just walked away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I don’t think that I could respond to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I would June 23, 2005 think I could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I still recall exactly where these encounters took place, and they were not in sight of the teachers, they were when we were having recess, either playing marbles, or downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">On very cold days we were -- we were just mulling around and sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and so on for -- for a little time out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And it wasn’t the boys as much as the girls that were nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">But maybe girls are nastier to each other anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">QUESTION:  Did you tell your parents about these incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">ANSWER:  Probably not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Probably not, I think -- I think I just did not want them to worry about things more than they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">They had -- they had so many worries on their shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">My father, who couldn’t work and who wanted so much to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And y -- no -- you know, no money coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">My mother, who worked so hard, and nothing in the offing for my father and that must have been, to the kind of person that he was, a tremendous blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And -- however, he had a fantastic sense of humor all -- all his life, and I think maybe it even helped him then when things looked so bleak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And I think the frustration that he carried within him, having so much information, wanting to tell people -- he even was in touch with a writer from the newspaper who was the son of somebody who knew somebody, you know, closer, and not just the man on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And nobody wanting to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I think that must have been so frustrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">June 23, 2005
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Did you feel German at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Canadian, Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">How would you describe yourself during the war years in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t feel Canadian, certainly not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Everything was very strange to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I didn’t feel German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I guess I felt Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And maybe not by choice, but I was made to feel Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Not that, you know, not that I wouldn’t say I was Jewish, but I think yes, I think I was made to feel Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I remember a sad thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I was walking in front of a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> one day, looking at some baked goods in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery store</span> , Id -- would feast my eyes on all these good, good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And there was my father, I didn’t realize that he was in back of me, looking at me -- so he tells me, and I’m sure it’s true -- with not enough change in his pocket to buy me the little roll that I wanted, that I would have liked to have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It -- I think, you know, these are such small things in the scheme of things, but such humiliating and -- and depressing reactions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I mean, I think of it often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I’m sure he never thought of it that much any more after the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He was a realist, 1t couldn’t happen at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I, on the other hand, internalized the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And -- yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">QUESTION:  And so you made -- you continued to make friends though, when -- y-you were talking about during those times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">ANSWER:  Yes, I had -- I made friends, I had no trouble making friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Made good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And then, of course, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> only fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh -- four years June 23, 2005 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint John</span> , <span class="REGION">New Brunswick</span> , where my father got the job as an intern, but we were not able to join him until the four years were over and h-he was able to get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and get enough money to support us, because my mother did not work after we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint John</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1220">QUESTION:  And then how long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1221">ANSWER:  And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint John</span> -- well, I was married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint John</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So I think my parents moved in 1955. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">My father got his citizenship in 1945 or ’46, and then took his Dominion Council exams and passed his exams so that he could go into practice, which he did, and then he be -- he became a diabetic and had some physical problems and so it was thought that he should give up private practice and go into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> situation, which he did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> , <span class="REGION">Nova Scotia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric hospital</span> there, and he was in charge of all the woman patients, I think, at that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And he stayed there until he retired and he was -- that was ’78, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">So he was there quite a number of years and they made a very happy life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1227"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint John</span> was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , little in-bred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I mean, it was very small in every way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> was really a nice thing for them to do because first of all it was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and then it had the stimulation of having a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Two, as a matter -- three -- three <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , with a lot of cultural things going in, which they loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And they got a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the Dartmouth side of the -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> June 23, 2005 and then they joined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">When my father -- when my father retired, he wanted to move Mom and himself down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> , which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">They came and they joined us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> and were there a couple of years when my husband was called by the NIH to come and work here and to head the department of blood diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And so my parents said, well we’d like to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">With heavy heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">They -- they did not want to come to the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">So they moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> and had many more good years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> until my father died and then my mother did indeed come to visit -- I mean, come to stay with us, and that was good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">QUESTION:  Let’s go back a little bit in time, to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">What was it like for you when the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  Oh, it was the most freeing, wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I remember being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and my father sending me information about the victory, and all <span class="NPIP">hell</span> broke loose in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">This was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Canadian camp</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And it was such a freeing -- it was like tearing away ropes that bound one’s chest, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And of course, with it came the realization that even though the war was over, there were so many gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I remember, for example, in the middle of one night when my mother woke us all up screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And this was in the 40’s, the early 40’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And to this day she thinks that was the day that her mother was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And -- and probably it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Probably it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">June 23, 2005 But the fact that the war was over was -- at least the European part of the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">This was not yet the end because -- but Canadian forces were not in the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">So in a way, for us that war was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">QUESTION:  During the war, during the latter parts of the war, did your family know anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or did that come out only later for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">ANSWER:  You know, I had the feeling that they did know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because there were some camps that were already in existence when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> for one, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So, I think they were very well aware of what was going on, and I don’t know, but they kept in very close touch with friends who had also emigrated, and when one got, you know, word about anything, that they would share with the adults, not the -- not the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And as I say, for many years my father tried so desperately to get the grandmothers out, and would go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in order to do some of his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I mean, up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span> , down here to this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">But there was -- there was no way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1260">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">So the war is over, did the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> celebrate at all, or did you celebrate in any specific way? </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1263">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">No, I don’t think there was a celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I can’t -- I can’t -- I can’t -- I don’t know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">ANSWER:  Well, Pll tell you a wonderful thing that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">After all -- after the war was over, my parents wanted to adopt a child from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And indeed they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Our darling Saul came to us -- my father had wanted to have a son, a boy come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">He didn’t have a boy of his own, I think, and he probably thought it was best not to have another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">So arrangements were made through the Canadian -- mm, I can’t think of the organization, but it was a refugee organization, and in time Saul arrived with a number of other children who were brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , for whom <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were found, and he came to live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And he came, I was away in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> already and when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , here was this new addition to the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Well, as it turned out, he was with us for awhile, and when he gain -- when he realized the kind of person Mom and Dad were, he said, you know, I really have a mother, but I was afraid -- a -- a blood mother who survived -- and -- but I want -- I needed to get -- I wanted to get out and the only way to get out was to declare myself as an orphan, which 1s how he got into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and --

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">Tell me a little bit about your artwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">What media do you work in, and what subjects? </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">You had mentioned the Holocaust before, and so if you could expand on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1557">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I was a frustrated art student when I was studying microbiology and really all my life wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Wasn’t allowed to because of other June 23, 2005 matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">However, finally, after my children stayed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> til 3:30 in the afternoon, my husband urged me to do what I’ve always wanted to do and that was to go to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> , which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Tennessee</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And first I -- he had had a -- a second heart attack at that point in our story and I again thought well, I should go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn to do something that would prepare me to earn a living, God forbid, and thought I would study art education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">However, after the second class of art education I decided that was not for me under any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">Perhaps I should try the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">And he wanted very much to have me do that and so I did go to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> and I studied metalworking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">And I -- I learned how to s -- do metalsmithing, metalcasting and all aspects of the metal as an a -- as a tool, and taking a Master’s degree in Fine Arts at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">And worked in metals and also had to choose a second part and that was fibers, and so I took metals and fibers both, and then interesting situation arrived in the sense that after two years I was told -- and I was working part time because I still had the carpools and the kids and 18 puppies and all that sort of thing -- I was told I had to choose a thesis project. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And so I decided I would write a thesis on the history of the ceremonial objects pertaining to the Torah and make contemporary pieces based on the research of the history of each of these as implements on their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">So I made breastplates and I made [indecipherable] 105 June 23, 2005 pointers, and I proposed the [indecipherable] and I made the covering for the Torahs and I made mezuzahs and all sorts of other things along the side, learning the technique. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">But I wanted to do something that was a bit cerebral as well as doing - creating something new, and so that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">And I wrote a thesis, a thick book, which- the work of which I enjoyed tremendously, both doing the library re-research, which was a little difficult from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> , <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> got me all kinds of books that I needed to and I was able to do that and in my graduate show I showed my pieces, and it was accepted and I was a happy camper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">I graduated in 1973 with all my dear ones around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">Cap and gown and the whole thing, and David graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">So we had a gala celebration together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And then we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> and I had -- I had the use of the <span class="BUILDING">university lab</span> to do my work in and then we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> and I no longer had a <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> to work in and so I decided perhaps it was time to switch from doing metalwork, which required gas, which I find very hard to -- to keep in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which psychologically was very difficult for me to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tank</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1576">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Because of -- because of memories or thoughts about gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">I decided I would go ahead and carry on with weaving, which I loved, and I did tapestry weaving on -- I have a loom and I used the loom for various tapestry projects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">But all along I still June 23, 2005 loved my metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">And so, in the I-last number of years I’ve combined the two and I weave metal on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And it’s wire that I use, and I use stainless steel wire and copper wire and brass wire and I weave it on my loom and I do sculptural pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">Many of them are Judaic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">I take really my inspiration from the jew -- things Judaic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">And of course, I have concentrated both on the liturgy -- I’ve done a series on the High Holy Day prayers, but I’ve also done Holocaust series and I did one particular six piece Holocaust -- progression of thoughts on the Holocaust from the earliest days to the final days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">And so -- and also my metal, my woven metal -- metal pieces are [indecipherable] boxes and things that could -- that could be used 1n worship or in home worship at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">I made mis -- mizrahs and the -- various other implements where I can use the wos -- woven fi -- the woven fabric made out of metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">And the combination of the technique of the loom plus the material of the metalsmith has given me a great deal of satisfaction, and I still continue working, very much influenced by my Judaic background, and very happy doing what I’m doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1587">QUESTION:  Can you describe your -- your six panel work that you did relating to the Holocaust in a little more detail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1588">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">I called it “Never Again” and it is really a -- a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">It’s made up of six individual pieces and you’ll see a lot of symbolism in this, o-of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">It -- it’s a progression of the events that occurred from the beginnings, relating increasingly to June 23, 2005 the restrictive things, of the ims -- restrictive laws of the Nazi regime in the 30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">The second panel details Kristallnacht using my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as a -- part of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as my emphasis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">The third is badges, reminding us of the oppressive acts of the Nazis when they tried to cleanse the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of undesirables. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">Incarceration, a progression for the confinement, enclosure and last journeys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">The rapid escalation to- to convey to and remove prisoners from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">I think one of the ideas that I used o-on the side, there’s a progression from one to six, I used the stripes of the tallid, progressing from one to six. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">I chose six because of the reference to six million. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">My last piece is a very dark one, but it has a little glimmer of gold, and that is our hope for the future, that these things never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">They’re small tapestries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">I wanted them small so that one has to lean into them in order to really study them, more like putting one’s nose into a book, if you will, by coming thr -- into very close contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">I used cotton material because it was a non-precious material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">I felt that I wanted to use something rather universal and simple and there are -- there are many references to numbers and to colors and to the stripes on the prisoners garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">And the colors of the -- the badges, which represented different factions, not only Jews, but people in general who were incarcerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">It’s a series that I did not start with piece number one, strangely enough, piece number five was the first one I did, and then kind of wove. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">I knew I wanted to do six pieces, but June 23, 2005 started with number five and then went backwards and started to number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">The first one has a few let -- letters in it, and it says Jude Raus, but if you’ll see the d-e and the u-s is Deus, and my question is where was Deus, where was God then? </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">It was a mammoth undertaking psychologically for me to do this piece, but I hope that the children will look on it sometime and remember what happened to all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1608">QUESTION:  Have you been to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , or any other <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> ?</span></p>
