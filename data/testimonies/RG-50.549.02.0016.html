<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Let me make sure I’m getting all this on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I want to begin with talking about the events, maybe the weeks or days leading up to the end of the war and where you were and what you were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Well, the end of the -- the days of the end of the war, after I had lived through the liberation in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated on the 25th of August, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And then the war ended in *45. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and originally I had papers to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that there was Pearl Harbor and the Americans [indecipherable] entered the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So, the papers that I had then, which was the affidavit of support, which we got from our relatives here, that expired. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And of course after that, I went through all my adventures to deportation and the escape and the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But in *45, at the end of the war, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and was awaiting the documents that my aunt, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> sent me, which is an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, I received my visa of entry into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And in January of 1947, the 19th of January 1947, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LeHavre</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and took the John Erikkson to the <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> , a 10 days crossing. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on the 29th of January, 1947, which is now a little over 51 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">To some people, a lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and it’s hardly to be believed, that’s 51 years have gone by, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at the end of the -- of -- of the war and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">At that point, I didn’t know yet what had happened to my family, although the -- the indications were quite ominous that a tragedy had happened, because we knew already what had happened on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I knew that my mother -- hadn’t heard since ‘42. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So that was, to me, an indication. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So I came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I -- I was then s-still ignorant of the fact what happened to my mother and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where they were -- German soldiers were being led through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s in the book, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That is in my book, the book will come out at the end of this year -- towards the end of the year now. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Probably November of 1998 and the book will be called, “Leap into Darkness - Seven Years on the Run in <span class="REGION">Wartime Europe</span> ”’. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It’s co-written by my good friend Michael Oleska, the -- actually, he was the -- he motivated me to write it and then he was editing it f-for me and we did mutual project, was -- it went very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Taught me a lot and gave me an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But, at the end of the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> , I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That’s where I was when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> , the German oc -- the German garrison in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> was not the same as it had been before June of 1944, because some of them were sent to the <span class="REGION">war front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> took place on the sixth of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And on the 10th of June was the burning of the village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orodure</span> , to which I was a -- almost witness, because I was on my way there and got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when I saw a German transport going there and I didn’t want to go into the same direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and all it’s inhabitants, except a few, burned with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I was just about maybe 10 - 15 miles away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Everyone that had a ticket for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orodure</span> , to get off, which I had -- was taken into <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , was part of that massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So there again, I was lucky in a great, great way. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">You see, my escape is not so much survival and -- and that’s why I say I don’t exult in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It’s a -- it’s a question of -- of fear and luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The fear is the motivater and then you got to be lucky for -- for it to succeed or to -- to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So, that was just -- before the liberation, after the liberation, we had these -- the remnant of the German garrison in -- in- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They were taken down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , down towards the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> by a ragtag outfit of the resistance, whom the Germans considered dispensable, just a few weeks earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And here, this ragtag outfit that didn’t have matching shoes, had the nerve. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically, except their pride and their joy that the -- now, the war -- the end of the war came. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Those Germans acted like little sheep, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Their -- a few weeks earlier they were the masters and at that moment they walked with their hands on top of their heads and looking scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Because they’re human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And some of them were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I mean they were in the hands of these underground people and they knew that these undergrounds had a bone to pick with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They knew that wh-wh-wh-when we are in their hands, we are not in the hands of - of a -- of -- of an enemy’s ha -- high command, where they have to deal with -- with protocol and war amenities. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The amenities of exchanging and of fairness, imprisonment. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">These -- these underground, th-the -- the resistance, they were bent on -- on vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  And you are -- were a member of this ragtag [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I -- I was -- I was not -- I -- I was a member of the -- of the Sixth. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The -- the Sixth was a group that was engaged in clandestine performances, like doing false identification cards and -- and documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We did that already, before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But, we were all under a -- taking orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Some were connected with the FTPF, they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In French it’s Front Tereur Partisain Francais. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Front tereur means snipers or guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Partisain -- partisans, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They were a tough -- oh, how do you say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Rough, rock and tumble outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They didn’t go by -- by orders or by command. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was another group was called FFI, the Force Francais L’Interiore. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The French Forces of the Interior. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They took orders from DeGaulle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And there was this conflict between the two groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The one wanted to go the -- the legal -- the -- the proper way. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The other said, “We're going to get the enemy whichever way we can.” </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So this -- this was the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And under -- we were usually under these orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But the partisans that arrested the Germans, they were the ones that had come out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> carrying their rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Some of the rifles -- most of the rifles were not loaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But the rifle looked good and inspired -- if -- if -- if not fear, at least respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were feeling that particular day, after -- after so many years on the run and so much uncertainty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Well, it -- it -- it -- it was -- there was elation. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There was jubil -- jubilant attitudes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">In the <span class="DLF">streets</span> 1t was festive, carnival-type. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And people were rejoicing that -- that -- to see that the Germans had been defeated because the atrocities -- in fact, I write that in the book, down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , th-they were -- they were carrying placards, “Remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orodure</span> ’’, that’s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that they burned down, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Euphoria, that’s the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Wh --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The mood was euphoric. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And then with it came a sobering moment, mixed in with that euphoria. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That while the war is finished, there are families somewhere from whom we hadn’t heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, to us this was the beginning of a new chapter of finding out and searching. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And being here dealing with things. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated, in ‘44 - in August °44, we knew that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was not defeated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In fact, that same year, in the -- in the fall, came the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And in that counter attack by the Germans, they advanced far enough for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to feel that there might be another -- a re-occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">That never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The allies -- allies prevailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But that was that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Germans were still kicking -- alive and kicking. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And when the landing took place in ‘44, during that period, in June of ‘44, the deportations from <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So even that euphoric moo-mood, about the landings, had to be tempered with -- with the knowledge that people are still being sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But then when -- when -- in 1945, in May of ‘45, the armistice was signed, there was a different attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Now, we knew that the war was ended and we had to deal with the aftermath. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">For many of us, that had to do with family, because we had left our families and loved ones and some of it -- some of them left with their families, but in the process of fleeing, of going to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and living on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vichy</span> , some of those fa-families had been separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Young men were hiding out while their parents were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">That happened quite often, you saw that in the movies with -- with “Au revoir mes enfants” and you had so many other things and -- and so in Freedman in the wrote -- the wro -- who wrote that book, “When Memory Comes”, he was taken to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and his parents were deported and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And finally he got back to his Judaism, because he -- he was converted by the padres and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a -- not to a con -- he went to a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So anyway, we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good, but there was the family’s story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it was the great uncertainty, who had survived and who had not survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  And how did you go about beginning to deal with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  I tried to start searches. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Red Cross and other <span class="NPIP">venues</span> and did actually not find out until 1962 what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That was from ‘47 to ‘62, 15 years -- what happened to my mother and sisters, which is also in -- in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And how I dealt at the moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I had received my papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108"><span class="COUNTRY">Countries</span> are always beautiful, 1t’s what the people do that’s not so good, often, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to me was -- was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that I wanted already to get away from because I had been in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I had been deported and I had been beaten up and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I -- I looked forward to coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , wh-where I knew I had family and start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And that’s what I was dealing with. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in Europe and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to Red Cross and other agencies and I never heard anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn’t advance anything from me emotionally, because I’d only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I looked forward to make a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality. [</span><span class="sentence" id="119">indecipherable] stay here and -- and -- and -- and - and f -- and fight it to the end, because the continent was no longer for me, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I wanted to get away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  How did you support yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You were a young man and for those two years before you came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Well, we were all -- the American Joint Distribution Committee, they were in charge, even during the war, with some of the aid that they distributed to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> I worked for a aid committee, the Corshazod committee -- com-com-Committee d’ Assistance Sociale est Secouron a Reconstructione. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">A -- a reconstruction of every -- we helped people who came back, who were repatriated or people who came out of hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And to -- to establish themselves with -- with ID cards and rejoining families. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I worked for that committee and -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> and that committee was also in charge of distributing the Joint Distribution -- the American Joint Distri -- A -- the -- AJDC -- the JDC, American Joint Distribution Committee -- Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They sent funds into Europe and they were the arm that extended into the -- into the Jewish community of friends and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in the -- in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your --
ANSWER:  And by the way, on that committee, I got paid for working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Nominally, but I didn’t need to go to fancy <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , you know or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Tell me about your -- your trip to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  I was in a -- on the Jo -- SS John Erikkson. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I was -- I think about a 37 -- 37,000 ton former liberty ship. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And it was a -- a January voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">80 percent of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> got seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Most of us, while we were seasick, slept on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , because in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabins</span> it was too -- the smell wasn’t so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There was -- with the disinfectant and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I -- it was a -- a-- a pleasant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to be on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It had good food and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> where one F-Frenchman was playing swing music. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It’s interesting -- was an interesting voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We were seasick and overnight the seasickness stopped, because we got into calm seas when we passed the Gulf Stream. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So on the icicles that were hanging on the -- on the <span class="DLF">railing</span> started melting and the waves were pretty high, I was one sitting there where this fella that played on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , he was a -- quite an artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He improvised music and arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Arrangements of popular tunes, especially American tunes. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And there was a young lady, who was a war bride and she came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to rejoin her fiancé. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And these two fell in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Never forget that scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , she and that young man walked down the gangplank and her fiancé, the former GI and his folk were standing there with flowers to wait to -- to receive her. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And this young man walked down with her, carrying her suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And actually big suitcases were taken in by the porters for the customs, but these little handbags carrying something for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And we observed that, because we were already aware of that, because that was the talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">She says, “T don’t know what to tell my fiancé.” </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We were friends on that -- on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , you know, I have a few pictures that show us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And then they walked down to her fiancé and his folks and she says, “I have to tell you that I fell in love on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and this is the man.” </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don’t know what the words were that they exchanged there, but this was one of the scenes of that arriving -- arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was one young lady who said she’s going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eagle Pass</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">A Parisian woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="159"><span class="DLF">Eagle Pass</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , that’s at the <span class="DLF">Mexican border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean, this is an <span class="BUILDING">outpost</span> where you -- where the cows walk in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and watermelons [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, with her I was 1n correspondence after I came here, for a few weeks or a couple months or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And she wrote to me she doesn’t know how to deal with that, but from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eagle Pass</span> , she never knew that it would be this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And then she -- she devised a -- a subterfuge where her mother was writing her a letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> that the grandmother is very ill and is about to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So she told her husband, he was her husband already, that she’s going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to the funeral of her grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Later I found out that she wrote to him that she is not coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eagle Pass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And [indecipherable], these are these spur of the moment situations where people in the war get together, fall in love, don’t know what the future will be and then you transplant somebody from <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  Realized that I have to -- to stay with my attitude and opinion that it is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And whoever -- whenever anybody will talk to me about it, I will immediately stand up to that person and speak back and talk back and stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I made up my mind that if anybody, at that time, will tell me something about a nigger, which I learned after a few weeks and months that this is the word that is not supposed to be -- of course some of the black people call each other that way, but that is the -- to differentiate between me and you. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I am the good black and you are the nigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I found that out that that’s discrimination among the groups themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Jews, blacks, Catholics, others. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We all human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But, as soon -- I made up my mind that I will not keep quiet in the face of adversity or bigotry or prejudice, bias. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Because I’ve learned my lesson in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Because if you keep quiet, you prob -- be -- you become a -- a co-conspirator. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">When you keep quiet you become part of -- of the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">If you keep quiet, that means in the face of the person that -- that- that mentions these names or says these names or demeans anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">If you keep quiet, that person walks away in the knowledge -- or in the -- with the opinion that you agree with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They will never think that you might disagree. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Oh, he has nothing to say, he agrees with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So I made up my mind, if anybody will speak about -- to me about a nigger, I will immediately reply to that person, “You know what you just did is very offensive to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And I’m not so sure that when I turn my back to you, where you have been speaking very nicely to me, I’m not so sure that when I turn my back to you, you will not call me a kike. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">That goes hand in hand.” </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And my friend Herbie, that I mentioned to you, the one -- Freedman, the one who I -- was one -- one of the first friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">When we went down to <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> and we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night after we had taken some girls we went out with, friends and -- and dates and taking them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we grabbed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> on <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and asked him to take us back to <span class="DLF">Parkhats Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">The cabby said to my friend Herbie, who was perfect in English, of course, he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here, went to the military and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So, Herbie got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and he told him, “Go <span class="DLF">Parkhats Avenue</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So the fella says to him, “Oh, that’s Hebetown.” </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You know what Herbie said? “</span><span class="sentence" id="375">Pull over to the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Pull over to the side, we want to get out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That taught me a lesson right then and there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">That Herbie and I, we were on the same page, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">There -- naturally <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 1s -- was a society that was not in every respect to my liking. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But on the other hand, I felt also that it was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could -- I had no longer -- I did no longer have a fear of -- of saying I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">See, I have -- I have the -- the opportunity to come back in kind if somebody says to me, “You can’t live in my <span class="REGION">area</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I can say, “You don’t live in my <span class="REGION">area</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Or -- as bad as it is, but I have a comeback. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I am -- I am on an equal footing with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So I realize that in spite of everything, it was still a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that I can acclimate myself to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  How long did it take you to realize that it was safe to say that you were Jewish, because it was so unsafe to say that in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  You know, when I went here to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and I didn’t see people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> sneering or -- or -- | -- I -- I knew that right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But took awhile to -- to realize all that and that I was not afraid to -- and that I’m -- to say that I’m Jewish, came almost -- within a -- within a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Because I had my -- my examples there, of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And -- and I also knew that there was support for me when -- when something might go wrong with me, from people who are not Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  And Herbie was -- was not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  No, no, Herbie was Jewish.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Yeah, Herbie was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He s-still is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Bretholz, did you -- I understand you -- I believe I read in your memoirs, in you epilogue that -- that you didn’t talk about your Holocaust experience for a long while. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Can you talk about why that -- why that was and when you did first start talking about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t talk for 14 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It was too hard to reflect on it, to come to terms with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I hadn’t heard anything from my mother and sisters and the guilt was there and -- the knowledge that you can’t do much about it, was a heavy weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I worked, so I had my work and I had my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">In 1960, when I had left Standard Textile and went into partnership, into the <span class="BUILDING">liquor business</span> , I heard a radio program. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It was one of those talk hosts -- talk show hosts, who -- earlier -- years -- that dates back now, over 30 years of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And the man who ran that program, who was the -- the talk show host was a -- a Methodist minister by the name of Luther Starnes. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We became very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Luther had a call-in program and it was at the time when a marine, a young marine died while he was exercising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris Island</span> with the -- in training. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And a mother called -- a woman who may have not been the mother of one of those marines. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And the debate went on, how should this training go to toughen our boys and to make them into men and make them into -- for the defense of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Oh, here’s the man there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Oh, excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Will -- will that disturb you with that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  So the lady said to Luther Starnes, Luther, if it’s necessary for defense of our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to toughen our boys, let’s train them to be killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Let’s train them to be good soldiers 1s one thing, but let’s train them to be killers, bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So -- so there was the -- the break in the -- in the program, during the commercial break, I picked up the phone and called Luther and I told him what bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He says, “You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Let’s have lunch together.” </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And we had lunch a couple days later, which was exactly on the sixth of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Sixth of November, 1961, I believe. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="422">60 or ‘61, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And it was on the day -- the anniversary of the day that I had escaped from -- from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we became very good friends and we formed a group, of which I was the initiator, basically, with him, called Preyudiced Anonymous, like Alcoholics Anonymous, Preyudiced Anonymous, based on the premise that when we’re prejudiced, we have an illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We don’t admit to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It’s colorless, it’s odorless, you know, it’s tasteless, it’s very insidious, but you’re prejudiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And when you’re prejudiced you have to admit that you are before you can cure it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Just like an alcoholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So we called it Preyudiced Anonymous and it formed -- it turned into a group of over 100 - 150 people -- member -- members. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And then it fell apart because people moved away and those who went, we went out to speak to groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Did a lot of programs, got a lot of material on that that I still ha-have on hand from them -- from then. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And that’s how I started speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Because I realized that unless I speak up, I -- I will promote wh-what they are espousing. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Yo-You can’t let the bigots get away with their attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And Preyudiced Anonymous was that -- I have a plaque downstairs on that and everything, this dates back. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">This is now what’s it, ‘98? </span><span class="sentence" id="436">This is 37 years of, whew -- time. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Got a little older since then, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  So that’s when you first started talking in public --
ANSWER:  That’s when I first started talking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  -- to friends and to other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Yeah, other people and to meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I found my language, I found the way to express it and nat -- not to become shy -- gun shy in the face of adversity. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And when we went to these groups, we had flak from those groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Why you goody - goody, bleeding heart, this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Because if you don’t learn the lesson from history, who was that, Santanyana said that? </span><span class="sentence" id="446">If you do not learn the lesson from history, we are condemned to repeat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And by that -- on that premise, we went out talking, like we -- we had blacks, whites, Christians, Jews, atheists. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">We had a group of people, of -- from all denominations and walks of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And one fella came up with a saying -- and -- in those days it was the liberty lobby that -- that promulgated the -- the -- the -- the -- the slogan, “<span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , love it or leave it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Well, this fella was a -- a minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And he was also a marriage counselor. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He says, “I can replace that slogan. </span><span class="sentence" id="453"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , love it and change it, for the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Let’s all do it together.” </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And then we had one fella who spoke -- black fella who actually had served some time in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and then joined us because he educated himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He came up with the saying -- I'll never forget that, people applauded him. “</span><span class="sentence" id="457">We’re getting an A in moon, but we’re flunking earth.” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So we -- we were a group who became -- we called it a group whose time had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">We called ourselves Preyudiced Anonymous. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Patterned after the panel of American women. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Have you ever heard of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  In those days, in the 60’s, there was a group of women, who went out to speak to organizations and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and institutions and they had a panel where they discussed the aspects of prejudice and -- and what can be done about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And was called the panel of American women. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So we said, let’s have a panel of fellas, men. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The women can do their way, they -- they have -- they have time during the day perhaps, to do their meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We are -- because in those days women were not still involved in a two -- two family earning pattern and so women stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- more in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So they had time during the day to go out, instead of going in a -- go to a coffee clutch, they went to have a meeting in a -- in -- in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The men were working during the day, so we got together in the evenings, or on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I never forget -- we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> a snowy morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">On a weekend [indecipherable] to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Omni</span> -- it was I think <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Omnibus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was a -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> there was a program called Omnibus. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> , a few blocks down from -- from a -- a -- Rockwell’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="474"><span class="BUILDING">Rockwell’s headquarters</span> , the Nazi Rockwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">In -- on -- on <span class="DLF">Wilson Boulevard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">What was his first name? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Lincoln Rockwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He was the -- the American Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They flew the flag there, the Nazi flag on <span class="DLF">Wilson Boulevard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I once wrote about that and said, “Our troops went to Europe to -- to get the Nazi flag down from the <span class="BUILDING">Eiffel Tower</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Acropolis</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and you come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> and you see a -- you see an- a swastika flying.” </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Whether it’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lincoln</span> , <span class="REGION">Nebraska</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Anyway, that was the group that we formed and so I found -- I found my -- my voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And then in 1962, I got notified by the Vienna Jewish community, that the names of my mother and sisters do not appear on the list of those who have returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">In the book I call it quite a euphemism. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Instead of saying they were murdered at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , their names are not listed -- do not appear on the list of those who have returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">You know, that’s a nice way of saying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But by that time I’d found out what happened to my mother and sisters and I could begin to reconcile things although the guilt stayed with me for many years until someday later, in fact maybe eight, 10 years ago, I went to a psychiatrist and consulted and had a few sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And he said to me, you know, “If your mother were able to come back for just a moment -- 1f she were coming back for just an hour maybe and -- and say one sentence to you, she would probably say, “I’m glad I urged you to leave.’”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Because it was she who urged me to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">She was the one. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">If not for her, I would not maybe have gotten my stuff together and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">B-But she says, “You must go because for men, for boys, this is not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">See, she was very prescient.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes, come to terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Because I had to dig up things and realize that I’m here now to tell a story and I cannot let the past be overwhelming me with these emotions when I’ve got -- I’ve got a family now and I got a life now and let’s face it by attrition and by the passing of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">My mother wouldn’t be here now anyway, which does not eliminate the fact that she was murdered, but I have to come to that -- to that realization and I have to come to that reconciliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And I called Michael up like every other night. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I say, “You know, I’m -- I’m now on pa -- I’m now on question 18 and this is 135 quest -- and I’ve had it already for about two weeks.” </span><span class="sentence" id="530">He says, “I’m not rushing you. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You take your time, you do -- put your -- put your -- your thoughts into it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And before you know it, I had answered all 135 questions and that was the book? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">No, it was not the book, this was the book, this was three or four chapters of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And then after that my writing came much easier, because I already knew what the -- the essence of it 1s, not just that I was 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and worked on th-the so and so, but I was surrounded by things and I spoke to people and people had reactions. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So, I could reconcile it and -- and -- and find this a very- areal catharsis. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And when I was finished with it, I felt -- ’'d like to do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I -- I felt a letdown. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was good to know that it was finished, but there was a letdown because I hadn’t -- I -- I was actually looking forward to every new chapter, every new paragraph wh-when I was doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I wrote til three, four in the morning, because I’m a night person. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And when I woke up during the night and a thought came to me, I went to this tab -- this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> full with papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I went to it and I wrote down my -- more notes, you know.

QUESTION:  I think you wrote in your memoirs that the war didn’t really end for you until 1962, when you got the news about your sister and your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  That’s what I just referred to. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That when I got this, I had -- there was a -- this was a milestone. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So I had a -- a closure of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It was the closure to know what had happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Not that I had many doubts that this was it, but when you don’t have the fin -- the -- the official word, you still have some hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Because people, after so many years, as you'll read from time to time, get together and find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But it was a closure. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And the only way it can ever be a closure is that I do not know where they’re buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">That is the -- that is the -- the big thing, because most people do not realize the luxury of -- that they have in knowing the burial place of a relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Father, mother, uncle, aunt, grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Even if you never go to that <span class="DLF">gravesite</span> , the knowledge that it’s there and that you can go if you would want to, is very comforting. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And it is almost a luxury for those who have that comfort, have that knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Now, I do -- to me there’s something like a surrogate for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">When I go to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and I see that mound of shoes there, I look at it with -- with some form of -- devotion of some sort or reminiscence or -- what do I want to call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I look at it with some sort of a solemn feeling that perhaps, perhaps by the f -- most farfetched possibility, one of those shoes belonged to my mother or my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So I use that as a reference, as a point of reference to give me some comfort and solace. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And we have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Just like some people go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and step on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and say perhaps the bones and the ashes of my family are here, so I’m here on hallowed ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">To me those shoes mean that. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Those combs and toothbrushes there, that are -- you -- you know, there -- at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">When I’m going to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , I get shivers, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , the way it is constituted there, could not have allowed me to escape, because the bars are bolted to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Solidly bolted, I -- I would have never touched them. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I would have never been able to bend them apart like I described doing it at my -- that point of my escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  How often do you go to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  I go probably more often than I would like to and would I -- that I would volunteer to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I was there a day before it officially opened, with the WJZ. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I have the tape of that, JZ TV, they went there to do a -- a program and I -- they took me along to do some color -- explanation and get my 1-input. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Then there are these bus trips that <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> take, organization ik -- invite me to come as a dossent. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So I speak about it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> going there, what they might expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I tell them right away, this is not a trip into serendipity. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">This is not a -- a pleasure excursion. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When you will come out of there, you will feel tired, you will feel abused and you will have a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And a lot of questions that will never be answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And tell them a little bit about -- what my story, show them my star and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Then, on the way back, sometime there are questions on something that they saw and they would like something explained or elaborated on. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Most of the times, it’s silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The majority of the trips back, I do not get questions, although I say right away, when we’re -- if you have any questions during this trip, please don’t hesitate. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">That’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I leave it at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">No urging, no prodding, no encouraging it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But, very seldom. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The people are really thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And the majority of them, when we leave and we get back, say that they will have to go back at least one more time, because you can’t really absorb it, it’s -- it’s too much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Flora and I met at a wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">My good friend Herbert Freedman married Joyce Herman and Flora had a friend who was also a friend of Joyce and they became bridesmaids to Joyce. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Flo’s friend, Sandra, bridesmaids to Joyce and I was best man to Herbie. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">That’s how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">That was in November of 1951 and we were married in July of 1952, which will now be 46 years and Herbie was best man at my wedding, in ‘52. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So that’s how I met Flo, in -- at -- at a wedding in 1951. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I was -- just about four and a half years after I had arrived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">In ‘52 we were married, in July and in August of *52, a month later, I acquired American citizenship, five years after my arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And that is the -- that is the story of my -- of my meeting with -- with Flo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  Wh-When was the first time you told her about what had happened to you during the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  I did not speak too much about it in the beginning, but little by little it -- it came out, because in ‘54 we went to Europe to meet the remnant of my family, my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And a cousin that had survived who was an Austrian, she met us in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I write about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and spoke to my aunt and -- and then my other relatives that were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> since then, my uncle died, my aunt died, my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Time takes it’s toll. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And during that trip to Europe and on the way back, I started to tell Flo more and more because she had met the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But in general, I did not elaborate too much on -- on it, because I didn’t want to dwell too much on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Seven years ago, when I spoke to <span class="BUILDING">Social Security agency</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodlawn</span> , a young lady came up to me and she says, “Leo,” she looked at me, “Leo, I didn’t know these things.” </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I said, “Wait a minute, wait a minute, you are?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="610">I’m Jane.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="611">Jane, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">How time goes by,” I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It’s a girl I had taken out, dating, good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And there she was so many years later, maybe, I don’t know -- maybe some 30 -- some years later. “</span><span class="sentence" id="615">But you know what you just -- what I just heard you tell, you never told me about that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I said, “Jane, in those days I didn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I didn’t want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I didn’t feel like talking about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But that was much -- much later than -- than when I took Flo to -- when Flo and I went to Europe in ‘54. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Of course we lived together and it had to come out, correspondence and pictures and -- and the star, I had the star with me and I told her a few things here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And Flo was always very, very understanding in these things and very compassionate about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Much more than the average person I would think. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And understood it and -- and -- and even today, when she reads about these things or hears about this, “How could that -- how could they do that to -- to the children? </span><span class="sentence" id="624">How could they do that to the old people?” </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And she understands it. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">In fact, one of her first friends, girlfriends in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> was a girl -- a young woman who -- who had survived a -- a camp and -- and came back after the war, from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So Flo always understood a lot about these things and was very understanding and compassionate and -- had strong feelings about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Did she not s -- tell you that -- encourage you to confront the -- the past? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I read where you -- you said something about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yeah, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Yeah, she did, it’s a -- be good to -- you know, to -- to find out and to do the best you can with -- of -- of course when we had children later, I had to be very careful with the kids, not to inflict some of these post traumatic syndrome aspects on them, or pass it on to them, which in many families has become a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Many children of survivors are very actively involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">My kids are not so involved, although they know of it -- of 1t, but my son never wanted to hear anything about it and he was strongly affected by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So we had to moderate my memories and expression of the memories with -- with the aspect of -- of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">My -- my cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- I’m not going to give anything away, but as I didn’t -- didn’t know there is an ending to this that -- that is a very interesting ending, pertaining to my cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- never told her kids anything about her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">The kids grew up entirely sheltered from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Now, I didn’t shelter them. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They -- they knew that I had meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">They knew I had the meeting with Prejudiced Anonymous and they knew that in Prejudiced Anonymous I spoke about my experiences, because I had found my voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And some of it was reported in the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">A fella by the -- Lou Panos followed us from one meeting to the other and always described our meetings -- was very impressed with what we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But they knew about it, because evidently I did speak about it at those meetings, because that was the essence of what I wanted to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Look what prejudice did in Europe and how it can affect us all here if we do not -- if we do not speak up and talk back and stand up for what we think is -- 1s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But Flo, yeah, en-encouraged me to -- to a -- to -- didn’t discourage me to talk about it, but she was also encouraging and -- and saying you have to -- you have to make up your mind and all that -- how to deal with it and deal with it the best way you can and you can’t let your life be affected by it for the rest of -- of your years, you know, so.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We sat down in a family and sometime it happened at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> , sometime - there was never too much reaction from them on -- on an -- on an -- they understood it, but then on emotional point. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But -- but my son was definitely affected by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Whenever we spoke about something, about the -- these events, the Holocaust, he would walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He could not -- he could not cope with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  And how did that affect you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  You talked about the lesson of the Holocaust and I wanted to read you this quote from Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">You may have heard of -- heard him or read his -- this, from April 24th. “</span><span class="sentence" id="895">This is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.” </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Do you agree with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  Well, after the Holocaust, we have seen that nationhood for the -- for the Jews was a survival necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Had there not been a Holocaust, there probably would not have been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But had there been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> in the 30’s and 40’s, I am convinced that there would not have been a Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">All you have to see is Entebbe. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">That- that is my conviction, because we lost a million and a half children. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">A million and a half children. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">As somebody wrote -- a woman wrote, Gerta Weissman Klein wrote that they’re ordinary children, but a lot of them could have become very extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="906"><span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> is a <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> with 350,000 people or 400,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">There were a million and a half children who could have grown into a nation of 30 or 40,000,000, had they been allowed to live, but they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Had there been a state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , these children would not have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">In that respect, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">With other things, I can disagree with Netanyahu, but he was elected. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And perhaps the -- the labor government is more acceptable to a lot of people, because they were, perhaps, more -- more amenable. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">But Rabine also was not a man who was going to have his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I am sure he was not that kind of a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">In fact, Rabine was a general and Netanyahu was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But Netanyahu is also a man who wrote an important book about terrorism, he is an expert on that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  Well, had there not been a Holocaust, perhaps I would never have come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that is possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> was already in the stages of -- of -- of planning, or infancy or a incubation with the Balfour Declaration, 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Of course, in 1895, Hertzel wrote The Judenstat, a Jewish state, which he became aware of through the Dreyfuss affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And he said, if we will it will not be a -- if we will it, it will not be a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But, while it was in -- in it’s infancy, then the -- the -- the idea, it -- it became -- it became a -- a dire necessity after the Holocaust, simply because -- because the proof was there, that nobody -- nobody was accepting the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">The world knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">The -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship Saint Louis</span> came to the <span class="REGION">American coast</span> in 1939 and Gustov Shroeder, the captain with the swastika on his lapel, called the Coast Guard, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to shore, pleading with them, “Let -- don’t let me take these people back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He was crying, a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Was he a Nazi or was he a -- a -- acripto antagonist, perhaps, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">But he wore the swastika and he was the captain of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> - <span class="DLF">America line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And he’s, “Don’t let me take these people back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And those who wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were saved, but the ones that depo -- disembarked in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they wound up in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">So the captain -- Nazi captain was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And when you take that in history - in the context of history, you -- you -- you will see that -- that’s conjecture, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">But the impetus was there for the state and the -- and the sympathy was there for the state and it -- and it became. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And today there are problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">There are problems within that state. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">We know them and we hope they will overcome them.</span></p>
