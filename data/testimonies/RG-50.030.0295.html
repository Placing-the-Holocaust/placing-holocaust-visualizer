<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What -- explain to me what this meant, that all of the sudden you were a Romanian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  It meant that the laws, which I don't know at all, I was forbidden to throw stones, because when I threw stones and I got paddled on my behind from a policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And this was all of the punishment I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So therefore, I'm Romanian which was paddled by a Romanian policeman and he didn't get punished for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  How did you learn that you were a Romanian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  On all the <span class="DLF">street corners</span> , the street names were changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They didn't change the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They stayed the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Now I was born in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Number Five</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Number Five</span> stayed all the time, so I knew I'm a Romanian citizen and I have to sing a new national anthem and we sang it because we were told we have to love the king, so we loved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And here I know that means "Long live the King." </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And if he lives long, I'm a Romanian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  You were telling me that one day you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  -- and you learned you were Romanian and you went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told your family you're a Romanian now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- my father was dead already, I lost him right after the first World War -- and I said, "Mother, you know we are Romanians." </span><span class="sentence" id="67">She said, "How do you know this?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="68">Teacher said so." "</span><span class="sentence" id="69">No, the teacher said so, it cannot be. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The teacher must make a mistake." '</span><span class="sentence" id="71">No, mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Look, I will show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Come out and I show you new street signs." </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Mother came out and didn't believe me, but then she read by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The Street of Michael the Brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So I kept this and I know from time I was born Number Six.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  How did this change of nationality affect you, other than street signs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  It affect me so that I was sitting and trying as much as possible to learn the few words. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Number Five. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I learned it and it was very nice for me so I could remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And my tongue worked like a Romanian tongue, so it was all right and I was very proud of -- yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  But what kind of changes did you all have to go through? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I mean, was it difficult? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Was it complicated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, it was very difficult because I had to learn that if I cannot speak these words correctly, I get 25 over my behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I was paddled 25 times as the whole class looked on. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And I was paddled one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I had to feel it and I couldn't sit very long after this. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But it was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So we made fun of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did the mood of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">People went silent and thoughtful. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They wouldn't stop the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then they laughed about this new different idea of the let's say the life of the Romanian because they couldn't speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Nobody knew what he talked, nobody knew what he said and nobody knew what it means, what he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  What about regulations or --
ANSWER:  Oh, no, we learned this just by the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Were there any new laws instituted that you had to deal with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  There were new laws instituted because I didn't use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I couldn't use them because I didn't know what they meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I tried very hard but it was all right and it was fun for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We all learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  What about laws pertaining to Jewish people? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Did that change with the Romanian Government?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Laws which pertained to Jewish people was that they cannot go at six in the morning to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They had to go at seven because it was a law, it has to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And then came the other law that they have to pray shorter, cannot pray so long and cannot use the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for four hours or five hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And this was a very tough law for us because we used the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But it was contained to four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Did this impact your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  It impact my family because my father was a watchmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Watchmaker was called the man who repairs a watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So it impaired my father very much and he was swearing in German because he couldn't speak Romanian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  So your father was still living when <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  What other -- what other sort of official actions were taken that affected the Jewish community under <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The idea of using the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> shorter and living in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was -- had quite a Jewish population, the idea was that we had to obey these laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we knew very well that if we don't obey it will be something bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But we knew it that they who didn't obey these laws, they have also 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was called . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Those that they changed, it means 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And this you will suffer yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And they, especially the Jews, didn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But not many got beaten 25 times on their behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So it was an example for the whole population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Now, the Romanian -- were you in at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Were the Romanians particularly anti-Semitic at that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They were used to live with the Jews because without the Jews it's no fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But they needed the Jews for handing out 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And they knew it right away, who would get it? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">This was very clear for them that it was so. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But when -- until 1918, 1920, and then they moderated us so that they have quite let loose this law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Why did they moderate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Life became, all of the sudden, easier for the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Did you experience as a boy --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  -- anti-Jewish feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Always when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the -- got beaten by the larger Romanian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was not very happy, but you use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Was your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> mixed or was it primarily Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Oh, no, mixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  You had friends who were not Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  They were friends which were not Jewish and which I appreciate very much because they like to play soccer with me, because I was a very good goalkeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And therefore, I became their equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They even didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The younger boys didn't know what to do with anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They were told, "Hate the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So they thought, "Yes, I hate the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But that was all that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But there were no beating up Jews, boys to boys, because we were on the same team, the football team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  So, who were the kids that -- that made anti-Jewish comments to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Anti-Jewish comments were very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">There were the Romanian that choose to shit in your hat and tell the mother this 1s good. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They made a rhyme and had it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  But didn't you say that other kids would -- would beat you and --
ANSWER:  Oh, no, that was after 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Yes, after 1920 they were running after us because they were told that they could beat us up and nothing would happen to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  So is there anything else that you can think of that really changed when <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> took over, for you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It was very clear it had to do with our so-called profession; watchmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">One bought the watch and said, "I don't know what to do, my watch goes and all of the sudden doesn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Then I shake it, it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Then I don't shake it, it doesn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So I have to shake it all the time and I cannot go shaking my watch all over the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So therefore, it's a dirty Jew sold me this watch and he knew it wasn't good."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Were there any other laws that pertained?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So you went to -- you went to a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  And what were you studying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  What was I studying? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The regular normal disciplines which every child studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">There where even a little more strict for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And interesting, the teachers were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Now, they got a -- how do you say -- a diploma for their teachers, and they were kept as very important people, those teachers, because they just kept like Romanian teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Were you finished -- when you finished the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , then what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  There was already <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I finished the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and then I had to decide if I want to go -- <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> there and then we decided we want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">This was a little harder because, first of all, to be accepted in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , you have to pass an exam, which is the Romanian exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And here we have to know the Romanian history. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">This was very complicated because they did not have a history. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The Romanians did not have, by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And the commission which had to ask us these questions, they didn't know themselves what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And they were very strict, especially with the Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">To answer what they want to hear, that they had a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> just as good as a <span class="BUILDING">Romanian university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So we had to invent it and to speak of it, and we were quite intelligent boys and really the Jewish kids were flunked for this examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So we were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And now, we were open for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And this was the biggest problem for us because we were not accepted in the <span class="BUILDING">Romanian university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And most of the students, now over the age of 18, 19, they went into <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> to study there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And this was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The neighboring countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I studied music. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And I got it right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And I was accepted right away because I was a good violin player.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Where did you learn to play violin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  This I learned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernivtsi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And there was an old man who played at weddings and birthdays, I don't know whatever he played. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And he played pretty nice and I admired him and I wanted to be like him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  So you studied throughout <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  All of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Because the school system there is from 8 to 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And 8 to 12 you learn the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">After 12 you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you have the lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And -- and this was very pleasant because it's only four hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So it was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Sure you learned other disciplines like arithmetic and what you have to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  You were taking the violin in addition to your --
ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  So age 12 wasn't every day?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Then, when did you do the violin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  The violin, I did it all the time from 12 to 12 midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Now, then you were studying in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Music Academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And they accepted me right away there and this was very nice for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I was accepted there and I was somehow interested to go to a chamber music class at the second <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And then they accepted me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So I had two <span class="BUILDING">conservatories</span> , it was called, and I studied there.</span></p>

"</span><span class="sentence" id="382">Oh, they attacked." </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And all of the sudden you can see soldiers in German uniform lying dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And people who look closer saw the image of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , Jews dressed 1n uniform.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  This was in 1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Yeah, 1940, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So people are deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Taken out and down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was full, then comes the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So -- and it was really murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">It was tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> you see people holding each other and crying, "Why us? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">What did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So -- and then the people talk to each other, then they say, "No, we never said -- we never. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We were the happiest people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They said, "Yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Because we knew they liked Jews and like everybody. . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They were did what they were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It was murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And so therefore, you heard it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">But it is clear that they didn't do anything, anything to make these people feel better or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">No nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And, therefore, this was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And so when we came in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , my mother was so natural as I. My mother, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You will see your ."</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Coming to the wedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The whole time was very crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It was -- we knew of people get married for a pound of coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">People get married for a pair of shoes, a pair of soles, for fixing my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And so people get married for getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">No reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So therefore, don't think for a minute there's a reason, if anybody can tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Philosophically, can you talk around it as much as you want, but in reality, you cannot explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So therefore, it is has nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">We just got married and now we sit here and wherever we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And nobody sit down next to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Everybody says, "No, no, where we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="768">What is this." </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And we did -- the most thing was that we were so mentally derooted here and there.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="774">Okay, take us to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">What's wrong with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So guessing . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Therefore the basic problem is you cannot explain and nobody can explain it for the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But married, many people got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So there was no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="781">You didn't go on the first deportation, did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  The first was all the Jews should go in this <span class="DLF">street</span> and this <span class="DLF">street</span> and that <span class="DLF">street</span> and that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And this will be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And nobody, no Jew is permitted to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So how do you get some 30,000 Jews in five minutes here? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Because if you were had -- -- if you would have anything, any belongings after five, they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So people stand there and cry and yell. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">You don't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I got a wonderful book of a friend of mine who was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and wrote a book, The Art of Survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Therefore, this is old. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Now I knew a captain who was sitting on a horse and riding around there, I said, "Look, captain, what should I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And just once he takes a pencil and writes on paper, "Samuel Flor and his whole family will be deported with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Yeah, it's nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I still have it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">However, he cannot help me and I think and I have to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And we went to a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> and there were all the people were lying there on blankets and so -- but it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And we laid there and then, all of the sudden we heard, "Gerty, Gerty." </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And there was a girl by the name of -- I don't know, she will tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And this woman here was with Gerty 1n the same class in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="801">Come up here." </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And SO we went up to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">We don't know where to step because the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> rot. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So we went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">She lived in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and -- she and her husband -- and there we were two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">In the meantime, they put boards around us so you couldn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">You were locked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I don't know what to say and how to say it because, all of the sudden, you were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But like we were with the Romanians, they put us also 200, 300 in such a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We were there eight days. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">We said, "Oh, it will be like the Romanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They will send us back." </span><span class="sentence" id="813">It was not like 1t was with the Romanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And then came those with the name from A to D should go down to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will stop, you go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops and those have to get in. "</span><span class="sentence" id="816">Get in, get in, go fast." </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And so now they move. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Where do they go? </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So therefore, this is a transportation and the people are taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Now what it plays in role, we walked into such a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">In our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , there were two dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Two men were lying there dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We yelled, "We have to take them out." "</span><span class="sentence" id="825">Shut up." </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And now the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> starts to move with the dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And the <span class="DLF">air</span> is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And so we have to -- there is such a little <span class="DLF">window</span> which has a. You can look through but you cannot do anything through this little <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We arranged so that everybody can stand five minutes next to the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So we switched five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And my mother was a genius. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">She said, "It's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Don't worry." </span><span class="sentence" id="834">What went down on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , too, a couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">He opens up a jar of -- what did they have there? </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Honey marmalade, I think, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And he had this knife and she yells at him and so he takes the knife and put dirt on her coat -- it's a raincoat she wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">She said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And he takes the marmalade, a piece in his hands and throws it at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Why you fight now? </span><span class="sentence" id="841">What are you fighting for? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Who's right? </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And so what should I tell you, this is -- these are tragic situations because I cannot tell these people you could be in five minutes dead, so when you're dead you cannot fight for the marmalade. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">What would it be then? </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So I hunt down with Gertrude and we sit in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And Gertrude doesn't cry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Sits there and said, "Do you know where we go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I said, "No, I don't know where we go and I don't want to know where we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">But do you know?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="851">I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So after three days of traveling -- but what do we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="853">All of the sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops and from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> is about six feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">From the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> to -- because we are on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , is a -- I would say from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , it's a little , another six feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And we went down and they yelled, "Move down here and do whatever you have to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">So we did whatever we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I always had fountain pen with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Do I have it? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Hey, hey, hey, she took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And a Romanian peasant boy, a soldier, looks at this grasps here, two pens and takes it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">An laughs and now he's happy, he knows he can't write. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">He cannot write but he has a pen, that's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">that means, not fountain pen -- it's pens that you have to put in ink and then you have to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So do I look at them, so poor sole. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">He doesn't know how dumb he 1s. . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So then we come, finally, to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> which is called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niesta</span> (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And this is <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And on this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , everybody should go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But everybody has to pay 20 lay (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I don't go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> , I don't pay 20 lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And then you get some -- what's a -- a whip over your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And so then you pay 20 lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Now you have to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> with the whip, you pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So, therefore, you cannot move and you're standing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> has a piece of wood standing here, and in back a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And we are like the headings. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">You stand there and all of the sudden somebody opened it up and people fall in, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Many couldn't swim, many could swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So I don't know who couldn't swim an who could swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And now we were . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">So my wife says, "No, I don't go on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I don't want <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="884">You see what happens to those who don't want to?" </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So -- and then we went to the other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , and there's another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , you have to go on <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And then they said, "Who has relatives or friends who want to call from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> should yell your name and then we bring them over." </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And we saw people, they looked like ghosts. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">They looked so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They were deported about a week ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">What a week did to those people, terrible.</span></p>
