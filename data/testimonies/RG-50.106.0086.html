<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, I think one of my sons put my name into the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I think my children are anxious for me to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And I'm really doing it to help the people to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I know we've got plenty of things to remember here, but I really want to do it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And I have never done much talk about it, so I feel like this is the time really to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  I also thought we could start by your simply telling me about your parents, their background, their education, and their families, their religious life, anything that you can think of, their personalities to talk about them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Do you know the birth dates? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I want to ask you the full names of your parents, but do you know their birth dates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Why don't you tell me their full names and where they were both born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  My dad was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cameron</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which I visited many times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  What was their background in terms of the kinds of families that they came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  I really don't know too much about my dad's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I did knowwhich my brother told me that he wasthere was something wrong, something that ignited. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I really don't remember the whole thing, but my mother was from a very plain, hardworking family, and I never knew my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I really only knew her brothers and they wereall had interesting professions. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They all did okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And that's all I really know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  You never knew the family members of your father's Hungarian family; 1s that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  I knew some of my father's brothers, but only when I was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Used to visit in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I just knew them as Uncle Chan (ph) or my fatherone of my father's brothers was a lawyer, Uncle Chandor (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And he had a couple of other brothers who I really did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And my mother had two brothers, whom I knew who visited us frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Why don't you tell me first how your father ended up coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then how your parents met?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  This is quite unusual because my dad always wanted to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And his father was, I guess, maybe tired of hearing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And he decided to give him a certain amount of money, I don't know how much, but I heard the story many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And he had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and one other <span class="DLF">port</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , I think were the largest hard <span class="DLF">ports</span> in Europe at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> purposely a few days ahead of time because wehis parents had some friends there whom he was supposed to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And at one of the visits, they had a tea 1n the afternoon, tea and coffee and cakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And he met my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And he took one look at her and really liked her a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And it was raining <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And my mother was there with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And he happened to have an umbrella, and he took them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And asked her mother if he may date her, and she said, oh, sure, if you would like to. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And this was the beginning of a wonderful relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  What year would that have been or you can probably figure out a general notion of what age they were, although I understand it's hard to be specific. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I think you told meoh, no, that was your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Do you have a sense of when he might have come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> for the purpose of going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Well, my brother would have been 85 now. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And so it's been quite a few years, and you don't want to take the time for me to figure it out right now, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Can I assume that that brother was born pretty soon after they got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Well, it was at least more than 12 months, that's for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And that brother, P.S., was my oldest brother, became a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I shall tell you about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  I'm interested in the fact, and you told me this in the preinterview that your mother was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I'm wondering what your sense or memories of the stories you heard from your parents led you to believe about what it meant for a Jew and a nonJew to get married in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  You know, it's funny, I never really gave that much thought because it wasI knew other people where their father was Jewish or vice versa and the mother was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And it was a mixed marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And they were very happy with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And there was never any talk about that much Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I didn't live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And it's really hard for me to answer that question because there was no problem in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I mean, my parents went everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My parents did a lot of traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Nobody discussed it and nobody asked me are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It just was foreign to me, and that's the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  I just realized, Marion, I didn't get the names of each of your parents, so why don't you give their complete names and spell their first names because you've already spelled the last name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  My dad's name was Morris, or Maurice Solomos (ph)didn't I mention that before? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And my mother's name was Bertha or Bertie (ph) most of her friends called bought Haagen, Haagen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So it was not an issue is what you're saying, the intermarriage was not an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Did your mother observe Christian holidays or go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and what kind of Jewish observances did she or your father and you participate in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I never remember my mother going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My dad went on the high holidays and occasionally on Friday night and would take us along. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I feel badly, but there are many things which really are not clear in my mind anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">There was neverhe took me along for some of the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I went later years to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> and studied Hebrew for a year or two and went to regular <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , but otherwise 1t was never an issue and nobody ever made an issue over it until Hitler came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Marion, why don't you talk about how the Christian celebrations that your family engaged in, kind of intermixed with the Jewish observances and holidays that you did with your father and brothers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, the biggest holiday, Christian holiday, in fact, the only Christian holiday that I can remember, we made a big fest over Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My mother always had a big Christmas tree up to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , and we had three <span class="INT_SPACE">front rooms</span> and all threeit was a <span class="INT_SPACE">ladies’ room</span> where my mother had special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ladies' furniture</span> , and a <span class="INT_SPACE">man's room</span> in the middle, which was all leather <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And all three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for about a week before Christmas were closed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And she always brought in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We each had either a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bridge table</span> or some type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they were packed with gifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But nobody was allowed in that <span class="DLF">door</span> , and it was such an exciting holiday for me and my brothers and my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I can't even describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And everybody got a big plate, a colorful paper plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And on the paper plates were all kinds of moassapin (ph) breads and candies and all sorts of fun things. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And that holiday we observed to the bitter end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Was there any discussion or conflict about celebrating Christmas because your father was Jewish and raising you Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  No, it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">At Hanukkah, he would light the candles, and sometimes my brothers were there, but some weren't there but it isn'tit wasn't very memorable to me and it wasn'tno fuss was made over. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I got to be honest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did the Christian relatives, the relatives of your mother come and join in the celebration, the Christmas celebration with you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  They sometimes came the day afterwards, but Christmas Eve we always had by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they used to alwaysthe tradition was that you ate carp and parsley potatoes with brown butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And my mother had a set. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">This is so hard to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">She had a set. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">She only used dishes at Christmastime and they were all painted and it was thel still remember it so vividly because they were all the bottom of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , and they were in these bluishgrayish colors with fish pictures under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And, oh, they were beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And all that went to the Naxis, everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  What Jewish celebrations did you participate in? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I think you said something to me about Purim when we talked earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, my dad took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Purim</span> to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was a good way. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We used to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> many years ago, but he had given up that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we used to gohad to walk and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> which was a good distance away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was a <span class="BUILDING">reform temple</span> , and everybody would march around. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And they would get candies and it was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That was the only Jewish holiday I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="BUILDING">reform temple</span> very far from where you lived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yes, very much so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  And you lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I lived close to the Hamburgthe main <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It wasn't too far away because I remember my brother in later years would walk up tohe became a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It wasit was a veryvery nice <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">There were only four <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I remember every bit of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Was itwould you characterize it as an upper middle class neighborhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I don't know if you would consider it now upper middle class, but in those days, it definitely was. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It had big <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> you entered. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">In fact, I could even describe it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It had three nice size <span class="INT_SPACE">front rooms</span> , which all closed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They had <span class="DLF">sliding doors</span> if you wanted to close them. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And if you could open them, they were all three open, and had a long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And we had threeandahalf bedrooms, actually, the half <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was for a housekeeper, and a large <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I would say it was a very beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I remember we had oriental rugs everywhere because my dad's brother was an oriental dealer and I guesseven the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And we had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I think in those days, nobody ever even heard of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And so I would say it was an upper middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But I really didn't know that much about upper middle class as a child or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Yes, I realize that's not a child's question. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you mentioned that you went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Was that near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was that?</span></p>

class="sentence" id="386">And as I was waving, I remember saying my raincoat isn't here. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">My raincoat isn't here. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Well, even my cousin couldn't catch the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but it really wasn't so terrible because Imy parents could have sent it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And anyway I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And it was a nice ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I had pleasant company in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> and somebody camesomebody was there already waiting with a sign with my name Tiaute Solomos (ph), please, you know, answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And so I went to him and he took me by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I had dinner there and went right to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> because I was tired emotionally and physically, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Well I wasn't a dreamer normally, but in the middle out of nowhere, I heard my mother saying Tiaute, that's what she used to call me. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And I thought I was dreaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And then I heard something knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And I still thought I was dreaming, but I wasn't dreaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">My mother had taken the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and come and rode all night through and got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> around four or 5:00 in the morning to bring me the raincoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And they decided to spendshe decided to spend the day with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> because my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> wasn't leaving until that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Well, to begin with, they didn't want to do it because it was costly, and they didn't feel like they should spend that money, but I guess they decided in the last minute that my mother wanted to do it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So we spent the whole day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and it was really wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We went sightseeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We did everything together. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It was sad, but it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I'm a little tearyeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So then from there we went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And she put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and all of the crying started again. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Excuse the interruption, but it is very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And we had to leave again so all of the kissing and the goodbyes went again. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trias</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And my mother took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Well, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trias</span> , and there again were arrangements and the travel agent seen that we were takenthat I was taken to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which was right in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And it was the worse <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> I have ever seen in my whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And it was a terrible experience because there were lots of sailors there. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I was really scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But I managed okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I locked my <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And the next morning I was supposed to in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trias</span> get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , which was going around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I mean, the shore of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , excuse me, the shore of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and my parents just felt like it was wonderful for me to take that trip because God knows when I ever come back to Europe, and they thought it would be a wonderful experience for me because it was a beautiful trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Well, Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">That's what they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And they canceled the trip and left us in this horrible <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I had to stay there for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">They gave us just enough money for the meals, very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The whole thing was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And then they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> after three days and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It stopped at every little stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And we sat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all night until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I know it wasn't that long of a drive normally. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Well, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and they transported us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> where you're getting your <span class="DLF">passage</span> to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And it was a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I really didn't know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There was one couple I got a little bit familiar with who were very kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And when I went out for dinner, they took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We went to dinner together, which helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Well, we got into this <span class="DLF">port</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and they had on the <span class="DLF">track</span> , right there waswas the alphabet and you were supposed to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> to wait for your passage for yourto get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Well, my name was Salomos (ph) which I mentioned before so I was standing under "S" and we got in there at 7:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And by five or 4:00 or 4:30, they closed the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And they made an announcement that everybody who 1s left has to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and wait there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Well, I was very, very tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I was just beside myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I wasn't going to go back into the horrible <span class="BUILDING">port hotel</span> , these two, they were important. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They booked us into thetook us to the cheapest little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I just sat on my suitcase and everybody else was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I just sat on my suitcase and cried my eyes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">As I said I was spoiled and I guess I shouldn't have done that, but I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And some young man came up and asked me what was the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">He was part of the <span class="DLF">ship line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And he said he was very sorry, he couldn't help me at all, but he'll call the manager of the department and I said well I'll sleep here. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I'm not leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So the manager came and he asked me my name and lo and behold he knew my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He had done business in the <span class="BUILDING">Hamburg bank</span> with him and he knew exactly who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Well, this gentleman was an elderly gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He took me for dinner right close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He saw to it that I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and he was an utter stranger and I felt like I wanted to hug him and kiss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I didn't because I was shy at the time but he was a godsend and I think God was good to me because from that time on I had a lot of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And from there I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and slept on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the next morning we sailed for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Marion, I'd like to back up a little bit, I don't think if you remember it, yes, you do, the date that you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , this was December of '39, wasn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Yes, it was Decemberit was December '39 and it was aboutit must have been about the 5th of December if I am correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And the name of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Saturnia</span> and our experience was very unusual on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was very nice and everything went very smoothly and one night on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> they hadthey had dancers, it was like a regularalmost like a <span class="DLF">cruise line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And somebody asked me to dance, a young med student that had told me his story. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He was studying in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">He was not Jewish, but he couldn't get into <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> so he studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because of the war and all what was going on, he was coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So we were dancing and all of a sudden in the middle of the dance, we noticed that the machinethe noise of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> had stopped and everybody was leaving the party down there and going to the sideside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , what do you call the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Anyway, and what had happened, you could see in the distance a tiny little pole coming out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">In spite of the fact 1t was dark, you could see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And it was the first time in my whole life that I had ever seen in person a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> coming to the top of theexcept in the movies I saw it, but it was very, very exciting and very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Well, what had happened 1s that 1t was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French submarine</span> and they were taking two of the men and the women were hysterical and crying and screaming, off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They were chemists. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They were engineers and chemists and they wanted some information. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They took them off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with the promise that they would arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> within a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Well, after I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> and after I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , there was a big article in the paper about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> 's name was the Saturnia, that these fellows were physicists, maybe that's what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I'm sorry, but it was a very, very scary experience because we thoughtI don't knowwe were really scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And they took them the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And the article in the paper described how they had come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They wanted some information and I to this day don't know what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  When you left in December of '39, did you know or have the sense that this was approaching the last opportunity for Jews to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And what was your mother saying to you about your parents coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  When I left I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">My parents through the whole time while we were making arrangements for this trip, my mother kept saying don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We'll get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They will call our quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We will see you I bet within a year we will be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Well, she brainwashed me and so did my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They all thoughtthey'll be there and everything will be okay again. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I lived with that thought all of these years when I first came all of these months that I was sure my parents were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Well, need I say more. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">My father wasparents were both taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I have a letter here, which I brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I just hadn't seen that letter in 40 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I put all of my parents' letters in a box, and I hadn't looked at it in a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And in this much I had this interview I brought them out, and I found a letter from my aunt where she was telling me in the letter that she was packing up things. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">This letter was written in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">She was packing up things becauseshe was helping my parents and my mother get ready because the Gestapo was picking them up to take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Well, I didn't know all of this until after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I didn't find out about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And then I also heard from my aunt's husband, my mother's brother that the Naxis approached her and said you divorce that Jew and we will let you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And evidently my mother used the same words she told me: I had the good years with him, I'm going to have the bad years and hopefully those bad years will get good again. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Well, unfortunately they didn't get good again. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">My dad died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because he was diabetic and he didn't have any shots and by all rights I think the Naxis should have let her go, but they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They brought her into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">She went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and I had heard they made her work in the laundry and then she went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> in later years and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  How do you know the details of your father's death, that 1s, that he died 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> on the way and how do you know what little you know about your mother's death in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  I really don't know much about that except that my Uncle Willie who was my nonJewish uncle and worked for the government in a small way. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I really don't know what he did exactly, found out that my father died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They did not give him insulin, and he was a very bad diabetic and he couldn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And he also told me that my mother was brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and made to work in the laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And that's all I heard, and she died, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And it was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">To this day, I have a hard time really accepting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  When your aunt writes you this letter in 1946, she's referring back to an earlier period when she helped your parents to get ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I assume that was 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Yeah, it must have been much earlier because I got letters after '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The firstoh, quite a few months I would say we were still able to correspond. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I had met in the meantime several people, you know, a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And I met a man who we fell in love and I was writing my mother that I was going to get married and she says, you know, she was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">My parents were both happy about that, but she kept saying please don't have a baby until I come because I want to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And that went on for several letters, so it wasn'tin fact, I brought some. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And that was very hard to sustain that. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I mean, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Anyway that's the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea around what time you would have been getting those letters and perhaps around what time you would have received the last letter from your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Gosh, I really don't remember the dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I have to look again on all of the letters, but some of them, I got rid of because when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> after I gotwhen I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with the Saturnia, I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to distant relatives who gave me the affidavit and my brother, Henry, the affidavit and gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And I lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I did teach <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> just like I had mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So it was really a blessing that my mother was wise enough to make me learn these things, and that I was able and equipped to do some of those things because not speaking a language and coming makes it very difficult, but thank God I picked it up quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Marion, you and I have agreed to go back to the time when you were about to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to live with relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , and so that you could give more detail about the circumstances of that departure under the Naxis' scrutiny and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Just before I left, we received a list of things that I was allowed to take and all of the things that I wasn't allowed to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I was allowed to have two forks, two knives, two spoons and silver, sterling silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I was allowed to take one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">feather bed</span> , which was kind of tough to pack, but my mother managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I was not allowed to take any sort of jewelry, even if there was any sentimental attachment to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I wasn't allowed to take anything else and the clothes I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I mean more clothes than just on your back, but we were allowed to take clothes, a trunkful. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Well, my aunt who was a very fine seamstress sewed a lot of my clothes before I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I had a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> , and my mother saw to it that I had enough so that I wouldn't have to spend any money in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for buying clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I had enough to last me for a couple of years, if so necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And my aunt sewed all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And they alsowell, when I left, I left with these things, but I also tookmy mother! </span><span class="sentence" id="550">had a little package with junk jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I would say it was junk. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I mean, it was just little things from childhood, and none of it valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It didn't mean anything, but 1t was sentimental to me and so I took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I figured some day I would maybe give it to my children or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And I took it along and many years later, when we werewhen we had alreadywhenafter I had gotten married and had children and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greensboro</span> and my husband, we built a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">My husband said to me before we moved in there, you know, honey, you ought to get rid of some of that stuff you've got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And we looked through this little jewelry pack and threw away a lot of the things because they were really just child's jewelry, and I really didn't need and we didn'tand then our attention drew to one particular thing in there, which was dark, dark brown, and it was like little links, with a little chain on the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Well, he looked at that and he says you know what, you ought to take that tomorrow to the jeweler and ask him if that was junk, too, because I really can't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Well, I took it the next day, and it turned out that my mother had dropped that piece into either vinegar or browned it with brown shoe polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And the jeweler told me it was 18 karat gold, solid, and it was a very lovely bracelet, which I didn't remember at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And she must have just stuck it in there and wanted to be sure that if I get stopped by the Naxisthey did go through my luggage, but they never looked in there, and if they had I wouldn't have been nervous because I would have never known because I knew nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So I came out pretty good out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Because it would have been a disaster if I had known. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I would have been so nervous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Do you know of any possibility that you might have been able to leave with a sponsored group rather than go alone as you did to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Do you remember any discussions about that with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  Never heard about that, and I never heard it being mentioned anywhere that I could get out with a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I think it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">In '39 not many people got out anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was December '39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Did your passport or visa or affidavit label you as a Jew, and if so, how?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="794">QUESTION:  You mentioned to me when we talked on the phone that it's gotten a little bit harder to do that in recent years. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And I wonder what your thinking 1s about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  Well, I think as we get older, we become more sensitive to our heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And I think about it as a parent, but I would feel like if I had to do to that to my children, you think more of your heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I think what happens is that you relate to yourself what would you do if this happened to you, and how would you be able to handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And it breaks my heart to think my parents had to go through all of that and never saw the grandchildren or anything or anything, dammit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  Marion, why don't you talk a little bit abouta little bit more about going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , specifically perhaps as a guest of the German government?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  Well, my feelings were very, very mixed because in a way I wanted to go back and I wanted to take advantage of the invitation, which was free for me and my husband, but I guess I really don't know how to explain that properly because I felt like they took so much away from me, and they could never repay me. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And whatever I could get back, and this sounds very strange to say, I would take advantage of. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And Iwe went back and thank God my husband went with me and wethe German government treated us like royalty, which made me sometimes almost nauseous because I felt like it was almost like an insult, and yet I took it for what it was worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And some of the tours they took us to were very upsetting because they took us to a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , which they wanted to move, and some of the Jewish people there wanted it to be staying the way it was, and there was a big fight about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Then they took us to an <span class="BUILDING">orthodox Jewish center</span> , which was very interesting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I had never been to anything like that before and we took partthe German government gave the dinner, but the thing was in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and they were all orthodox Jews, and I sat upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">The service was very interesting, but it was very hard for me to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">We sat upstairs, and my husband sat downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And then after the service, we had dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And onethe president of the congregation, a doctor, got up and introduced himself, and welcomed us and also mentioned something, which was shocking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">There was quite a large Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> now, and that he, himself, has done a lot of studies on Europe all over and moved back from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , living in part of that center where we were visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And he says that he feels that in his own mind that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> right now of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is the safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> for Jews to be because everything goes in a circle, and he feels like this 1s a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And those are the very words he used. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">That upset me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But otherwise the trip was very enlightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And some of the things were very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I had a chance to see my friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And that's about tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  Why don't you finish up the tape by telling me about your receiving this socalled black book from the German government that gives statistics about what happened to your parents during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">ANSWER:  When I received that book at first I couldn't believe what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I felt like 1t was the worse thing I've ever seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I mean, to write a book, and tell us of all of the Jews they killed and sent me a book with my parents' names in it, at firstmy first reaction was I was going to throw it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> , but then I took a second look at it and I thought well, I'm going to keep it for my children to see what really happened so nobody will ever forget what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I don't think it would have been printed if wasn't true, but a lot of people think it wasn't true, but 1t was all true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finish the interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  With all of these tragedies, I feel like I have still beenas much as I hated losing my parents and it was a great loss to me, I feel like I was a very lucky girl to go through life the way I didexcuse melucky to have a wonderful husband, and a second husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">My first husband died. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And I had great children, and we've had about as happy of lifeeverybody has problems, but I think we are all very fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And I think my children feel that way, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">They had a great dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And I will sign off now. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">End of File Two Conclusion of Interview </span>
