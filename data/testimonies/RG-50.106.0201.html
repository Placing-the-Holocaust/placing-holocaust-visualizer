<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Your friends were non-Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  But you know this was only a <span class="BUILDING">village school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It had only four classes for eight grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And when I finished my fifth grade, my mother felt that I was a smart girl, that I should go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So she inquired the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to our, where we were was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> , Michaela comes from and so she went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> and the principal said I have to write a little exam which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I went there to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but even so it only was 18 kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I couldn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You know there was no transportation and the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> I couldn’t do that twice a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So my mother found a family where I was boarding. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That means when I was 12 years old, I already left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But you know I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and give lectures on the Holocaust and I would tell the children that at 12 years of age, I would be already on my own and they said oh how horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I would say well it wasn’t so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I became very self-sufficient and I had to look after myself and I felt very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And well I was taught from when I was very young to be self-sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My mother would send me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when I was six years old to visit an uncle and aunt who had no children in <span class="REGION">southern Bohemia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I wasn’t afraid at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I was the whole day on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> my uncle would be waiting for me and I had absolutely no fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 know when you grow up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , it is different like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> you don’t have — well we did have burglars, they burgled our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> but I wasn’t afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">First of all there was maybe one or two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and one of them was when our doctor from the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And he came through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> like a crazy guy so you’d say go away, go away quickly because the gonzerit [ph] is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know even the chickens and the geese were running away on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You know in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pond</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And as children we would go swimming there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Nobody taught us. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We just went in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and started first with one leg down and then we just lifted the other leg and that’s how we were swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And in winter it froze over and we would be skating on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But I was, I didn’t have a really proper skate. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My mother had a pair of skates. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Can you imagine from the turn of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They were iron skates and you attached them to your shoes you know like you had a key and you had to turn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I would put them on in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and by the time I was at the <span class="DLF">pond</span> I lost them about three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But my brother, he was very good at it and he won the special skate and he told my mother you buy me, Kanotski [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And these are already good skates and they had little, like little teeth in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And as a matter of fact one day he fell into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Because we had <span class="BUILDING">inns</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">inns</span> would take the ice from the <span class="DLF">pond</span> , from the summer so that the beer would be cold in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And overnight it would freeze over and let’s say there was a little snow so you couldn’t tell where they took out the snow, the ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And one day my brother crossed the <span class="DLF">pond</span> and he fell in and we were standing in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , my mother and I. We were absolutely going crazy because you could see him going up and down and up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And then a young man came and he lie down on the ice and he rescued him but he had pneumonia and pleurisy because he was in that icy water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or among your friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You said you —
ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Because you have to understand that we didn’t have a radio because we didn’t have electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So nobody had radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My mother I think was the only person who got a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So they really didn’t know what was going on around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And with a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German speaking village</span> , the people lived there probably I don’t know 300 years, 400 years something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012
QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  German.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  So you would go visit all these relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  No they would come to visit us because we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they lived in — like five of them lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So during the summer we always had visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Was your family a Zionist family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  No, you know living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and my mother took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That was, as I said the next big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And she would take us there for Hanukah and the holidays so we would you know be able to know what it means to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And for Sukkot, we didn’t have a sukkah but we put branches in, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Of, behind all the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">This was that, so we knew it was Sukkot. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And my mother which was very unusual knew how to doven, you know she knew how to read Hebrew because at that time women really didn’t know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And to learn something about being Jewish, she engaged a rabbi from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It took him two hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to come and teach us and of course we didn’t like him very much because he was limping. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And you know children are very cruel and because he was different right. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we always were somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They had to look for us 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So he was https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 teaching us some Hebrew and he was teaching us the Sh’ma and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I knew that I was Jewish that you know —

ANSWER:  At that time you know <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was a very wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There was no difference between religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Everybody went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And it was really wonderful and the first president of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was a man by the name of Masaryk. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He was very forward looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">As a matter of fact he took his, he married an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Her name was Guise. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And he incorporated in his name, her name so his first name was Tomas and then it was Gari and then it was Masaryk. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And he was very, I mean he was a socialist but he was as far as being Jewish, there was a process. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">One Jewish man was accused of black libel and he defended this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I mean he was a fantastic man. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The only thing he was already older. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He was during the First World War he was a legionnaire and of course he was in touch with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And this is when <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> became a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1918 because before it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austro-Hungary</span> but that was many, many, many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  When did you first starting hearing about a man named Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Do you remember your first time you heard of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Well the thing is when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> , the family I lived with every Friday night we would go to another family visiting and they always were listening to the radio and the conversation always was about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , about a name named Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But where I lived there were considered Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was a man by the name of Hans Henline and he formed a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And so I knew about the Henline party. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there only were probably three people who belonged to the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And they didn’t live in — these were young people who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , university students who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they brought it, they talked about it but nobody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And so of course in 1937 I already was aware that there was a man by the name of Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  You were 12 years old then? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012

<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  OK and you were still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Yes and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during the summer and that’s when it all started, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And of course you know <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> wasn’t supposed to be occupied and, but Hitler had never — and you know they mobilized and of course people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who were German, they also were mobilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They all went to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And then October Hitler decided yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">No, that was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">In the spring of 1938 Hitler occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Right, the Anschluss.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  Well I continued going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we hoped to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But then in the fall of 1940 as I told you that Eichmann, that the Jews could leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He grants us visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So some people then got visas and went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Some, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had only had quotas so they didn’t take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And Mr. Roosevelt didn’t want us because he was running for a second term so he couldn’t use us. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And some, a few people went to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Guatemala</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quito</span> you know and <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And they would go to a priest and the priest would give them a paper that they are Catholic and that’s how they got to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And since Eichmann couldn’t get rid of https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 us so he had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to send us. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So he found this <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> in the northeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Before that he couldn’t wait that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So in October 1941 the first transports were sent, five of them, a thousand persons each to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">That was the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And then they sent a young, about 450 young men to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> to prepare the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you know to make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> had to be — because it was a, 1t was a military time and so they prepared it and then the first transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> went in December 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So then we knew that we will be moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But you know nobody had any idea what it was like, where we are going to go, what’s going to be and you know I didn’t go — the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And anyway it was a very uneasy time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  My regular clothes and I started running <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like crazy because I couldn’t wait for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> because that was too slow because I had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before 8:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Because if they would have caught me they could put me into <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And my poor uncle and aunt they were on pins and needles because it was five to eight and I still wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And so I arrived maybe one minute past eight and my poor uncle was standing already in the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">My aunt must have given orders that he should give me a, give me one you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And so they decided that they cannot take this https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 because it’s you know — and doing terrible things to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And you know I’m 14 years old or 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">You know you want to be with the young people and you don’t take these things so serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And so they asked my mother that she should find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to send me somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So my mother went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and the social services and says I have a daughter and I cannot keep her. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Perhaps you have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you could place her. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So they did place me with young women. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It was a <span class="BUILDING">women’s shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But most of them, they’re a little older and they were not of very good repute. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And they did things which I really didn’t like and I felt, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But I felt that it wasn’t the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I myself, already at that time was very self-sufficient I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I went to the social services and I told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Listen, this is not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">These girls are doing things which --

you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And these were children from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostrova</span> , where their fathers were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The Jewish fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They took all the Jewish men and they sent them into what’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And so the children were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and there was, we were in two <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , in two different <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Like a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">In one were the girls and then the other one were the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And we just got our food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But the food was hardly any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I got extremely thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And they became worried, so they found two families where I went for lunch, two lunches a week so I shouldn’t get so skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And that’s when I still went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And so then I was sent to another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You know how you are being shuttled from one <span class="NPIP">end</span> , from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And the transports were going already. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And my mother and my brother, even so, my brother lived in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and my mother lived with her sister but when the transport was called, my mother and brother went together with, in August of 42 they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="468">I knew someone a young man and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a nurse, as a nurse’s aide. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">My mother worked also as a nurse and as a matter of fact we had typhoid and she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where the children had typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And my brother he was very young then. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He was 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">He was making toys for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Wooden toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I mean not for the children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The Germans took all these things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They were — they said, took it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And you know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> 1t was again we were the young people and I was already 18, no 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And we would get together in the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We had <span class="INT_SPACE">lofts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">You know the Germans kind of didn’t know that we had these <span class="BUILDING">lofts</span> and we would get together and we would, there would be somebody who would read poetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And somebody would sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I mean it was like what young people are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And but the thing was that people started to leave you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And nobody knew where these people were going and people — oh yes, a lot of people came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and German Jews were told that they are going to be sent to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , you know like serene bath, <span class="INT_SPACE">house bath</span> you know to a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> and they were allowed to bring their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> along. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And so they arrived and they said so where is the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> where because they lied to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And there were loads of old people and they started dying out very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And we, the young ones, we kept on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We had, we did our thing even when the only thing we were afraid, that we would be sent away and nobody knew where you’re going to be sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They sent you a little piece of paper and you said they said you have to be at 8:00 at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And so my mother was one, got a little paper once. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And because she was a nurse, she was looking after people who had typhoid so they took her out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">That was what Gunda Redlich was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And then one day she, again she came to me and she said she was called up again and that was September 43 and at night came my brother to see me and he says you know what I am going voluntarily with mother because I cannot let her go by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You know my mother wasn’t that old. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">My mother was in her early 50s. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">You know that was 43. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That means she was 53 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And but he said he couldn’t let her go by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Anyway so they left and I this is the famous DM transport where I suppose you know that all of them was killed on the eighth of March 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">But my mother died, she got diarrhea and when somebody got diarrhea they died from dehydration and my mother died on the fourth of January 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And my brother who was in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">DM transport</span> , the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was called up and they were killed, all of them close to 4000 Czech Jews were killed on the eighth of March 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And so https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 we were, we were left in that — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and we were waiting when are going to be called up because you see when you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You had to sign a paper that after six months it’s going to be special treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And our six months would be up very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So we knew this is what’s going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But in the meantime the Germans sent in more prisoners from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> to day to be at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">familial camp</span> to fill it up and then what we didn’t know was the invasion of Europe, you know in 1944 when British and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> and the Canadians and so on, they started invading Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">We didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So one day, I mean, you know there were always rumors and there were rumors that there’s going to be a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">See in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was never a selection like in the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Where the men where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D camp</span> there were always selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they always took out the people who were old or sick or couldn’t work anymore and they took them out and they gassed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">That happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I don’t know how often during the week, but it happened very often.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  You had this, this tremendous will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">You had to, you wanted to show them that, that you are going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You are going to outlive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And you did everything possible to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Like staying clean helped you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And all, we were discussing all kinds of books and you know we were all very intelligent people so we were talking about Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and Schiller and Goethe and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We somehow wanted to, you know in Hebrew say Doske [ph], you know what that means. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">We are going show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">We are going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We will manage to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So anyway, so when he chose us the next day we were called, all our numbers were called out of the girls who were chosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And we were marched to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s camp</span> and when we came to the women’s camp, the orchestra was welcoming us. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They played for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">But there is a book, this girl wrote a book about her being the conductor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Yes, she was conducting there and they are playing very nicely and we were marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And they put us up in different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">But the girl who was there, they didn’t like us because we had hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">We are the only prisoners whom they didn’t shave. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So already that we were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And so they already didn’t like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They were shaven because they, most of them came 1942 from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so they were there already, this is 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So they were already there a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 And when we wanted to go for instance into the <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span> you know to get washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">There was a girl standing with the laboir [ph] and she, she let the water strike at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I mean they didn’t like us because they also knew already that we are not going to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And can you imagine they being there since 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Now it’s 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And that we are going to be shipped out and they just, they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I can understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They were jealous of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And so we were there a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I don’t know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I think it was the end of June and I think that we left a week later. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Now I have literature from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And there they write that we arrived between the 16" and 17" of July. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But I think we came there sooner than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I’m not quite sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  So you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  Yes so, so anyway so they put together, they divided us and they added to us some Hungarian girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And we were standing always in silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">They moved us around and we moved around because we wanted to be with certain girls and we didn’t want to be divided and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So there was always a big doing on and they didn’t do anything to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Anyway they divided us. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Part of us went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and part of us went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtutthof</span> [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And they added some Hungarian girls but I don’t know if ever anybody told you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Before we left we were examined internally. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Because perhaps we were hiding some gold or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So and then we got brought to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and when we were brought to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we saw that there were not only SS men but soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But first of all it was a relief that we left, we were going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because nobody in their right mind ever could fathom that that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were, again there was nowhere to sit you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Just the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But we stopped quite often because there were air raids because we drove, we didn’t know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">We drove through the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> we went all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So when we arrived at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> the next day and I do think it was my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And it wasn’t the 16" or 17". </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I believe it was my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And so we found out that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And they put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I found out just a few years ago that it used to be a <span class="BUILDING">tobacco warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Right now I have a picture of it because I told you, I got in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and they sent me pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I have pictures of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And there they write that we arrived between the 16" and 17" but I’m quite sure we came there a little earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And it was clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were only two stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Like one on upper and one lower https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 so that wasn’t — before we had three stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And they were smaller ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Only about two together and we each had our own little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And the soup was better. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I mean we were in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And but the first night the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> started to shake and we didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It was an air raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And some girls yelled to the others who were up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Don’t move. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">What are you moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">The whole thing shakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">We had no idea that the bombs are falling all around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And so we started going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">At first they put us on a shift and I mean we went to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Mostly oil companies, we were cleaning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">You know that’s what we were doing first, to clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But I remember they brought me to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my first job was to wash <span class="DLF">windows</span> and I have said to the fellow, could I have some newspaper and he said what do you need newspaper for? </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I said well to wash the <span class="DLF">windows</span> you will see. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And when I was finished they couldn’t believe it, what a good job I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And we got a little better soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And there were other people working there but we found out later on were Dutch people and French people, not they weren't -- they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And they were also working in these <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">To clean up after the air raids, but you know just to clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And the air raids were continuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">During the night and during the day like we would go in the morning and there were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> standing nicely and on the way back there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">You could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> was hanging on and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> was on the other hand hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I mean they did a real good job I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And but the British knew and the Americans knew where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">That there were a group of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">They’re not going to bomb us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  Where we stayed and even where we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And so we were there a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And I just found from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , I got this literature and it says let me tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We went to <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niue Graden</span> and we arrived there on the 13" of September and we left there on the 8" of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So we were there the whole winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">We went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">People worked all over, but my group went to work in a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> because they built little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because don’t forget the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , they had nowhere to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And so we were building little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and so I was in a group where we’re working in a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And so we each got a shovel and started shoveling the sand and we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that you know little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they put sand there. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And we had a https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 foreman who was an old German, skinny guy who was very decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And he saw that I seemed to be a good worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And it’s funny when they see that you are a good worker, they always kind of find you a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So he stopped me and he said you are going to be the switcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So I became the switcher on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and you know there was a fellow who was the driver of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I was the switcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And the driver, he was a communist and he had to go to the police, I believe every night or once a week so that he didn’t run away or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">But the air raids were unbelievable and so when the air raids were, the thing was we had to watch out where the - it was called flak. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">That anti-aircraft. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">You know it splinters, it splinters and if that caught you, you were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">So when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , when these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were empty we would turn them upside down. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">We could do that and we would hide under, yes and you could hear ping, ping, ping, you know how these things are falling on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So we were there for a while until I told you til the second, til the eighth of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And then they moved us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Oh by the way, Niue Graden it’s today a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And I had a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Her name was Ruth Pinchovsky and she, that name afterwards oh she married a fellow, Fayon and you know she was fighting with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> that they shouldn’t allow to put a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But anyway, I have a picture of the <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> , a part of the <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> and there is a tablet where it says that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">That’s what I read from. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And anyway so they moved us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiesstack</span> on the eighth of February right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  How do you spell that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  Tiesstack, T-I-E-S-S-T-A-C-K. And I was chosen to work right outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I was making big bricks with holes you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Like I had a helper. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">She was mixing the cement with a stone and then I would put it in the form and bang it down and make it so solid and then you put out this form. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">You lift it out and you had this brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But you had to work hard otherwise it would fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And then somebody came and they put it in the, it would be dried and they would make new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And it’s a strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I remember most everything but I could not tell you who was living with me in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">What it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They sent me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> a picture of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">It doesn’t say anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I remember that there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining hall</span> which was a long <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and I remember exactly where I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">But I couldn’t remember that <span class="NPIP">place</span> what it looked like or who was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Because very shortly after that one https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 day we went from work, which was around, I say you know that it was in, still in February but nobody wants to believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">We went from work and we were standing to go in and as we were standing the siren sounded and they told you that the flyers were already crossing the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and that was called a full alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And we told the guard who was a soldier and he was a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">He was a decent guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">He was kind of heavy rotund and we called him puppy and we said puppy look, there’s an air raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Can’t we go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">and he says you know I cannot let you go in because you have to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And as we were standing there it became a full alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">That meant the flyers really are already over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the bombs started to fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And it killed puppy but of course he wasn’t killed by the bomb but he was quite killed by the flak. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">The girl next to me, her name was Tuli Klasa, she was killed and I started running like crazy to the <span class="BUILDING">dining hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And to this day nobody wants to own up whose <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Do you know?

<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  That I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I am saying the things that I am saying but nobody wants to corroborate it with me that it was sometimes in end of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And they said it isn’t so but my figure I’m sure it’s so. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And when we arrived they had a <span class="DLF">block</span> there and there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> no nothing and we had to lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and it was terrible because one was lying on top of the other and when you had to go the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> you had to step one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> didn’t work and we had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">It was complete chaos there. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I mean most of the people were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">It was typhoid was —
QUESTION:  This is Bergen Belsen you’re talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  Bergen Belsen yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">It was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We hardly got anything to eat and water was, there was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">As I told you, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> didn’t -- I mean you couldn’t even go. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">You know we went around the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It was terrible because — it was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And then one day there was a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And we didn’t know the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> was full of corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And they made us drag those corpses to a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> because they wanted you know, they knew that they had to, that they‘re going to lose so they wanted to clean it up kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So we did that and when, certain hours they said enough and so we just dropped the corpse and went back and you saw like a row of corpses lying there and you know you become so not feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">You know you become so nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">You know, you know that it’s goes on, this is what you’re going to be like and you fight on. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And then the Germans ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And then they brought in Hungarian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And they didn’t give us anything to eat either. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So we went, tried to find some food and the Germans had storage. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">You know they stored potatoes and turnips and things like that under straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Like earth and straw https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 and it was like, like big <span class="DLF">graves</span> you know but a huge thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So we went there to dig it up and these damned Hungarians they started shooting and they killed girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And you know what, it’s a funny thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I’m the only one who remembers that. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">When you will read anything about Tiesstack they don’t talk that Hungarians were there, but they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Anyway and then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And then there was no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">There were just a few of us who still were able to walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And they were (sound skip) including myself and we felt that Red Cross must be coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">You know somebody must be coming so we wanted to prepare for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">We found a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Believe you me it was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And it was hard for us to carry that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">We carried it on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And as we were standing at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> somebody started shooting at us and the girl next to me was shot at but the bullet went into — she had a blouse with a, with a pad and it went into the pad, but nothing happened to her and as we were standing there a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> arrived with a white star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Who the hell knew what it was? </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You know we have no idea what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">turret</span> opened and there was this young man and he said that the division of all the allies came to liberate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">He said it in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Atdalem Aleit Mezhde [German expression — ph] he said and they started driving in and the soldiers came walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And I spoke a little English already at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And he told, the first thing he told me is that Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Because Roosevelt died on the 12" and we were liberated on the 15". </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And I like an idiot was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I never cried throughout my whole three years but I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">So now when I give a lecture, | tell the children that I am ashamed of my tears because Mr. Roosevelt could have saved thousands of Jews and he didn’t do anything so that’s why I’m ashamed of my tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Anyway so this British army came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">This was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they liberated and they saw the horror because most people were dead and there were thousands of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And they got in touch with their <span class="BUILDING">head office</span> and the first thing they did, they put up <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So at least we could get washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far from where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">armory town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Of course the German soldiers were not there anymore and that they changed into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hospital town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And they tried to take us all the sick people first so I was, you know I wasn’t sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I was walking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So you should have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">They put down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , the soldiers put down a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Before you knew there were ten naked ladies lying there because you were not allowed to take any of their clothes because it was full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 Anyway so I was one of the last ones going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And we’re coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> and there was a square and I was put up with some other girls in one of these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I don’t know how smart I got, said ’'m going to go and work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And I stole some butter and I put it in my chest and I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I wanted to bring it to the girls butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And before I came it was running down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Anyway, so then the Red Cross started coming and they had clothes for us because after all we had nothing and I got a leather jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">It was an old leather jacket, but it was a leather jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I got Eisenhower jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Yes, oh yes, but my director on our own before we were liberated, there was nobody, we couldn’t walk around and there were <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">You have no idea what the Germans had <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> full of what do you call it, attaché cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">You know these leather attaché cases that officers always used and you see films, they always had these attaché. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">A whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> full of attaché cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">A whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> full of jackets, flyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">You know for the air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Beautiful jackets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And then there was old clothes and all kinds of junk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And I found myself a pair of pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">It was they were huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So I put a, I think some kind of a just string around it because I weighed 46 pounds at that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And I’m five, eight.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  And anyway I found those pants and then I found the leather jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Not, the Red Cross didn’t give me, there I found a leather jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And so the Red Cross there and when we were liberated they tried to give us clothes and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And then the British soldiers were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> and you only were allowed to go to a movie if you had an escort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And you had to go with a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And I found myself a soldier and his name was Goldberg and he says he was Jewish and that he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , I don’t remember what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And he became my friend, kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And they said when they said if we know of any people you want to write to, you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So I raised my hand and they said you want to write to someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I have an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and they said but do you know his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I said https://collections.ushmm.org November 29, 2012 damn well I know the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And that is, 12, it’s 1448 Bishop Street Montreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And they looked like I was nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">You know how could I remember an address in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So I did write him a letter and my uncle got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">It was the first letter arrived from someone who was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I believe it was even published in a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And so my uncle knew that I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And after —
