<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Well, I have to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">The <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> had a speaker who caught Eichmann and he was the most fabulous speaker, wa -- th-the guy that looked this short, and white hair, of course it looked very different, and the judge was here and they held a [indecipherable] they -- they tel -- told the story how they caught him, which was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Eichmann was especial painful to us because he was the chief architect of the Hungarian Jews, and I think it was fabulous that after all those years they were able to catch him and bring him back and bring him to trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And March 7, 2003 he didn’t deserve a trial like he got, he got a ver -- a very, very fair trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And he should have been burning in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> for a long time for what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I don’t think that the trials are equal to the crimes at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">That’s again personal, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">You know, you -- you can’t --

<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t see how anybody can but feel very s -- deep sadness about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I think that Kennedy had the potential of bringing something very great to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in terms of inspiring young people, and -- and the fact that so many assassinations happen shows this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is very gun -- although the -- Kennedy said no, you can’t protect anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">That’s what he himself said. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">You can’t protect March 7, 2003 a president a hundred percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Nevertheless, no one has as many assassinations as we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And the role that guns play here is tremendous and it’s very fearful and it’s scary.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  I -- I stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I noticed very early that when they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they were ready to talk about certain things and at eight o’clock they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So I decided to quit my job, although they were willing to take me back to the Army Map Service cause there are so few Hungarian speaking people, on a part time basis, which at that point was in the 50’s, it wasn’t that common. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And I decided to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And my -- my oldest daughter Debbie began to draw very nicely and she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and she said, Mommy, the teacher said that the sun 1s here, th-th-the -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is here and the -- this -- the sun isn’t always on the right hand side. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I tried to tell the teacher sometimes it’s in the middle, when I’m walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Teacher didn’t believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So I decided to study art at that point because I saw that my kid had something that that teacher never learned, a methodology. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And I liked to draw when I was a kid, and ev -- everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And I took a la -- a few art courses and then I studied with Jack [indecipherable] who is a local Washington colorist. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I decided to go to st -- to teach art. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Now, March 7, 2003 at that point, art was not taught in every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they didn’t have any art teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The only way they could hire me was through resource teacher job and I- and they started me with [indecipherable], and <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they didn’t even have pencils. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I started to teach art to children that actually never even had a pencil to draw with, and they were just thrilled with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And I devised a method and I started to teach <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> through sixth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I -- I liked that age because th -- in that <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> you can do a lot with -- take them out and look at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and you show them the bark and feel the bark. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And it was just my own ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And I began to teach un -- for -- until I retired, I guess, in 1968 and was in the school system, some -- in two or three <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But in addition to that, I worked at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Louise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I don’t know if you know where that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I was the head of their craft department, but then I wanted to introduce more fine art. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And I hired more counselors who did painting and drawing and sketching and things like that for the whole summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I did that for 25 years, I enjoyed that very much and I felt that children away from parents and not near a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , were very receptive to -- to learning and self expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And Louise has 400 acres of -- of <span class="REGION">land</span> and you could go under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and just all day, spend all day just looking at the way the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> looks at different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So I was very successful doing that, and I enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And what I did is that I called every parent March 7, 2003 that I felt had a potential student, in the fall, to give them lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I made that a very strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I told the child that I will do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And since then, which was about 20 years ago, I meet kids in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and different <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they’ve said, oh you remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">There was one kid the other day that says, do you know I am one of the head designers at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomindales</span> in their interior department and it was all because of what you taught me about symmetry and asymmetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">She even remembered what I was working with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And I had -- I had a great time with kids during the summer, with art and with -- it all started with my child and art. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Now, out of my three children, they all love art and we all go to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But one of my grandchildren paints very well [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We had some of her stuff framed. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And a -- and art has worked through th -- my whole family that way and -- and we’re very happy tha -- doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And I just recently stopped because my arthritis does not permit me to paint [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But I’m in -- I’m -- my -- my next best job is the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I love to work with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your work with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  Yes, I am in the education department and our primary thing is to take children, middle and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> age, those were the first ones, through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and they are supposed to have some background, one of the teachers goes to these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and gives them a few lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">But 99 percent of them don’t even know March 7, 2003 what the word means. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The first thing I ask them is do you know what the Holocaust is, and you can see on their faces, mm -- mm -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It’s no use to go to that <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I told this at every meeting to everybody, if they don’t know the meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">If you don’t know the word, you are wasting so much time because you are talking about something so abstract, and -- and you -- you know, you have to put these kids, some of them don’t even know where Europe 1s, or -- or what is it that we’re trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We are not giving them enough basics. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But I worked on that and I succeeded partially, and I am continuing on it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">At first, as I take, and we have about 12 to a group on a good day. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">On a bad day we have 50 - 60, you define the Holocaust, you stand in the Hall of Witness and I try to teach them something about the architecture because I think it’s a very important part. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">You know, if I only spend five minutes, there has to be something said about the architecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Then we go upstairs and then I try to go over and I explain to them we don’t have time for every picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But as we walk along, if something appeals to you that I’m not stopping, just stop me and I can stop again. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">The main thing 1s that I try -- and I must confess to you that not everybody has this technique yet, to be able to get down on the level that the majority of the group is on. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">To pick that up on their eyes, because they’re too embarrassed to ask questions because they feel that theyll appear dumb, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So you have to somehow, sometimes ask March 7, 2003 questions, but sometimes the questions are a waste of time because they don’t know the answers, but somehow or other feel and see of what level you have to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And that’s what -- that’s what I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">That’s what I try to do and I think that’s what I do well. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And I -- and -- and now, a couple of months ago they started to do the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The police chief, Ramsey thought that all the police should go up, and the CIA. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I -- having a choice I like the children better. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Well, I think that sometimes the police [indecipherable] almost like entertain me. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Without the word entertain, but like teach me. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I -- I -- I know everything, kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That’s what I see on the face, you see, and it’s not always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">The children then, have a book what they can write what their opinion is or what they want, or -- and I suggest to the teachers to have them do two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Write an essay about it and also draw. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Art is a fabulous thing to draw wha -- about the things, about what they saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And the most -- most meaningful thing that was ca -- on -- in the book, was written by black girls who said that up to now I only thought that my people suffered, and I didn't want to hear about anybody else suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But going to this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it opened my eyes that there are other people who have suffered also, and I must learn about their suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And I think that if we get one percent of this through to one percent of the population, that we’ve succeeded.</span></p>
