<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, so this is basically starting with liberation, but why don't we go back a little bit before you were liberated and talk about how old you were, where you were living, that type of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  At liberation we were still living with Father Longiree(ph) and we were free to leave at that point, but he had gotten attached to us and wouldn't let us go and he also realized that we didn't really have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go back to, so we wound up staying with him for another year until 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">| was 14 at the time and eventually my father went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> by himself and found us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live and it was actually very same <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> that we had occupied at the outset of World War 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  When you were still with the priest, tell me where that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  That was in Saint Marten(ph) in <span class="REGION">French Alps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  So when you found out that it was liberation, do you remember the day that you found out or what, what activities were starting right before that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Well the liberation, the Normandy landing was of course June 6, 1944, but where we were, in <span class="REGION">southeastern France</span> , we were not liberated until the middle, August 15th, because we were liberated by Navy coming in from the Mediterranean. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And that period between Normandy landing and that time that we were actually liberated was a very difficult one because the German troops were being pushed back by the troops in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and they went on a rampage and burning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and taking hostages, so actually, that period, that interim period between the two liberations, exact, almost the most dangerous one for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We had originally found out about the Normandy landing on the BBC, but then the, when we actually liberated, in August, we just found Eva Edmands 2 [Date not labeled] Page 2 out somehow, | don't really exactly know how we found out, but we, the troops came, the French troops and told us that we were free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Free. . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">How did you feel then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Oh, | was elated and at that point, you know, we were free to move, we were no longer confined to a little <span class="INT_SPACE">boiler room</span> where we had been hidden for three years, during that worst period of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But then at this point, | need, we needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">| did not have any clothes, all the clothes that | had, | had outgrown. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And somehow, a social worker from the organization called OZSOE, which in French is called Organization enfant and it's a Jewish agency to help children and they got some clothes to me and they also arranged for me to attend a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ) and since it was too far for me to commute, they arranged to board me with a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so | stayed with the family and went to the College Technique and Moderne and it would have been about sixth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Sixth grade? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">No, ninth grade, I'm sorry, ninth grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  How many years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had you missed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Oh, the only formal schooling I've had was maybe two, two years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and maybe what would correspond to <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> , one year in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> and then this would have been ninth grade and that was it and | didn't even finish, finish that because then we had to go back to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , so really my education stopped, my formal education stopped at the ninth grade level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  So when you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , did you go into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Eva Edmands 3 [Date not labeled] Page 3
QUESTION:  All right, talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Okay, so we went...
QUESTION:  Your, now when you were boarding somewhere, your parents weren't with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  No, no, they remained up on the <span class="DLF">mountaintop</span> and | was all by myself and then sometimes I'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But! </span><span class="sentence" id="25">was very unhappy in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in boarding with strangers because | had actually never been separated from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And! </span><span class="sentence" id="27">was homesick and | was crying all the time and it just wasn't working out. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So we finally, my father had gone ahead and finally found us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , just very, very primitive and we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and when we left the priest, though, | had kind of made a vow to myself that someday | wanted the world to know what he had done forus. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And that wish didn't get fulfilled until 1987, when I, | found out about the and recommended him and finally got the designation of the the nations and a medal which was posthumously awarded, because he died in 1959, but in that way | felt that he had gotten the recognition that he deserved, but at the point, you know, in 1945, | didn't know, | just knew that | wanted people to know, but | didn't know anything about, didn't exist then. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we found that circumstances were really very bad because even though the war was over, everything was devastated, there was no coal to heat <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was very little food and so our circumstances didn't appreciably improve when we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We were not sure what to do at this point, but my parents gave me a choice, because they felt that | was still so young, just barely 14 and 15 and | had my whole life in front of me Eva Edmands 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 and | should decide whether we should remain in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or whether we should go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And | had this very romantic idea, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , by that time | had seen a couple of war movies and | just, you know, | had thought everything American was just wonderful so | said, "| want to go the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And so we had to put our name on a list and they had a quota and we had to wait until our name reached the top the list and that took two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So we actually didn't get to leave until 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In the meantime we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and | became ill because you know, lack of nourishment and you know, being run down from the war and | contracted pleurisy and | was very ill for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There were no, of course no antibiotics in those days and | was, there was not much help available and it just took me forever to recover from that illness and | had to stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for three months and then when it was over | found out | had lost the ability to walk, | was so weak my legs just wouldn't, wouldn't cooperate and my parents had to support me and | had to learn to walk all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  How about your parents, what was their health like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Not great, | mean my mother had always been in poor health and my father had a heart condition, but they kind of managed, but | was the one who, you know, who came down with this thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  How old, what were their ages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Well they would have been in their early 50's at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And so, by some miracle, | got over this very dangerous illness and then my father had found a job working for some <span class="BUILDING">movie company</span> because before the war he worked for <span class="BUILDING">MGM</span> and Eva Edmands 9) [Date not labeled] Page 5 he was writing subtitles, German subtitles for American movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And somehow, | don't know exactly who was involved, but he had gotten a contract for one year and we were actually able to go to the <span class="REGION">French Riviera</span> and live there for a year in a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And well he did whatever it was that he was supposed to do and that probably was one of the happiest years of my life, because we were living in a gorgeous <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my health improved and that was a very good time for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And we had met another couple who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they still had the numbers tattoo and they had met there and they were just a few years older, so they were friends that remained when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And then after a year we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and went through another year there and | didn't do much of anything cause couldn't figure out quite, you Know, we were going to leave anyway, there was no point in my doing anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  How old were you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Well, then | was 17, just a little over 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And then finally we got word the word that our name had reached the top of the list, the quota and we could go the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Before you talk about that, talk a little bit about how aware you were of the world at that time, | mean were you, the whole time you were in hiding, did you know that, what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had very little news from the outside world because we were just dependent on the clandestine BBC news and we really didn't know very much, but you know, we did find out after, afterward, | mean we had all newspapers and... Eva Edmands 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6
QUESTION:  Do you remember how, how you felt when you found out what had been going on during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  No, | just, you know there are, there're gaps in my memory, you know, certain things that | remember vividly and others | don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So | don't know really, what | thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">| guess, you know we're all so wrapped up in our personal problems and being ill, any kind of, you know, major things are less important probably, that they should have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  What about religion, you said your family was agnostic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  That's right, never was given any religious training and this is something that | very much regretted later on because | felt that if they had given me some type of religious training, whatever, it, it would have reinforced a sense of identity which is something that | lacked, | really didn't know who | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But as young as | was, all these years you know and even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was a very little girl, | had an awareness of the existence of God and | don't know how because nobody told me because my parents had a tendency to kind of downplay it and say oh well, you know, it's all myth. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And | knew there was a God and | kept searching for God, and...
QUESTION:  So at this time, when you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you still didn't have any real religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, nothing, | didn't, you know, | mean here we were supposedly Jewish but my parents had been so assimilated into the dominant culture in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> that they considered themselves Austrian and not really Jewish at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Asa matter of fact they were almost anti-Jewish because they had formally left the Jewish religion, you know, you can do that and it was just because they were, you know, my father considered Eva Edmands 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 himself to be an intellectual and they just did not believe in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And so | didn't know anything about the religion of my ancestors. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My grandparents weren't that observant, although probably more than my parents were, but each generation was more observant and that was the irony, that we were persecuted for a faith that we really didn't believe in. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But the Nazis didn't make such distinctions. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">| didn't know anything about Judaism, | didn't know anything about Christianity, | didn't know anything about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So, you know, we were told that our name had reached the top of the quota and we had, we have to have a sponsor on this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Somebody who, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , somebody who would make sure that you didn't go on welfare when you came here and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And my uncle and aunt on, my mother's brother and his wife had managed to escape the war and go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and my uncle was a doctor and he was doing quite well, they were settled and so they said they would sponsor us and so we were able to leave and we had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it took nine days to get over there and | remember that we were all deathly ill, | didn't eat anything for nine days, | was terribly seasick and we finally, finally landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on my, in 1948, May, 1948, | was just about 17 and a half at the time and my uncle and aunt were there at the <span class="DLF">port</span> to meet us and my aunt's first words to us were, "| didn't really want you to come." </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Because she was that kind of person, she very much, you know her, she did because her husband said, "Well this my sister and her family, we have to." </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But we were always, as far as they were concerned, the poor relations and she didn't have much respect for us and she didn't want us to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So this is how we were greeted after Holocaust and all we went through and not only Eva Edmands 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 that but they had a lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but they didn't put us, they didn't take us there, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> run by the Hius(ph), which was the Hebrew Immigrant Society, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> and so we spent our first night in the new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> with hundreds of other people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It was not a very good first impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And then, somehow, my father found us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, just a, you know, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere and that's how we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But my aunt was so afraid that, you know, we'd wind up costing her money that she got my mother and me a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and it was a real sweatshop downtown. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was some friend of hers was owning a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and, it was a <span class="BUILDING">bead factory</span> and we were made to string beads all day long, you know, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was just horrible and it was very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was May and it was very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So this, we were just kind of, is this <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We had this glorified picture and it just didn't turn out at all the way we thought it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And my mother and | didn't last very long in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We were fired because we didn't work fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And so we lasted only about two, three days and that was the end of that and then we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, it was, what in those days they call a <span class="INT_SPACE">railroad apartment</span> , on the very edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spanish Harlem</span> , on 98th, <span class="DLF">East 98th Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And they were just, you know, one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> going to another and it was very primitive, we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and we went, remember we went to <span class="BUILDING">Goodwill Industries</span> and got, just a few pieced of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and my father had a really hard time getting work. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know, he was in his 50's and he spoke English somewhat but you know, when you first come here and you're immigrant, nobody's going to hire you and he had to, for a first, | don't know how long, but he, he washed Eva Edmands 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 dishes, he did all those things, you know, just to get some money so we could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the other thing was, you know, as far as | was concerned, | did not speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And English is now my third language because | had to learn French first, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And so | didn't speak a word of English and yet | knew that it was very important for me to learn if | was ever going to get some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And! </span><span class="sentence" id="89">wound up really supporting the family, but | guess | have a, you know, it's easy for me to learn languages and | did learn pretty quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So it wasn't that big a problem for me to, to learn a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then things got kind of bad because my mother became very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She was only in her 50's and she had a stroke, which left her permanently disabled. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She had contracted TB during World War 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then from that she got a rheumatic heart, so her heart was not very good and she was just a tiny little woman, she was five feet and the most she ever weighed in her life was 90 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And she had the stroke and so she was almost unable to, one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was paralyzed and she had trouble walking, so she was more or less homebound after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  What about medical care?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Well she had a, we went to a doctor that we had known in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but they didn't have things for people like, you know, as they do now . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You know, there was no talk of physical rehabilitation, any of those things, we didn't have the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">| mean we would just, basically people. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We never did go on welfare but we had no money, we couldn't afford any of those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Was she hospitalized? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Eva Edmands 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10
ANSWER:  Briefly and then she was just sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she managed as well as she could athome. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And of course you know we had to, couldn't leave her, we had to take care of her, take turns. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So that was, that was kind of really unfortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She was really young and she, she really never had a life after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Was she aware of what was going on around her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, | mean her mind was never affected, her speech was not affected, her mind, she died at 83 and her mind was clear as a bell, right to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And she was never one to feel sorry for herself, she always, you know, managed to ___ herself and you know, keep herself neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And she had interests, she read, she listened to the radio and she had a lot of friends, so she was very remarkable that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But her life was just taken away from her basically, at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So really my father was still having a lot of problems getting work and it was up to me to support the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And soon as | learned English, then | started, you know, getting, looking at the classifieds in the paper and | don't know why, to this day | don't know why, but | answered an ad for somebody who wanted a bookkeeper and I'd never done any bookkeeping and math was my worst subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But | went and it was a company called Home Craftsman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was a magazine for hobbyists, people who like to putter around, do jigsaws at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and do all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And for some inexplicable reason | was hired, but after a few days they realized that | was not a bookkeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the boss said to me, | don't know what you did, you know, in your and of course | had fudged, it was a matter of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">| didn't like having to do that but it was a matter of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">| had to pretend that | had experience because | had Eva Edmands 11 [Date not labeled] Page 11 to start somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And somehow, | don't know if he felt sorry for me or what but they realized that, you know, | had not quite told the truth, but they kept me and they made me into a mail clerk and so for five years | opened mail, because they had a mail order business and I, and | just separated the orders in neat piles and count the money and the checks at the end of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And so |! </span><span class="sentence" id="121">wound up staying with that company for, for five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  And where were you living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  We were still living in, really a tenement on <span class="DLF">East 98th Street</span> , we still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  And so how would you commute?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Subway</span> , take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Were you making friends at this time?</span></p>

QUESTION:  And they still never, did they know at the time that you had no degrees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  But it wasn't an issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">ANSWER:  It wasn't an issue because all they cared about, since they were a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , they didn't have to, you know, there was no certification and they knew | was qualified, probably better than some people who did have degrees and that's all they cared about, that | could do the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And |! </span><span class="sentence" id="406">wound up staying there for 10 years, in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Just, again, just doing the same thing, working with emotionally disturbed kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And we were able then to get, with two salaries coming in, steady work coming in, we were able to get a better <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , to a very nice <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the <span class="DLF">Grand Concourse</span> , which was really a step. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Even though it wasn't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , we could not have afforded the rents for a decent <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and at the time, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> was still pretty nice and we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">two bedroom apartment</span> , my mother had her own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and her own <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and it was, it was, it was a nice and we were comfortable there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So that's how things went on, my husband working at the welfare department. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Sometimes it was, it was Eva Edmands 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 dangerous work because he'd sometimes, he'd be called away at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And | was, | was, | was worried about him a lot of times, that wno knows what might happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And then in, so this went all through the, nothing really, you know, special happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We were able to make a couple trips together back to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Yes, well | wanted, it was very important for me to show my husband all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where | had lived during the war and so we wound up really retracing all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And | had remained friends and in correspondence all these years with a man and his wife who were the school teacher in the little one room school house in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Marten(ph</span> ) on top of the <span class="DLF">mountaintop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And he was just 10 years older than | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And meanwhile they had moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ) and so we had been in correspondence and my husband and | looked them up and we stayed with them and were received very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Of course the priest had died by then and we met the new priest, who really didn't know that much about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and my cousin, my, my husband met my cousin and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> where | just had a couple friends, no relatives and we went down to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> and we went where we never did go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we, we stayed during the war, we just, it was, we had picked the wrong time of year and it was so death, really hot, that we just couldn't take the heat and so that's one <span class="NPIP">place</span> we didn't go to but we traced all the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> | had lived and it was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">| couldn't go back to the Eva Edmands 34 [Date not labeled] Page 34 Philippines to see where he had lived but at least he could see where | had lived, so that, that kind of helped.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Well he was, he was going steadily downhill because | think retiring was really the worst thing that could have happened because now he had, he had no interest Eva Edmands 46 [Date not labeled] Page 46 outside of his books. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">| encouraged him to volunteer, to maybe teach or, just on a volunteer basis or get just his mind busy and he wouldn't do this, he just absolutely sunk into his alcoholic stupor and his health started deteriorating, his liver was going and then he was showing early signs of dementia. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So it was a very, very difficult time and | had to you know, cope with the whole thing, cause he was totally, | had to take over all the finances, all the managing the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He had been driving when we first came here and then | realized that he couldn't drive any more, it was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But | didn't drive because we never had to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and so at age 56, | had to take driving lessons and passed and got my license and started driving, which was, you know, it took a lot of courage for me to do this because | was really scared, but something strange happened when | left the <span class="BUILDING">Med Center</span> in 1986. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">First of all | decided, | don't Know what happened actually, something happened there, but all my priorities changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">All the things that had seemed so important to me before, you know, exterior things, appearance, whatever, what people thought of me, this didn't matter any more, it was a total reversal of priorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">All | thought was what really mattered now was to make my life count for something, cause | didn't know at that point, you know, how much time | had left, but | decided that | would conquer my inner demons my own way and | would be successful at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And so | wrote some rules for myself and | even pasted it on the mirror in my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and it said, whatever these difficult tasks that | had to do, I'll say, | can do it, | must do it, | will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And this helped me enormously when | had to take driving lessons, | was scared stiff and | had to pass the test, but | did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Eva Edmands 47 [Date not labeled] Page 47 Then, when we first, when | first came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in '86 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , | suddenly found that | had acquired a fear of going, agoraphobia, fear of going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because probably because | had been cooped up in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> for so long and | had this absolute fear of going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and, even you know, just in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and if my husband was still driving at that time and we'd go to a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> and | would cling to him and | would beg him not to leave me because | would be absolutely panic stricken, so this was this lingering thing, but it was a new thing which | never had before, which | had to conquer. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So | decided that | wasn't going to be, you know, home bound and because of this and so | decided | would go down, because we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , | would go downstairs and | would set a goal, | would walk as far as the <span class="DLF">street</span> and then boy if | could do that, that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Then the next day | set a goal that was a little farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And so little by little, over a period of some weeks, | got to the point where | could walk to a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> , which was about a half a mile each way, to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when | could do that, then | Knew I'd gotten over my phobia and | would be fine, but...
QUESTION:  Did your husband realize how you were improving yourself so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  | don't think so, because what, what happens with alcoholics, that they're totally self-centered. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">This is not criticism, you know, it's not a criticism, but he was so wrapped up in his world that he, he could not realize what was going on, he just couldn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  So you were completely alone in this? </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Eva Edmands 48 [Date not labeled] Page 48
ANSWER:  Completely alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And so that's why | knew that, who, he, to whom | always looked to in the beginning, you know, in the early years he was my rock and my security and | suddenly realized that | couldn't count on him for support for anything and that | was really on my own and | had to do everything on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And it was, | guess in a way, | had to take over the finance as | said and | guess in a way it was a good thing because when he died, | was just totally, you know, at a lost, know what to do, | mean | had prepared myself psychologically for this event, cause the doctor had told me at one point he had six months to live because his liver's going and exactly six months later he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But well, you know, this was in 1993, he died, he was 69 years old, but in the meantime, | decided that you know, | had to do something with my life, | wasn't just going to, | was never one that could just sit <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and do nothing and so first | went and signed up to teach reading in an adult literacy course to people, adults who couldn't read and | did that for awhile and then | went to the <span class="BUILDING">public library</span> and volunteered my services here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , cause | told them | had worked at the <span class="BUILDING">University Library</span> and so | would be volunteering there once a week and then | thought | should put my language knowledge to some use and so | went to the <span class="BUILDING">senior center</span> and they didn't have any language classes and | told them that | taught French and German and offered to teach classes and they were very glad to have somebody there who could do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And so over the years | built up a, you know, a membership and it's been going since, oh 1987, we have two classes that meet regularly at the, French classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">| had German classes on and off, but they didn't take off as well as the French classes, but all told | had about 15 people Eva Edmands 49 [Date not labeled] Page 49 and they'll be <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , retired University professors from all, people really from all walks of life, but it's been, this has been my salvation, to, to have this and to get back into teaching again, which is what | really liked best of all, of all the jobs I've had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  You think you would have studied teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  Yeah, | mean, if | had been able to, the other thing | always regretted, | wanted to be a librarian, but of course you know, college degree, going to <span class="BUILDING">library school</span> , it's all these dreams that | could never fulfill. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But that, yeah | probably would have gone quite a way if |, if I'd had the opportunity for the education, but in this way | felt | could make a contribution to the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And then...
QUESTION:  And your husband was still alive during those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And then, we joined a local Unitarian fellowship here. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And my husband went for awhile, but not very long, he got tired of that and he wouldn't go and | went by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Made some friends there and slowly | started telling them about my background again, you know, during the Holocaust and | was a little leery because, in the midwest, you know, | always, you had this feeling, misconception that people are narrow minded and you know, you know, | was still afraid of rejection and discrimination but | found that people were so interested because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , Holocaust survivors are a dime a dozen, but here really, they don't have this access and | found out that they were very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And so this encouraged me and so at the fellowship on Sunday, they have programs on Sunday mornings, they have outside speakers and speakers from their own group and so they encouraged me to give atalk. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And this is the very first time that | talked publicly about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Eva Edmands 50 [Date not labeled] Page 50 And it was a great success and of course | was very nervous, I've never done, and there's another thing that | had. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">| had of course, terrible stage fright all my life, even just on the, in very small groups, if | had to get up in a group of four people and make a brief announcement, | was just, my knee turned to jelly and so | thought, oh, you know, how can | face all these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then again, | put this thing to work and | said, | have to do it and I'm going to conquer this and | made up my mind | wasn't going to be afraid and then | wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And from the first talk after that, | could go up there and it wouldn't matter whether there were 500 people, 100, | was not scared any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And some people heard me, local teachers and they ask me to speak to their students and so | built up a reputation, it was all word of mouth and at times | myself went out and contacted different groups, primarily church groups and other organizations and little by little, you know, | acquired a reputation as a Holocaust speaker and now I've been doing this since basically 1987 and to date I've kept a log but | haven't really added it up but at last count, which was last year, I'd given over 130 talks. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And now | concentrate primarily on children from grades six to 12 and I'm, you know, a registered speaker with the, our local school system, | go to all the <span class="BUILDING">secondary schools</span> and | also get calls from vicinities outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , you know, in the state of Kansas. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And | have, | have written the book that | had written during the war, which is translated into English, | had given to every, copies to every <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , so that the kids can access it in the <span class="BUILDING">public library</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And so this, during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, I'm very busy, going from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and giving talks. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Eva Edmands 51 [Date not labeled] Page 51
QUESTION:  The book, you said this book that you wrote?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Mm-hm?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  This is about your war experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  This is about, it's called Childhood Memoirs of World War 2, and as | said, it's from a diary | kept as a child when | was 14 and eventually translated to English so that my husband and my friend here could read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And | have found that, of course I've gotten other invitations from civic groups, church groups, just a variety of groups and I've always been amazed how great the desire for knowledge is, cause people really know very little about what happened during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And how warmly | am received and | have hundreds and hundreds of letters from school children, handwritten little notes to say how much they appreciated my talking and it's been my raison d'étre. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">\It's been a catharsis for me and | have, you know, my speech totally memorized, never refer to notes, | have visuals, | collect things out of the paper, anything having to do with the Holocaust and | keep adding to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And so | feel that, you know, because before | was ashamed to speak and now I'm, I'm kind of, you know, making up for that and | always tell people when | give the talks that there are some reasons why | do this, because sometimes people say, you know, "Why do you do this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And why you put, they think it's really difficult for me and emotional and | said, "Well, in the beginning it was, but after awhile you manage to get a certain distance, emotional distance from your subject, because if | were emotionally, you know, involved, every time | give a talk, | couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And so I've had to learn to disassociate myself as though it were really not my story, it's the only way I, | can do Eva Edmands 52 [Date not labeled] Page 52 it. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And | found out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the war is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self- preservation thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So | tell them there are three reasons why | give this talk, is, one is to keep alive the memory of the six million victims of Hitler, including my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And two is to counter the, the revisionist lies of people who would say that, you know, there was no Holocaust, oh it was exaggerated, it wasn't as bad and then third is so it wouldn't ever happen again and in the end | ask the kids, | said, "| need your help in keeping the story alive, because we are called the last witnesses and my fear is that once, once we're gone, my generation, there won't be anyone left to keep the story alive, so I'm counting on you." </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And, and you know, I've gotten these darling little letters, they said, "Don't worry Mrs. Edmands, we won't ever forget you, what you said," and you know, it was very, very, very gratifying and I've never encountered any hostility, I've talked to all different kinds of groups and they've always been most friendly, there's never any hostile comments or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But the one wonderful experience | had, well one good experience was in 1990, when Father Longiree(ph), the priest who had really hidden us and saved our lives had been awarded the Medal of the Just, from Yahdvashem(ph) and then organizers in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ), which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> closest to where his <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> was, decided to have a commemorative ceremony for him and from some other priests who had helped people like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And | was invited to the ceremonies, which were held in 1990, in May 1990 and | stayed with my friend there and it was just a wonderful, wonderful ceremony, they had dignitaries from Yahdvashem(ph), from Eva Edmands 53 [Date not labeled] Page 53 Israel they had the Grand Rabbi of the <span class="REGION">region</span> , they had priests and ministers and people from the French government and some 600 invited guests and | was able to again tell, talk, tell these people, in French this time, about the priest and what he had done for us and then since he had died, his medal was awarded to him posthumously and it was given to me and | asked that the medal be put in a glass case and put in his former <span class="BUILDING">church</span> so that everybody would, would see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So this was one of the high points. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And then | found out about other priests and their heroic deeds and all the wonderful things they had done, so | came back with a whole collection of stories of just, you know, sheer heroism and what | was pointing out is, the heroes during World War 2 were not the generals, you know, and who won the war, like MacArthur and so on, because that was their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was the little people, the little people were the true heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And you, you met, you know, instances of altruism which you would never think possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">People risking their lives and their families lives to help strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">At the risk of their own lives, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So that was, that was just a unique experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Then a year later, in 1991, | found out that there was a new organization formed called, for people who had been hidden as children during World War 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Now there already have been organizations for Holocaust survivors and they've had regular meetings but they're mostly for people who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And we were a breed apart, and you know, and somebody finally recognized that, because and we were sort of a little bit disparaged by the people who'd been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they say, "Oh well, you know, you didn't go through what we did." </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And that's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">But, on the other hand, we had a very unique problems as Eva Edmands 54 [Date not labeled] Page 54 children being hidden, having to live day after day with the terror of being discovered, being separated from your loved ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It was situation all by itself and it deserved some recognition. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So the Hidden Children was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">They had the first international reunion of Hidden Children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Marriott Hotel</span> in 1991, three day and they had workshops and sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And they had originally expected some 500 people and 1600 showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">From all, literally all parts of . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">People came from <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Great Britain, just all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And in addition to the former hidden children, they also had rescuers who came and for some, some were very, very elderly, some were on crutches or in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchairs</span> and for some it was their very first reunion with the, the children that they had rescued, so it was very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And | had, you know, | wanted to go, but | had mixed feelings about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">| thought | knew all there was to know about the Holocaust, | said, oh well, you Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And |, | was afraid in a way, stirring up all those memories, cause | said okay | talk about it, that's fine, but emotionally I'm detached, why stir up this? </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But in the end, | went and | was so glad | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Because the minute | walked in there, | suddenly, you know, here, | who had never been raised Jewish and now all these people, all Jewish and that was such a bond, there's just immediate bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You felt that all these people, after just a few hours, that they were your brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was the most wonderful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">A lot of them were my age, some were older. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">The age ranged from 50's to you know, /O0's and 80's. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">First woman | met there was a woman, | mean she was a prototype of an Aryan, she was blonde hair, blue eyes, porcelain skin, Jewish, had Eva Edmands 95 [Date not labeled] Page 55 been abandoned, not really abandoned, but left by her mother in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when she was two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Her mother had dropped her on <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> to save her and her mother didn't make it and she was raised by gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And so she and | met and she was very, she still had a lot of bitterness towards, you know, the Germans and cause she had then somehow found, an uncle found her and she'd found her true roots and she moved to <span class="REGION">Arizona</span> , married a Jewish man, now she's very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But she was very, she had a lot of bitterness about, you know, German people and, and really not knowing that much about her background cause she was so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But you know, there were just million stories there and we had some very inspirational speakers, we had Elie Wiesel(ph) and Serge Klaufeld(ph), the famous French Nazi hunter there. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And then we had workshops, workshops and we had a list of things we could choose, for instance, the issue of guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">People who felt guilty, as | did and then there were workshops for people who didn't know who they were, whether they were Christian or Jewish because they had been raised by Christians and they had this kind of schizophrenic attitude to weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So | went to several of workshops and | was listening to the people talking and then | thought, this can't be, they're telling my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And in so many instances the stories they told were so similar to mine, they were rescued by a priest, you know . [</span><span class="sentence" id="658">mean it was almost like they'd taken pages out of my book, | could not believe this, it was, it was spooky, you know, it was really spooky.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Yeah, a little bit, you know, you could only do it very peripherally but there were others who had come to this thing, same thing, who had been hospitalized and there were some who were still in treatment, they had been in treatment for the last 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And still going to psychiatrists and still trying to resolve these issues and | felt a lot more fortunate, you know, that | had been able, cause some people, | think they use it as a crutch and they don't move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">There were people who, who kept living in the past, that's, you know, that's the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And | determined that that didn't do any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">The past is past, now is now and you have to make your life count. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">You can't, you know, what if and the same thing that, is business of bitterness, you know, profound bitterness, | can never forgive the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Well | heard something very interesting, at the, when we went to commemorative ceremony priest about this business of not being able to forgive and said, "It is not up to the living to forgive, only the dead can forgive and they can't, you know and they're dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But it's not up to us to either, you know, hate or forgive and | do not have any bitterness to anyone, because bitterness and hate, in this context is a self-destructive emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">It really doesn't hurt anyone else, doesn't hurt the Nazis, it only hurts yourself, it can destroy you. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And | realized that | couldn't let that destroy me and that love was a much more powerful emotion than hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You know, that love could accomplish things that hate couldn't and so therefore | have no bitterness in my heart Eva Edmands 59 [Date not labeled] Page 59 toward anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Not even to the people who killed my grandparents because it's, it's not a concrete thing, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  The years that you were really growing and prospering and | take it your husband was really falling apart, was he aware of what was happening with you, of how much you were growing and getting better? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">| know | asked you that before, you said that, from the time that he started getting really sick, was he able to comprehend that you were actually finally coming out of this <span class="NPIP">hell</span> that you were in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  Just maybe on one level, but only on one very elementary level. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He was proud of what | was doing, yes, he was always proud and he always encouraged me, but on the other hand, he resented my being away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">You know, he felt | should be there with him all the time, night and day. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And he came to resent, he was really of two minds about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">In one way he was proud of me and the other one he resented my success. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Because he always regarded himself as a failure, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He had this terrible inferiority complex. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">| don't know why, cause he was a brilliant man. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But that's part of the syndrome, so as | say, he was always of two minds about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  When, when you look back at this now and you look back at the time that your, when your mom died, can you kind of piece together, has it been long enough so that you can piece together what happened to you exactly, that her loss really kind of triggered all this stuff? </span><span class="sentence" id="711">https://collections.ushmm.org Eva Edmands 60 [Date not labeled] Page 60
ANSWER:  Yeah, | think it triggered it because | really had no one to talk to but her and when she was gone, | had no one to express my feelings of frustration and fear and anger and resentment that | had bottled up inside of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  She was your best friend...
ANSWER:  She was my best friend and she was very understanding, | could talk to her about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So, and | know she was suffering a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Eva Edmands 61 [Date not labeled] Page 61 Tape 3
ANSWER:  It was, she was suffering a lot because she saw how, you know, my husband's alcoholism was destroying the marriage and destroying us. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And so when she was gone, it's though as somebody just pulled the rug out from under me, | had lost every support that I've ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  Talk about your life now. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Now, now that you're, you have friends, you have a full life. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">When did you move into your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  | moved into my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> three years ago and it was the very first time that | had ever owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we had always lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and it was a lifelong dream to own something that was really mine and to have a little <span class="DLF">garden</span> and to grow stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">| feel blessed in so many ways, cause |, | can truly say, | don't have, you know, that much money, | have a small pension to live on, but | can pay my mortgage and | can pay my bills and | feel blessed because | have everything now that | have ever wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">| have peace of mind and | don't really have any worries, | take care of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">My husband died in 1993 as | said and that was, that was a hard blow, but it wasn't unexpected because he had been so ill and he was just absolutely determined to kill himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">He had, he did have a death wish, which for reasons that, you know, | will never know and he was just absolutely determined to do away with himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And, and | figure, well he finally got his wish and then, but | realized that life had to go one and so going on with my life and buying the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, was the first step and | had already quite a circle of friends too, my volunteer work and to other organizations, so | just really kept doing what, what | was doing before, only now | Eva Edmands 62 [Date not labeled] Page 62 didn't feel guilty about it for being away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And during the school year as | said, | give talks and | still volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">public library</span> and otherwise | keep busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">There's always housework to be done, garden work. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">| go, | take walks, | read a lot, I'm trying to learn more about history, especially during the pre-Nazi period to find out what happened, that what were the circumstances that led to the rise of Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">| have a lot of, lot of different interests, I've interest in linguistics and history, geology, so many different things, that I'll probably never be able in a lifetime to satisfy them all, but I'm fortunate that | have a nice <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and it keeps me busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And | try, you know, | take some trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And, oh, one of the main things that | wanted to relate is | had a very unusual experience last year in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">| had, during the war, after we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , in 1940 or so, we wound up in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kalvisol(ph</span> ) and there we stayed for a year when my father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> there and then, this was at the time, the free zone, the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> being occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And then when the Germans broke their pact with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to, to leave part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> free and occupied the <span class="REGION">southern zone</span> , my father's life was again in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And so due to a local partisan pastor, who was also the town doctor, we were able to get away cause he had made a certificate saying my father had a dangerous illness and couldn't be moved and he also arranged for my family to get fake ID's that enabled us, with fake names that enabled us to finally leave this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the rest is recorded, you know, what followed after that is recorded in the original video | made for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But we had never, none of us had ever gone back, except for my father, he made a trip Eva Edmands 63 [Date not labeled] Page 63 back to that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and among other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , somewhere in the, you know, | don't know, 60's or so, I'm not sure, early 70's, but he went on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And he did see this pastor and his wife and then this pastor died at age 90 in 1974. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So |, for my part, had lost all contact with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And then a strange thing happened, | had given a copy of my book to the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The Archbishop wanted a copy because you know, it was about a priest and so on and then the organizers of the commemorative ceremony for the priest, with whom | had become very good friends and we'd been corresponding and they had come and visit us here, SO we were really good friends by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And they had lent my book to a friend of theirs who was a priest and of course, he knew Father Longiree(ph), but then, when he came to the chapter that dealt with the one year that we spent in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Kavisol(ph) rang a bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He said, "Oh, | know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , | know somebody who lives there." </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And you know, it was such a coincidence because of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> it could have been, this particular one he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And it was just a tiny hamlet. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And what happened, this man named Marcel Coulier(ph), was a young man during the war and he was hiding from, he didn't want, all young Frenchmen have to do forced labor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and those who didn't want to do that went underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And this priest that helped this young man hide, and they had stayed in contact and then many, many years later, you know this man had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , gotten married and then in his retirement he came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kalvisol(ph</span> ) and where he was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And so this priest copied my chapter that dealt with our lives in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> and send it to his friends, hey look you know, this Eva Edmands 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 talks about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And of course then, oh this is just extraordinary cause this friend shared it with, he had made some very good friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he shared it with all them. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And they were just so thrilled, because not only here's somebody had written about their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , so long ago and they said everything was accurate, the names, everything was accurate in every detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And of course they didn't know that their pastor had done all this cause he wasn't one to, to brag about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So they were terribly excited and they got in contact with me and we started correspondence and we talked on the phone and it just so happened that just at the time when they discovered my existence in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they were planning a ceremony for the pastor because there was a new part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was <span class="DLF">street</span> that needed a name and so they decided to name the <span class="DLF">street</span> after this pastor, so everything was in place and then they found out about me and what this pastor had done, which they didn't even know, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They just named the <span class="DLF">street</span> because he was a good man and as doctor he had brought many of them to life, so they want to honor him, but they had no idea what he done during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So then of course they wanted me to come to the ceremony and there was just too short notice, you Know, amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">| said | can't, you know, | just can't pick up and go in April, in the middle of my busiest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So | said, well | tell you what, they said, "Well could you write something and we could read?" </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So | said I'd do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So | wrote a little soeech in French and mailed it to them and it was read at the ceremony and they had other dignitaries and of course they told the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The newspaper picked it up and it was such a big deal and they send me the articles and it was almost comical because it said, Eva Edmands 65 [Date not labeled] Page 65 "Jewish girl, former resident of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavisol(ph</span> )," you know, "found living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So you know, | was like, ha, it was so funny, it was the biggest thing that ever happened to them, in that of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And so, and | was in contact basically with this one man who had been the organizer of the family and there were three families that were friends besides Marcel Coulier(ph) and his wife and then two other couples and they were, they had form an organization as the friends of Dr. Bonet(ph), which is the name of this pastor priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So all my correspondence was with them and we just became really good friends and then | started remembering names of people I'd gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And | wrote it to them and he said, "Yeah that's true and they remember you." </span><span class="sentence" id="762">You know, things started coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And then those darling people made a video tape, not only of the ceremony, where | could just watch myself where they, while they read the speech I'd written, but they made a videotape of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and sort of going around and saying, this is <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you went to and this is that abandoned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you lived in, it's always just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">But then of course they kept putting the pressure on me, they wanted to meet me and | had to promise them that | would come, you know and visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And the following year | finally decided okay, it's now or nothing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And | mean, they were so nice, you know, in letters so cordial, but | didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">You know, you go to a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you don't know anybody, | felt a little bit, but | said, "This is something | have to do.". </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Because | felt that | had honored the priest but there was still a page that had to be written in this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">It's closure, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So then | turned out that my friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ), knew this other couple, the Eva Edmands 66 [Date not labeled] Page 66 Couliers(ph), they had become friends and so my friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ) said, "If you come, come stay with us and then we will take you by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Cause otherwise | said, you know, "How am | going to get there, it's like in the middle of nowhere." </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And so that's what | wound up doing and originally | just was planning when | planned my trip, | planned, you know, two or three days because | said, "I don't Know these people." </span><span class="sentence" id="773">| didn't even know where | was going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And then when | wrote my dates, they said, "Oh, this will never do, this'll never do, you're going to have to stay with us for a week at least, cause we have all these plans." </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And you know, you have, so | had to change all my flights, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Finally went to Antsee(ph) and then they drove me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">| come there and the three family met me and | mean, | mean, | felt like a rock star. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">| mean, it was just the most wonderful welcome and it turned out that of the three couples, | Knew the husband and wife cause I'd gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And then of course they called in the media, they had a reporter from a local paper come and interview me and they had more articles in the paper and | mean, this was big deal and they took me around and the next day to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to show me all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I'd grown up and they were so thrilled, | mean they took more pleasure and maybe even more than | did, but it was weird for me to see it, abandoned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my family had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And you know, it all looked really, basically, | mean it was upgraded, but you know, all these memories keep coming back, but they were not bad memories, you know, even though they were bad times, but it was just so good and to see the people that were so wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And then they had, when | first and | stayed with one of the couples Eva Edmands 67 [Date not labeled] Page 67 and my goodness, | had a whole, practically a whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to myself, my own <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , they were pretty well off, you Know it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And then the first day | was there he pulled out a long list of things and complete, complete schedule, itinerary. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Every day, every hour planned, what they were going to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And they had realized that when | lived there during the war, you know, | didn't have time, | mean there was no time to go sightseeing and there are a lot of beautiful things, so they determined they're going to take me to the <span class="DLF">seashore</span> , they're going to take me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , you know, the whole bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So in one week we were constantly on the way, we got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> in the morning, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night and just went all around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and | saw all these things | just had heard about and they were just, | mean of course, | was totally their guest, never pay a cent for anything and | got charming gifts, | couldn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">gift shop</span> they want to buy me everything in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was, it was so wonderful and then they had organized two ceremonies, one was at the little, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my father had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">There was an official reception at <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , | was received by the mayor, speeches, you know, the whole bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And then there was another ceremonies, very similar one, in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Again with the mayor, the City Council, the whole bit, you know, the people coming up to me and | got a medal. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And | gota plaque and flowers and oh! </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And | kept saying to them, | don't know why they're doing all this, | didn't do anything to deserve this, all | did was live there for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And they said, "Oh, but you don't understand." </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And then you know, sort of talking to people later, it came to me that it was more about them than it was about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">It Eva Edmands 68 [Date not labeled] Page 68 made them feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">It showed them that there had been good people in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because you see, anyone of them, they knew we were living there, anyone of them could have denounced us and nobody talked, which is remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Nobody talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And | guess that made them feel good and it made them and some of them were too young to even remember the war and they learned something and they actually met somebody, you know, who had lived among them and it was just a great experience for them and forme. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So it was just probably the most, the best experience of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  That's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Do you have future plans? </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Anything happening that you want to, that you can talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">What do you want to do, | mean you're still relatively young, what do you want to do with your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  No, | don't because | have learned not to plan ahead to far. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">| just take each day as it comes and | don't really plan that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">| don't, | don't have any, any immediate plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">What | hope to do is that, | got a letter, last year, from the Austrian government saying that after all these years they're recognizing that they did us alla big, great wrong and they were going to make financial restitution just for the fact that, you know, we were forced to leave a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and | was deprived an education and so on and so they finally, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has done this a long time ago, but <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> 's been dragging their feet and there's supposed to be a lump sum given to people like me, not enormous you know, under 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But first they're getting the very old people, people in their 80's and their 70's, so my turn probably won't come for a year or two and | thought, well, if that were the case, I'd like to just kind of go back to Eva Edmands 69 [Date not labeled] Page 69 <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and just stay there for a month or two months, you know and just, instead of going back and forth and really, you know, just stay there, because | do love <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , it's a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but | couldn't do this unless | had this, so this is really the only plan | have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  What about plans with dating, meeting other men, is that something you ever even think about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">No, | have, you know, | have absolutely no interest in meeting men. _</span><span class="sentence" id="811">| feel well, okay, | mean my husband and | had a good marriage except for his alcoholism. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">| just felt that | could never meet anybody with whom | was as well suited as | was with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And to me that's not really important because any, | know that any man | would meet would be at least my age or older and | think it's a matter of self- preservation that | don't want to deal with somebody, getting attached to somebody and that person getting sick and dying, you know. _</span><span class="sentence" id="814">| finally at the point where | really only have to worry about myself and | don't want to get emotionally involved with anyone else, ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  But you feel that you have friends that are like a family to you?</span></p>

possible and this, you know, after all | have to realize | grew up, so to speak, you know, my late teens and early 20's is during the 50's and that is the period which is now idealized almost in movies and so on, you know, where people could still have Eva Edmands 76 [Date not labeled] Page 76 their own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and live better than their parents did, it was...[end of side 1 of tape 3]...the political picture was just totally different because the economy was on the upswing and you know, take myself as just an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">As

you know, we had, what | consider leaders, people that were figures, you know, Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Roosevelt was so loved in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , | remember right after the war, | was in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span> ) and teacher came in, tears streaming down her face and said,

we got our first papers and then we had to wait five years to be American citizens and we really, you know, first opportunity, we became citizens and | remember we had this mass ceremony in <span class="BUILDING">Yankee Stadium</span> and it was just a wonderful experience, we felt so proud to be Americans and the first time | was able to vote, | voted and | registered democrat and I've been really a lifelong democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">| worked on Adlai Stevenson's campaign, but it was | couldn't vote then cause | wasn't citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">But as | got involved early on, | was married to somebody who was really very liberal, hated the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> , hated direction our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was going and | think | absorbed some of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And today really, I'm, I'm awfully proud to be an American, | even Eva Edmands 77 [Date not labeled] Page 77 wrote a letter to the editor which was published, saying that |, I'm distressed at the seeming decline in patriotism, it used to be on the Fourth of July everybody would have a flag out. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Now you know, you can go to entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> , not ever see a single flag and | always, you know, to me it's such a wonderful privilege to be able to put my flag out on a holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And another one is people, you know, don't bother to vote, there's a certain amount of apathy and for me, it is, after having lived under a dictatorship for so long, it's a great privilege for me to be able to participate in the democratic process. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And | also have a great debt of gratitude to the, to the heroic Americans who died, fought and died so that people like me could be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I'll never

class="COUNTRY">America</span> with all my heart and soul because | felt that it gave us a chance to start our lives afresh and it welcomed us when no other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> would really do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And, you know, | can never forget this and so when | do give talks in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , | tell the kids how important their American citizenship is and why they should always cherish it, protect it and defend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Cause that's really, truly, you know | thought, this sounds corny nowadays, but this is really how | feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">You have no idea, it's still, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> has a lot of faults, but it's still, | think, the greatest <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world and when you have lived, you know, under those terrible dictatorships, you really get to appreciate it, you Know and you have to, you know, this is it, for better or for worse and we could, | don't think that any, any presidential Eva Edmands 78 [Date not labeled] Page 78 candidates today, running in '96 are especially inspirational and | think politics have taken a very negative turn, very nasty turn and | do feel turn off, I'll probably still vote, but I, at this time, | don't know who for, but I'm, I'm discouraged at the, at the direction the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 's going with the decline in the family structures, the rising crime, the, and just, the senselessness of some, you know, crimes that are committed, just for the sheer heck of it, it's, I'm not optimistic about the future of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and at times | think that I'm grateful that we didn't have children, because | would be extremely worried about their future, and not only economically, but drug scene and AIDS and all these things which, you know, we really didn't have to deal with when | was young.</span></p>
