<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  ... that's a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...uh...near what was at that time before the first world war...uh...the Austrian/Russian boarder because that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was...uh...in the <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ...<span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ...I think they called it <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> /Hungarian empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1"><span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> /Hungarian I don't know how...how you would say that in English really. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Uh...And the grandparents also came from very close to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">They lived there til the outbreak of the first world war, 1914, when my father was indoctrinated into the Austrian Army and Mother...uh...who at that time was pregnant with my older sister, Leah and we called her Tont...uh...fled from that <span class="REGION">area</span> ...took her mother along by the name of Freda and...uh...fled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My oldest sister was born on the way in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Uh...Ever since then until they had to escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> after the Nazis came in in 1938,...uh... we lived...we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">As a matter of fact, as far as I know we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until the last 2 or 3 months of 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Tell me...uh...please a little bit about your father's occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">What did he do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  After my father was demobilized from the army...uh...he... uh... built up a...uh... wine business and over a period of 20 years he built it into a very substantial <span class="BUILDING">wine wholesale business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh...finally, we had...uh...large <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> in the...I think it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">18th District</span> in ’’I....1 remember the <span class="NPIP">place</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It is a magnificent large <span class="DLF">court yard</span> with chestnut trees...uh...three <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> ...uh...and extensive underground cellars. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">At least I was very impressive by the fact that they were...uh....uh...barrels of wine higher than I was, which wasn't very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I wasn't very tall at the time, but they were about the height of a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And...uh...there were rows and rows of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalator</span> going down...uh...along which I guess they were transferring the barrels into bottles and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And he supplied mainly <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Some of the wine we also imported from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , like <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and I expect <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh...
QUESTION:  You as a child! </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Tell me a little bit about your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Did you have friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Well, uh...first of all, what I...I have to say something in general about the nature of my memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh...the Nazi period stretches across...uh...the landscape of my memories of my mind almost like a Chinese war. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">You can...there are chinks here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You can look through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">You can catch a glimpse of some of the things that happened beyond the war...before it, but...uh...this...this huge war has cast a long shadow, both backwards and forwards, and really dominates the landscape. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But I do remember some of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh...We were substantially a middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">As I say, we always lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which really means a street of <span class="DLF">front gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Each <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> had little <span class="DLF">front gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I remember vividly these were beautiful <span class="DLF">gardens</span> with...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flower beds</span> ...uh...carnations, forget me naught, roses...uh...and huge lilies. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">This was lilies I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh...The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> itself...uh...uh...was really properly built. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">You know, in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , you had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were built for centuries...uh...marble and...and brass and...and oak to us and so on and so forth, absolutely beautifully fitted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh...At first we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> and then we moved down <span class="DLF">stairs</span> to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mezzanine</span> , which is a kind of half floor. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It's almost on the level of the second floor as they would call it here because the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> is called the first floor in...1n...1n <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Uh...We always had as far...as long as I remember it any way, live in maids. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">These were generally girls who came from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and...uh...Mother...uh... was a very...uh... friendly and compassionate person. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She was always... always busy in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , mainly on cooking which was at that time a task that...that took up a good part of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh...The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sparkling. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh... was a bookworm. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I remember lying on my belly on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and seeing my reflection in the linoleum. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh...I was lost in books. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh...But I also had friends out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and...uh...used to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with those little marbles which at that time were clay, glossy clay balls. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">As a matter of fact, some were glass, but I liked the clay better because they were so beautifully colored. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh...I do remember vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Now before...before I come to the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , I want to say that there were two...uh...facts that I vividly recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">First of all, I had a rather strict father. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And that was very much in accordance with the fashion of the times. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">These were patriotic figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I loved him very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I remember the intense joy that I had when I heard the... his key grating in the lock. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I knew it was my father's key. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I knew more or less what time he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Mother was a very affectionate woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I am afraid that she...uh...she spoiled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">She was over-protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">She was always hovering over me when I was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The side effect, of course, was that I became the worst eater in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I mean it just came to a point that I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or milk or whatever and not feel sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I was a very, very bad eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So that...that...that was...that was a strong memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh...Somehow...uh...I was very much of a dreamer. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Books were my world of escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And I managed to enter this world and close the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind me and live in it for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="69"><span class="BUILDING">Elementary school</span> was just around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Uh...Well around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was in a part of the <span class="DLF">street</span> called, oddly enough, means beautiful <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that <span class="DLF">street</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> was called at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very independent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As I said, I was over-protected, and...uh...1t was difficult for me to separate myself from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the first place. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can see his friendly face. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh...so he spoke a perfect German. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I suspect that he might even have been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But, of course, you know, the Austrian empire at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">At that time when I was born and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslavakia</span> was already an independent country. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But before that it was part of the empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me whom I loved more, my mother or him. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I was intensely embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I'm telling this story to show that...uh...uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was a place of mixed emotions for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Anti-Semitism was endemic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> but there were loving persons, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There were individuals who and I did experience affection and love from some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">As a matter of fact, when he asked me this question, the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and Mother came in. (</span><span class="sentence" id="88">Laughter) So that just adds to my embarrassment. (</span><span class="sentence" id="89">Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Subsequently, we had a...a teacher by the name of Kanote. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Uh...and...uh...she also singled me out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students because I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I am today for instance Professor at <span class="BUILDING">Rutgers University</span> and...uh.... am very much guided by...uh...maybe this experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I like all the kids there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was the Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who 1s the son of policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I remember all these things so..so..so vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Uh...The reason I mention this again was to show you a little bit of the atmosphere there. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Uh...And I remember one occasion when...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt going with a...with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And she asked me to monitor the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of rowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned about myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that in....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways of controlling myself, of being in...1n complete possession of myself and consequently of the situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh...
QUESTION:  Let's talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Right...Well..
QUESTION:  When the Nazis came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">At that time...uh...that was, of course, I believe...uh... the date was the 11th of March, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And...uh...We had at that time a live-in maid by the name of Fritzi Shumberger. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The reason I mention her was she did play a little bit of a role afterwards and also she had a little emblem on her lapel. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It was...uh...in the shape of a boot, and subsequently we learned that it was the emblem of the leading Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I say illegal because before the Nazis marched in, the Nazi party was not legal in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">However, personally, she was not...uh...hostile to us and I don't think that she behaved badly when all is said and done. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh...I do remember the speech of Shoosnick who was at that time Chancellor, ” Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I was...I was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...1n our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in 186 204. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">That was the first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the left side...uh...as you came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and stepped up quite a number of steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do recall...uh...some of the words he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I believe he said To the death with red, white red, which is the color of the Austrian flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Red, white, red. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Uh...At least my memory tells me that he said the things that he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And...uh...Fritzi Shumberger, that maid, and my brother next to me (clearing throat) Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Guess I'll have to drink something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  That's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  (Drinking water) Uh...My brother Leo. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He was the next oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I was the youngest in a family of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And...and what separated me from the next one was a period of 6 years, very substantial. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But the other three...uh...were only separated in terms of 2 years and there was... So really there were two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was they and I. I always regarded myself as an outsider and I expect it was because of that large separation of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Anyway, Leo was there and Fritzi and she said something, "Oh wonderful and so on and so forth." </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh...Because obviously, I think she was going out with somebody who was a Nazi and they...they were very joyful about Hitler coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">As a matter of fact, many Austrians were....uh...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I'm confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Who was joyful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Fritzi Shumberger, our... our maid was very joyful about it and many Austrians were. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In any case...uh...and my brother remarked...he made some kind of...uh...negative remark about it, saying that...uh...,you know, there may not be that much reason to be happy. [...</span><span class="sentence" id="136">In any case...I do...I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I also remember the next day looking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">First of all, there were...there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> going...coming overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Hugh, hugh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> , droning and very low, almost...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the tops of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Black, black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They looked black to me or maybe that's just a psychological memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Uh...And every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was draped with a spastic of flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And these were hugh flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I am talking about <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , five floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And these were flags that...that went from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> right almost down to the...to the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and I should imagine that...uh...there was a very active, highly organized Nazi underground movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And they distributed all these these flags over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Also, there were many Nazis in all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">There was a substantial proportion of Austrians and Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="150"><span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> has always...uh... managed to portray itself only as the victim and I have to say most emphatically...and I don't want to be unjust to the many people in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> who were good people and kind people...but there was a large population of haters in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I don't think there was a single <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world that embraced Hitler so fervently as the Austrian nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And those of us who were there know it, experienced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Uh...I do remember that...uh...somehow or other I managed to either to allow my mother to go out or slip...I probably slipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I went pretty far afield because I found myself...uh...and this was probably not on the first week. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It was probably some weeks after the entry. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But it was a time when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in a procession. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I remember him...I remember him standing in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor car</span> , standing upright. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was an open...uh... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> were thronged with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean there was just one mass of people all waving and shouting and...and...and jubilant. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Uh...There was an ecstasy of joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I was standing there very quietly observing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Uh...At that time...uh...people who knew you before suddenly didn't know you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="164">Clearing throat) In our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , we had...uh...there were quite a number of Jewish families in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh...There were not many Gentile families, but I think... There were probably...it was probably half half. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There might have been three or four...of two I know definitely that they were Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Uh...One was called Garla, and he will appear later on because he tried to blackmail my father and caused his arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Uh...and the other one was Sargi, and this Sargi, you know, there was this special story there because they are...there was daughter and two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The two sons had been friends of my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But the friendship, I think had already more or less fizzled out...uh...uh...maybe a year or two before the Nazis came, but...uh...actually entered, but obviously, it was probably on the side of their becoming Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">One was called Franz and the other Willi. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Willi Sargi became an SS man, and Franz Sargi became an SR man. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Uh...And it's...they...they never personally undertook any action against us, these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And as a matter of fact, the daughter...I don't know her name...who was working...uh...as probably some secretary in the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> , <span class="BUILDING">local police headquarters</span> , was helpful to my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  I don't recall the exact circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I think it probably was...it might have been connected with the arrest of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I am going to talk about it a little later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But I know that my mother went...uh...to her and I seem to remember that when she came back that she said some nice things about...about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But I don't remember the exact circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I wasn't even told exactly what happened at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Uh...If I can stop a moment here because I have a sense that there was something happening...

<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  He was...uh...with the British army, the RASC. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I think he was first in the Palestine corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">There was...there was, in fact,...he was involved in a very significant rescue mission of Jews...uh...in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> who were held captive by the Gestapo and...uh...the group of...uh...Jewish soldiers...uh... I don't know that they were in command of the whole group or only of that particular transport of that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ...uh...crossed-through the <span class="DLF">German border</span> at the time and there was only a local armistice, a local armistice between the commanders and the Germans were still armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And they went right up to that particular headquarter, and the Gestapo had fled at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And they took all over a 100 Jews back to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I have to say, however, that my brother told me about this only once and that is when I saw him for the first time in 1953. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Uh...That is...uh... practically 15 years after...uh...the Nazi invasion or Nazi annexation out of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And we had a long talk in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He told me once about it and never talked about it again and...uh...now that I have a chance, I am going to try to get historical documentation because my brother was...uh... a rather quiet and extremely restrained sort of person and he...he's never mentioned it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And I think it was a significant...was a very significant...uh... episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">As a matter of fact he told me that when they came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , he formed...uh... the American Army and said that he instructions from <span class="BUILDING">British Headquarters</span> that here was a group of people who had to be taken care of and...uh...they...they were obviously people in very poor condition of health. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So he surrended them...he surrended them to...to the Americans and he said to them when...when they first arrived and the Jews saw them, something fell underneath and said they were angels. ....</span><span class="sentence" id="250"><span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">My parents registered me in a...in a training course for carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">There were a number of different (clearing throat) vocational courses being given under the auspices of...uh...the Coltis Commander, which was the Jewish...uh...uh...organization, the Organization of Jewry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I guess the idea was (a) since I would have to leave and they tried to send me out as early possible because obviously every day was..uh...I was threatened there...uh...to get me out of harm's way, to get me away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was a trap and also to give some qualifications, some sort of another. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And...uh... I remember...and I am going a little ahead and I will afterwards go backward, but I am going a little ahead of time because I remember on the day of the Kristallnacht which I believed was the 9th to the 11th of November, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I was in that carpentry workshop and there was a call on the telephone and the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> ...uh... went to the phone and listened very seriously and then he turned to us and said, "There is some action on the way and you will be safer at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I am going to talk abut this in detail a little later on because there was lots of things that happened in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I want to talk about them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Uh...First of all,...uh...a... a number of times...uh...the Nazis came to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They weren't exactly break-ins, but they weren't exactly visits either because these people came and..uh... they didn't bother to ring the bell or knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They...they generally beat on the <span class="DLF">door</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> so we knew exactly what kind of gentlemen were waiting out there.</span></p>

Uh...What happened there was that I had...whatever money we had left... don't know whether at that time we had already lost the business or not, but in any case, there was little business and people wouldn't pay us anyway even if we supplied. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Uh...So we had no money coming 1n and so we had a substantial business but you know as a businessman, we weren't that rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We had some money left to pay for expenses to move out or what, but whatever money we had left was our lifeline for escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I had become extremely adept at hiding things and at finding things. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And the reason why I had become adept was that, as I told you, I was a book worm and I would read through <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I mean literally shelf after shelf cause I remember my mother would take me to a <span class="BUILDING">worker's library</span> 1n this, I believe they called them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The Social Democrats built wonderful <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They...they become quite well renowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And they had <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> there and <span class="BUILDING">health clinics</span> and...uh...<span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and <span class="DLF">gardens</span> inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It was really a splendid world. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And they had these <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> , and my mother would take me there and for me this was a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And actually as I remember, they were really little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , but the glorious thing was there was these bookcases and they were stacked with books from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and I knew that each book was a world. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And it just entranced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Yall. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I would read indiscriminately, but they were mostly good books. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They were...at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> also we had, our <span class="BUILDING">saloon</span> was stacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We had all the classics. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">At that time we had paperbacks also the crown books they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That was before the Penguins. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I knew all the classics and I knew the Russians and the French, the dossiers and all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But my mother used to hide books from me that were classics even because they were too serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">For instance,...uh...and what an innocent world it was at the time, for instance...uh...and , Crime and Punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I am mentioning this because it later on plays actually a role. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">However, there was no place they could hide a book that I didn't find. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And...uh...the most peculiar <span class="NPIP">place</span> that my mother found was the stove pipe, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">saloon</span> and I found that too because I always...I put myself in her <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Now where...where would I hide something. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">A book...a book isn't such a small object you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So I became extremely skilled in nosing out things, where they might be hidden, and hiding things. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And I was the person consequently selected...you see how negative qualities become virtues in a world that's gone crazy...to hide whatever money we had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And what I did, and that was just before our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was ransacked and sealed, was...uh...we had these brass <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> which had hollow legs and you could unscrew the...uh...the wheels. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So I stuffed some money up there in the legs and then we had curtain rods that were also brass. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Hugh things! </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I stuffed some money there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Actually, you could only get them out with very, very long thin stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The Nazis, however, who were never book worms, never learned...uh...to learn to look..to look for things (laughter), you know, in those little hollow hiding places. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And they never found the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Now, then the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , after the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was sealed, and we were ordered...and we had no money... Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We were literally penniless. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So one day, Mother took me to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Central City</span> ...It was in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I forgotten the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I want to explain to you exactly what happened because I vividly remember every moment of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And, of course, she had me by the arm, you know, and we walked in and there was this...this splendid <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And there were people standing around. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I don't whether they wore uniforms or not, but there were people in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was a lovely <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and there was a <span class="DLF">spiral staircase</span> to the right and at the foot of the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> was a Soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I believe he was a soldier and not a SR man. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He might have been a SR man, but I seemed to remember he was a soldier. (</span><span class="sentence" id="439">Clearing throat) Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And he had a rifle there with a bayonet, a naked bayonet planted in...uh...the...uh...what you call that?...the...uh... on top of the rifle planted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And as we came in, he jumped mother and he saw a woman with...with a child there and he immediately decided we're Jewish and he shot at something like . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They used this expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It's like 1s like sow. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">It's a female pig, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And they combined it with...with the term Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And for them that was the way to call us. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And he...he...he advanced the rifle into a ready position and that's another heroic measure...here's a woman with a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And he made some kind of threatening movement, and my mother brushed by him as if he didn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Totally ignored him. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And he was an attack dog who...who had not been instructed how to deal with a situation like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And this is what happened sometimes 1n those situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">If you were really plucky or if you were desperate to the point that you didn't care...uh...sometimes you overwhelmed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But you had to have some presence in that control. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">As I said something that I learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">However, it didn't stand...it didn't help me in this situation because when we came in I was so embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It was, of course, a mixture of embarrassment and fear, but I honestly think it was about 90 percent or 80 percent embarrassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I was a very shy youngster, and here everybody was looking at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I was pulling at my mother's arms...let's get out of here, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I was so ashamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Just to be in the center of attraction, even if it hadn't been for...even it had been for purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But my mother let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I ran out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , but I was sufficiently able to see her, to watch her go up the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Well, my mother came out of this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with the key to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">You have seen her photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">She was a very impressive person and somehow when no matter who, like the Nazi, the SR man...the underling who came, and who must have had a spark of humanity in his mind and who left without doing any harm to us and even cautioned us to lock up and not open to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And here...this Gestapo officials of high rank, because they were the officials in the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and they gave her the keys. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But they gave her the key for 24 hours...24 hours or 48 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I think 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">It was enough for us to go in, take the money out that we had there and so make it possible for us to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">That was the second substantial visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It was really not a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It was...uh...say...1t was really a break-in to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Subsequently, of course, she returned the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Uh...Now...Now I want to...to...to go back or to go forward rather to speak about the Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Could we hold it? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">If you're moving to there, we're about ready to change tapes, so let's do that at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  You can take some water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We're back. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">You were going to take it up with Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Uh...Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Just before I go to Kristallnacht, there's something really significant I have to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">As I said, Father...Father was a broken man because....uh...he had lost his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Essentially, he had lost, in his eyes, his role. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">His role was that of protector. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And now he couldn't protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Mother, on the other hand, had gained a role because she had to do everything she had done before and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And she was always...uh...a housewife, a house person. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So Mother became stronger but Father just broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And Father wanted to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He...he wanted...he wanted...as a matter of fact, he really wanted that all of us should commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And...and not only, and as I told you before, that he lost consciousness...uh...every day and it was really a death that he wished. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He wanted us all to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">He wanted that all of us should commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was the only way out that...that he saw possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And every time that a Jewish family that we knew had chosen this path...had committed suicide... In one case I remember he was talking abut the family that went out to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they committed suicide at the <span class="DLF">grave site</span> , probably of their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he said, "What a wonderful thing these people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We should do the same thing." </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Uh...
QUESTION:  How did your mother respond to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  My mother very quietly...uh...I...I...1 don't even remember her saying anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">She just didn't accept his advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But all the time what had happened inside of me was in situations like this...uh...something grows up between you and your world, the world <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It's...it's that <span class="DLF">wall</span> that I talked about before, which had started to build up and you can really only survive at a very, very significant price. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And the price is...uh...that you detach yourself from your emotions and when you lose your emotions...when you lose your connection with your feeling, you essentially become...uh...an automated...you essentially become a sort of person drained of vitality because you don't want to experience what is happening around you, so you can't experience anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Uh...And once that happens...it isn't something...it's not like shoes you can put on and take off...and actually it sometimes lasts in some ways a life time. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Not in that horrendous form, but I will explain to you later how I emerged from all this into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But it certainly...uh...helps you escape and...uh... Unfortunately, we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The world didn't know how to cope with this psychological situation at the time so they thought you got out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Let's forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And that is essentially what happen, except you may forget it, but it doesn't forget you and...uh...it just goes on living within you. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Uh...The Kristallnacht and its generally known that...uh...what triggered it was...uh...the assignation by a young Jewish boy...I think his name was...uh...Green...
QUESTION:  Greenspan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Greenspan. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Who had...uh....shot...uh... some German official at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ...the <span class="BUILDING">Germany Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> by the name of” *. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Because...uh...they had...uh...I believe killed his parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  Don't worry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">What happened...Where were you at Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Uh...I was on Kristallnacht, actually that day I was...I was in the carpentry workshop. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And...uh...I mentioned before the telephone call came so when the manager of the workshop took the call and turned to us and said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">There is something going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You'll be better off at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We knew immediately what...what is going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We packed our...our stuff and...uh...we...uh... went...went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I remember...I had forgotten where this ...this carpentry workshop was, but I should imagine by the appearance of the...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> because I was waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but I know what kind of...uh... <span class="DLF">streets</span> we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Uh...It seemed to have been the inner city which is an unusual place for a workshop because these were splendid <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And I remember standing...you see the...the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had an open <span class="DLF">platform</span> ...uh...either at...at the rear end so you could easily jump on and off and you could be standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And I was standing along side. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It was close to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">There was an elegant couple and, you know, in those times when people were elegant, they were elegant. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">There was a very attractive lady and she was dressed in a beautiful silk dress it seemed to me, and a gentlemen and she was looking at the newspaper and seeing something and she turned to the man and said, "Look at this terrible things they're doing to the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Surely, this couldn't happen here." </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I remember those words because...uh...first of all, there are a lot of... Really, the only words I remember from that...from that period actually spoken because within a few seconds or a few minutes or moments or very short time after that, we passed a side <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on a side <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was this magnificent <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> in flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And there was a Jew in costume with a long beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Obviously he must have been praying in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he was running and there was a crowd running after him and he was like one of those you know, in the classic books that I was reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Uh...with a poem by Sheller about a Kraut chasing something or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And you flash by. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I mean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you know, how long does it take. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It was just a. And it was an ironic commentary on what that lady said...uh..to the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I remember coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was actually the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of my sister and...uh...there I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you must...and you must...uh...not remember because you don't know of this, but bear in mind that these were heavy reinforced <span class="DLF">doors</span> with not only massive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plywood that is used now, but genuine oak or something like, but also...uh...uh...steel bars inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">There's a whole...there's a whole <span class="DLF">steel door</span> inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So these were fortresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I don't know why they were fortresses because there were very few thefts there. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But nonetheless, at least before the Nazis, in which case these were really thefts, but...uh...these...these <span class="DLF">doors</span> were difficult to break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they very cautiously opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">My...I found there my...my...my mother, my sister and her baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Her baby was...uh...only about 2 months old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Rose was born in August 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So I can...I can position this in time because I...she was born in August 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I left on the 18th of December 38. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Of course, it's the Kristallnacht, 11th of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Well, I knew that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So...uh...she was 2 months...2 months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And Father wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I believe he must have been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And...uh...my brother-in- law had been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">My...my sister says that happened on the morning of the Kristallnacht, but at any rate I know that he was...uh...sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> in fact over...over half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Uh...How he got out of it alive, but...uh..and he went through terrible time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">In any case, when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , something strange happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I mean I was always the youngster, the kid and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And now I...I was the only man. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I don't know whether this is some genetics or the biology of relatives, I just...[...the diffident, the shy, the book worm and so on, assumed control quite naturally and I said, "If somebody comes, we won't open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We just don't open." </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And this...well, my sister was always a person...my sister was not a person who was very assertive. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">In any case, she would have taken a rather quiet role in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But my mother was a very courageous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But I think as a result of all that had happened...of what happened to Father...of the fact that both of them were arrested, she became...she was very quiet and she just accepted...uh...my suggestion without any demurring. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Well, we didn't have to wait long. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Shortly after, it was before lunch time, we heard these...uh... very well known...uh... boots beating on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they weren't just beating on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , generally accompanied by shouts...open up this that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We didn't open. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And I think probably...I have gone through some different phases in my life, but this must have been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and so as not to be seen from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> or so we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was built around the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and you could have looked in from the opposite <span class="NPIP">wing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So we had to stand pressed against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And my sister had to put her hand on the mouth of the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was a 2 month old baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And always be afraid that either she might stifle her inadvertently or that the baby would cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And here these men were battering on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you know, with the jack boots you can subject a <span class="DLF">door</span> to some treatment and it went on, it seemed to me, for an eternity. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And what went through my mind was the scene of in Crime and Punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">was a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But nonetheless, it was a scene of the most...and they were standing there in, I believe in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , after having committed the deed, and they hear some...some steps going up and then the <span class="DLF">door</span> rattling and he is afraid that the lock might...might open up because...uh...this...uh...was just some...some kind of...uh... what do you call it in English? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">It's...uh...we call it a..It wasn't...1t

<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I know what you mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Uh...And that scene flashed through my mind because I was always living half in the book and half <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then we...and we could hear everything that was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then...uh...one man said to the other...apparently, he was the leader of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He said to the other, "or whatever the name was, Go down and fetch a crow bar." </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And this fellow went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And, of course, our...way back...uh...was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We couldn't open. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They would have thrown us out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">At that moment, the <span class="DLF">door</span> from a neighboring <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> opened and there was a woman... I had never spoken to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Mother had never spoken to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I don't know whether my daughter knew her. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">She was a Gentile obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And she said, "You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">You're wasting your time"...or words to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">You could hear everything in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">You could hear things through the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And they went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And in the afternoon, they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And, of course, I had said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">They come back in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We open immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I don't want to go through this again." </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So when they came, we opened straight away. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But I, you know, my temper was...was sort of moving up, you know, again and I decided that I was going to sit at...uh... the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffee table</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">saloon</span> ...uh...drinking a cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there as if...uh... I couldn't care a damn about what was going on, just to show my disdain, you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I thought that this would make a significant impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I was really, you know, half serious, half child...uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And they came in and my sister had...uh...a side <span class="DLF">porch</span> , you know with <span class="DLF">sliding glass doors</span> and she displayed all kinds of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain, crystal...uh...the things that you got for our wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And, of course, they were after it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And one of the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who had never handled <span class="DLF">doors</span> like this tried to open and he sort of fumbled around and he couldn't figure out how this...this <span class="DLF">door</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Because the only <span class="DLF">door</span> probably that he...he got to know was the <span class="DLF">door</span> on hinges. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And I could see him sort of...I could almost read his mind...and holding his foot, his leg up in order to kick the <span class="DLF">door</span> in, and I jumped up. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And confronted him as much as I could confront him. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I mean my head was probably the height of his breast bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I said you know...and I again remember the words verbatim...there are two ways of opening this <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I said, "One is you lift your leg and kick it in like that, and I just imitated what he was doing, and the other one is like this and I put out one little finger and I just made the <span class="DLF">door</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And don't you think that's a better way. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I looked him in the face and he looked back and no words were exchanged...no further word was exchanged between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And, of course, they packed all the stuff up and took it away and walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And that was another visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">It was the most terrible because of what happened in the morning and that could have easily ended up, as I say, with our flying out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Uh...If you don't mind, a few things occur to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I want to go back to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">First of all (clearing throat), there was first of all two...two personal encounters and...uh...that I think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Uh...I had...I told you before that I had...I had learned in some way that in certain critical situations I could face up to things and somehow assert control. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It was almost a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...some measure of certainty that I had at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Some...some voice that came to me from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And I remember that one of the times it happened was even before the Nazis came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Uh...It was winter time and I was dressed...uh...in a very nice winter coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It was a new coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">with a herringbone and a velvet collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And here was a much bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> but ragged, obviously from very poor circumstances who came up and our <span class="DLF">steps</span> met at the corner and I knew that he wasn't going to shake my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I realized that he was gonna beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And I always had empathy for the underdog. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I had a very, very strong empathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I had really always a strong heart for poor people, for animals, for all things of that sort, and I felt ashamed actually of my...of our circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Even so, God knows,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with normally books, you know, or games of skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They never bought me a model set because I might break my leg or something, which I probably would have (chuckle) if they bought me one. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But I always had that...that feeling that...uh...I felt uncomfortable of having more than somebody else and so I didn't have to fake anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I...I really had an understanding for him and a feeling for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear because it took the place of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">It was...it was the feeling that possessed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I said to him...uh..." You know, I want...uh...there's something I want to tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I said it in a way that...uh...somehow or other seemed to engage him, seemed to engage his interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I was listening and I told him about the fact that I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and that many of us, even those of us who come from so-called...uh...<span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that were more affluent really wanted to choose this life for ourselves and that I understand where he came from and understand his circumstances that...that many of...of friends of mine, people I know have chosen a life of work on the <span class="REGION">land</span> , hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And there wasn't really as much difference between us as might appear. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And that I wasn't responsible for the fact that...that he was poor and that he was in difficult circumstances and we almost became friendly and they told...he told me about the fact that his father was beating him up and so on and so forth and, you know, his father was a drunkard. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But I will never forget the words that he said to me at the end and the words were...and this was a poor, maybe semi-literate, ragged youth, maybe a year before the Nazis came...I would say about... He says, "You know, Hitler is going to come here and then I am sorry...I am going to be sorry for all of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And these are words that I have forgotten easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">That was one encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The other one was already under the...under the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I was...uh...I think walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the time and...it was and it was the place where our <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> was, the little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Uh...There were sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">front pew</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">My father incidentally was the vice-president of the other group, which 1s...which was a Zionist philanthropic organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And my father was very active in public affairs and as a philanthropist, something that once saved him from the Nazis because I remember in a procession...procession that came by, and I was sort of listening at the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and somebody was shouting, "Let's take old Schmeltzer," and...uh...somebody else said, "Oh, leave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">At least he helps his own kind." </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So strange things happened...uh...even in those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">There was this <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> in the and I was not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">As a matter of fact, midway up that <span class="DLF">street</span> , in the where our <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Our <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> was at the corner of the where we lived in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Midway up there was a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And as I was walking... probably...I don't remember exactly whether I was walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or walking away from...at any rate I suddenly was surrounded by something like a dozen boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">It was like a ring around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And there were closing in on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And it was clear that they were going to beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">All of them! </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Together! </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And again that particular sense came over me that allowed me to detach myself from my personal circumstance and take on another voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It was almost as if I was reading a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And imagination has its place at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I said to them...I... raised my hand because I realized you know, I have to do something that attracts attention...I raised my hand at the time and said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Before you beat me up, I have something interesting to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And, of course, you know, rich boy... mean...everybody is curious...1 mean no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I said, You know, what's happening here. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">There's a dozen of you Gentiles, Christians who want to beat up one of me, one Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Now what are you doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You're really declaring that one Jew is as good as 12 of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And that...that sort of...that sort of made them look up. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I said, "I am going to tell the Nazi party about it and, you see, they'll be very angry at you." (</span><span class="sentence" id="701">Laughter) God knows where this came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It's really absolutely absurd. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It's ridiculous, but it somehow engaged their attention and they started to discuss this matter amongst each other. (</span><span class="sentence" id="705">Laughter) Because they were as little...uh...learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They had just...they picked up anti-Semitism probably from early childhood because it was endemic in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And as they were discussing things, a little <span class="DLF">gap</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They...you know, at one point they drew apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was just enough for me to flee through and I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">At that time the person who held the world's record in long distance running was a fellow called ...I think I outran him. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I ran so fast up, away from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , up the to which was a parallel <span class="DLF">street</span> , a very, very magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Well, it's a very lively vital <span class="DLF">street</span> that led up to the ticket of the I over took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and remember I told you they had these open <span class="DLF">platforms</span> and I jumped up and there weren't sufficiently close to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I mean they couldn't overtake me and they couldn't get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and so I got away that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Now I had mentioned something about <span class="BUILDING">shuls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I want to go back to this because something else comes up in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">A year before I had Bar Mitzvah and I remember standing in front of the mirror in our L-shaped <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , the one that I described to you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">My mother plunked some kind of blue hat on me which almost blotted my face out. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I had this little round face you know, and I was frightened out of my wits, and I was led to...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> almost like a calf to slaughter and I had to give this long you know which was half in Hebrew and half in German and these...these were long affairs and you had to know them by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">It took at least half an hour or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">You studied it for it months. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I remember (clearing throat) I stood there and I looked at the people and the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> was full of people and my heart sank. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">This was definitely not a moment of control. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And my voice said bye bye, just took leave of me and when I opened my voice...my mouth, almost no voice came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And my teacher, Hebrew teacher...his name was Daft, D A F T...was a young, modern man actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">He sat behind me and he leaned forward at this point and he said to me, "You know, if Mussolini can do it, you can do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I mean, again, outrageous statement, but this man understood something in me because I got so enraged at the fact that this is doing something and I can't doing it....Yal...that I completely forgot myself and I delivered a splendid oratory and everybody was weeping and the last one who wasn't weeping was my sister and I considered this as a personal affront. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And then I sort of focused my look. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I beamed it at her like a lazer beam and I said one or two sentences as I glazed and then she started weeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And then our...our family doctor, Frye, he was crying too. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Everybody was crying (laughter) in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Now, I...I mention this because Daft, who was my teacher, under the Nazi unfortunately something very tragic befell of him...befell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">One day his wife came to my mother and she was literally wringing her hands and said she doesn't know what to do because her husband had simply become mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">He picked up a knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">He said that she wanted to poison him. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">She was afraid of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">She was afraid to go to the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And...here you had a world of madness <span class="NPIP">inside</span> in response to madness <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ...uh... It was literally a world where all the controls, all the <span class="DLF">dams</span> broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Uh...And I don't really know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">But I do know that I once visited his <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">That was in the good times before my Bar Mitzvah and I was so impressed by the stacks of books he had and there was and I read the title of every one.... END OF TAPE 2, SIDE 2 service people of medical who were guarding the prisoners <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And they were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And inside were hundreds of German prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And these were giants. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">They were sailors. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">They were apparently caught...uh...you know either on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Here was a group of 30, 40 young Jewish school children, all from whatever happened in Europe and...uh...I think...I don't want to be adamant about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I seemed to remember there was swastika flags inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But I am not going to sign that underwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Uh...Certainly, there was..uh..a planned Nazi atmosphere also. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">There were no demonstrations against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was just enough to see these fellows around and we in the midst. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">There were only 30, 40 of us and we were children..very young boys of 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">None was older than 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">There were only a few Polish among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Then what happened was... we were about 2 or 3 months in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">What happened was that some of us were Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Now I wasn't Orthodox myself, but some of us were Orthodox, and they were strictly kosher, and they would not eat a non-kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And there was no provision for non-kosher food, and we all declared solidarity with those who were Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So they wouldn't eat non-kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We didn't eat non-kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">The result of it we were all starving and we were literally starving because...uh...all you could eat was cheese...uh...when...when it was served. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And I remember the mostly seemed to serve meat which we couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And I ate plenty of toast with jam because I was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I was very partial to toast and jam, must have eaten so much I couldn't stand it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But we were literally starving and in the end became so...uh...drained of strength...uh...that sometimes...sometimes we were lying out there on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and we couldn't even...hardly could get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We were really that much weakened. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I remember the Polish lad that was...I told you about this man, this , who become a friend of mine, was giving us daily lectures and he had extensive knowledge in various <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I remember in biology in particular, biology and literature and history and politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">These were his main subjects...and in psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And this man was so well read that through the three months he could give us daily lectures of 2 or 3 hours every day...

You know, war is a terrible thing, but I have to admit it's one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And to see those silver <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I mean if you detach yourself from the horror and to see afterwards the denotations blossoming like great yellow, red flowers and then parachuting and then when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> burst, there was a deeper color and then, the parachutes coming down like thistles. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">That was an unforgettable sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I...I felt very, very proud of those fighters that went up, and I am not a military person. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But, 1n any case, as I said to go back or to go forward, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell and the Germans became very cocky, very arrogant. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And some of them threw their finger across the throat when they passed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I don't know what our feelings were at the time, frankly. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I think so many things had happened to us in the beginning that suddenly, I didn't...I didn't function too much emotionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Uh...And suddenly, one day they decided to evacuate us to send us either to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I am not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And we were...uh...meant to go on a certain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I believe the name was Andora Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Somehow that name stuck in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I always associated it with that particular situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And all the Germans...uh... in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were sent on the Andora Star and there were some Jewish people, including a brother of my brother-in-law, from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He was interned too, of course, who was in the Andora Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Now we were taken off maybe a day or two before embarkation because...uh...Jewish...the Jewish Federation it. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the <span class="BUILDING">home office</span> , with the <span class="BUILDING">war office</span> , this that and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Look...what...this...our Jewish with the... They are boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">What you want to send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> for with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">They took us off the last moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">You know what happened to the Andora Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It was torpedoed. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">My brother-in-law's brother was killed among the others and later on when I was in again in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called... I met one of the rare Jewish survivors of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> incidentally so I...so I...I know the story all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And what he told me was that when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was torpedoed, the Jews were down in the steerage. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I mean they were down, and the Germans and the British were up and they were close to...and they...they took possession of all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifeboats</span> and the Jews were not allowed into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">life boats</span> and he was swimming along and he said he must have been in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> a hour or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">You can't measure time in that condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And he was almost losing his last ounce of strength, just couldn't go on and there was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">life boat</span> near him and he managed to swim up to it and stretch out his hand and get hold of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I have to say this ironic episode that happened was that a British person...a British, one of the mates of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , said, "Sorry, old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">You know, full up. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">This is not the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And the Germans said, "Oh, let the poor bastard on." </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And they pulled him up and so he was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And I think he must have been one of the very, very, very rare Jewish survivors from the Andora Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And there was another occasion when death was just moving past me as if he didn't know me...or didn't know me or didn't really want to know me...uh...and...and...and many...many other people have stories of this kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And those of us who escaped...uh... many of us had many escapes before you could finally get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">That takes us up to...uh...beyond...beyond the Andora Star and the return to...to internment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lensfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">No...We didn't return. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">They didn't take us out, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">We remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lensfield</span> , but shortly afterwards...uh...we were finally released and I remember the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wept. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Uh..There were a number of sterling British figures I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Uh...As I told...as I told you, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> is one of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> I have warm affection. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">It's not that everybody was a saint, but you make an overall appraisal of a nation, of a civilization and in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I loved them and my...my brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">He saw...he saw the British from another...another angle, but I have to say that I experienced them in their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and there are some just lovely, marvelous...uh...persons there and the general tone is...1s...1S just lot more civilized than the one I encountered generally in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I have to say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Now...uh...uh...there was another officer there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We called him Auntie. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">We called him Auntie because he was such a passionately devoted soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">He was such a lovely man. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Out of his own pockets, he would buy us things...socks and undergarments and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">He was another one who cried when we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">He was a marvelous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Now...Don't...don't think that every British was like this, but you don't need to meet that many persons and they do leave...uh...a strong...uh...1mpression behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They sort of light the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It's almost as if fate...uh...has decided well, you know, you've gone through this, that and the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">We'll send you a little light. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">So afterwards, when I got out of the internment...uh...there was an episode and here I am not absolutely certain about the...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events, but I know that my sister was evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalding</span> and I managed to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I managed to be for a few months there, working the <span class="REGION">land</span> , because I was then at the time on the war essential work order. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Uh...just to be close to her and I managed to survive some bombing attacks that practically pulled the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> down over us because the Germans mistook <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalding</span> for which was a nearby <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And they bombed...they released all the bombs on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Uh...Amongst other things...uh...they destroyed the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> and killed a lot of animals there. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Uh...After that I...I was in...uh...[ was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for some time and I can't date that. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I know that I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I know that I...uh...I thought up ways of speeding up production by a multiple of 2 or 3 by...because there were more machines there than...than people. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I worked out a mathematical system whereby you could keep 3 or 4 machines in operation, you know, only attended by | person. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And you could do it faultlessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">It wasn't even difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">However, I was watched by the supervisor. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">You know it is very strange, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And incidentally, I had a similar encounter because not everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was giving their best for the war effort obviously, but many did and many were very heroic. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So again, humanity and with all its...but...uh...there was another occasion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalding</span> ...uh...I worked for a period of time in the <span class="BUILDING">sugar refinery</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> and...uh...I had...uh...another encounter of a similar nature where I wanted to be a little more productive than a certain person, a certain woman and...uh... She then...She became so angry with me because she...because I was in the <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> ...I was supposed to be testing the molasses in the various stages of preparation as to be come to refinement. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And she spread the story about me that I was a German spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But unfortunately...fortunately, rather, she was known as a liar. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Nobody paid any credence to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Uh...I was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">So that was a very intense time. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> at some time...uh...but this was after I had gotten to... I returned to... It was in... That was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> around... You know... the great...uh...J am making and liquor making and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And we...we were living there in really terrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">The difference between and was difference between night and day...day and night rather because was an unsanitary camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">It had been condemned by the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It had no facilities, no toilet facilities even and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And we worked like slaves on the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I was there for about half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Uh...I eventually left and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I was followed by some of the...uh...at that time, a friend of mine, my alter ego almost and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> and...uh...I had the childish idea that I only needed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> and all <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> would open their <span class="DLF">door</span> and say, "Herr Schmeltzer, you know, now you are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Why didn't you come earlier? </span><span class="sentence" id="917">You see, we have just the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Well, I ended up as a gardener in <span class="BUILDING">College</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="919">Laughter) And I have to tell you it's...1t's a really amusing little tale because at that time I was preparing...I was on one of my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">You see, in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because my parents' forced me to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But once I had left and I wasn't under constraint, I felt that what I most passionately wanted in life was to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I always read intensively and extensively, you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Now I wanted to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So I thought going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> somehow or other was all you needed to do and say here I am and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Well, as I say, I became a gardener and I...1 am ashamed to say I used part of my time actually for study purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">What I did was that I...I organized the study plan to two <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Uh...the...uh...liberal art things if you like, languages and literature and that kind of stuff and grammar, I had this little notebook that I could hold in the palm of my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Mathematics and other things...mathematics I would rake out and smooth out a plot of <span class="REGION">land</span> , you know, and I would...I would draw geometric figures and so on on the <span class="REGION">land</span> and work them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And then I would enter them 1n a little notebook. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">But it turned out that the which were an administrative group of they were looking behind the <span class="DLF">window sills</span> you know in the stately <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and they were observing this strange person who was drawing figures in the soil, you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And they couldn't figure out what it was I was actually doing, but it seemed to occupy me for an enormously length of periods of time and I seemed to be absolutely obsessed with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So I was eventually called there and the words that...that [...that they said to me were, you know, we have observed you over a period of time and...uh...frankly, most of the time you seemed to be scratching things in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> or looking at the palm of your hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">We couldn't figure out what it is you are doing, but you didn't do enough work so I am afraid we have to fire you. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So I drew myself up to...and I am not very enormous length at the time...I said, "I am really ashamed of you because this 1s supposed to be an intellectual...uh... institution and...uh...I can tell you that I am probably more intelligent than any of the students you have, but they have lots more money than I have and if you were really an institution of learning and not of money, you would say, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">We really want you here as a student, but obviously you don't know anything about things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Good Day." </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And afterwards I was really kind of...I was almost trembling because I wasn't... wasn't cock sure at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I think it was...1t was part of my general nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Anger that was kind of spilling out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">In retrospect...uh...there was very little...they... they... they...that they could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I guess they were only acting according to their best understanding of the way the world worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And I was little...a bit outside the scheme of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> I thought...I almost...almost was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I wanted to volunteer to be a fighter pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Maybe this period of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying over...also the fact...the fact that I...I just wanted to...to...1 wanted revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  May I...We have 10 minutes left on this tape, so what I am going to suggest we do 1s if you can encapsulate what happened to you and tell us what happened because I want to bring you...uh...to where we had discussed earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I want to bring you to after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Yal.</span></p>

That happened before, of course... Before the...uh...invasion of Europe and...uh...again, I was taken off the unit about a couple of days before the unit in training and I want to tell you what happened.</span></p>
