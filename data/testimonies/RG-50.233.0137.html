<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  The date is April 2, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We’re speaking with Jack Trompettor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Mr. Trompettor, could you please tell me you name at the time of the war, your date of birth and your place of birth and anything you possibly can about your family background and you childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Well my Hebrew name is Isaac, Yitzhak. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was given the name Jack at the time because it was not safe, I suppose, to call children Isaac. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> which, at the time, was taken over by the Germans and used for their Wehrmacht wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So there was my mother lying there and having me and because the family name in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trompettor</span> , not Cohen or Nathanson, it wasn’t evident giveaway that it was a Jewish name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  The date, when was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  This was August 2, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">When my mother gave birth to me it was also the same time that my father had been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was arrested in what’s called a razia which was a raid which was what the Germans at that point would do in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They would come into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , seal off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and then just pick up all the men that they could find and in this case my father was caught and he was taken to <span class="DLF">Oester Park</span> , <span class="DLF">East Park</span> which is a <span class="DLF">park</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> where they held them. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And then they transported them, to the <span class="DLF">Uterperstaad</span> which was where the Gestapo had their central <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that they took over and they had some kind of, I think, <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium building</span> , or some <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> -like <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they had all the men lie down, belly, face down and they beat the men on the backs and on the legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We, of course found all this out afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My mother did not know where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She gives birth to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">She is understandably terribly, terribly anxious and afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">There was a curfew at this time and no Jews are allowed on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> at certain hours which made it all very difficult to do shopping and even visiting someone at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But it turned out that my mother’s father, he was a man in his late sixties who wasn’t afraid and really didn’t, I suppose, care about this curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He was going to see his daughter and grandson.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Did he wear a yellow star on his coat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  You know, I don’t know; it’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He came to visit my mother every day during the period when my father was -- his whereabouts were unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mother got ill after she gave birth to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I guess anxiety and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She was beside herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Finally, and I don’t know within how many days this transpires, I think maybe three or four or five, my father is let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He calls up his <span class="BUILDING">work place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They send a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> which was what you had in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> then which was to transport goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">You had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> with sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> in front and they put him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and they took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The reason they did that was because he could barely walk because he was beaten on his legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It’s an interesting story how he actually got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And how he got out was, as he told it, all the captives were lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And they had the Gestapo, they had the green police, they had the Dutch police, those Dutch police who were collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They had all levels of police. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Everyone wanted to be a brute of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Everyone wanted to get in, in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The Germans were very, very concerned with TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They were very, very concerned with that, I guess, what’s the word I’m looking for, plagues or some kind of -- what’s the word I’m looking for -- not a plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Contagion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Some contagious disease, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And they had a doctor who was a Jewish doctor look at all the men and ask the men, the captives, questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Based on these questions the men were let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And to be let go meant to be kicked in behind and told to get the hell out and never come back or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The Germans were so afraid of contagious diseases that their solution to contagious disease was to throw people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">This doctor was someone my father had known. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">In the twenties my father had some kind of a lung problem and it wasn’t TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But at the time you carried with you some kind of identity card I think that you with if you had some kind of a medical emergency you could whip it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So he had a card with him and somehow he had the good sense to have the card out or show it to the doctor and the doctor and German officers are standing at this point in front of my father and the tension is throughout all this very, very intense and very high and a lot of questions are being asked and crisscrossed. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">At the same time the German asks the doctor if this man has TB because of the card. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He ends up saying yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But if turns out he’s saying yes to another officer’s demand who is saying, mach shnell, mach shnell, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The level of tension was purposely created by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">This is what they did to disempower people, to terrorize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And it was a tactic; it was a Strategy. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It wasn’t simply people losing their temper. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was a strategy of terrifying people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So they’re asking what’s going on, mach shnell, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It seems to be misunderstood by the head officer that my father indeed had TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So they grabbed him, they boot him 1n his behind, they throw him out, lucky him. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He gets to a phone, calls up his <span class="BUILDING">work place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They send over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to discover he’s had a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I don’t think he was able to visit my mother or myself in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My mother comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Everybody is very happy to have me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I was named Isaac, Yitzhak, he who laughs. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The first time I asked my parents, when talking with them about the war experiences why they would want to have a child during this time, why they had me. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They said it was their blow against Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I have very mixed feelings about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It makes me a little choked up as it does right now because I feel in some way it casts me in some kind of historical responsibility and there are times where I would say I wish that they didn’t have me then on one hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">On the other hand I’m always grateful that they provided themselves to bring me into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That’s the bottom line. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So I am the blow against Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  That is a responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Can you back up a little and tell me about your family history. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Are they long time Dutch Jews or had they come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or .......
ANSWER:  Yes, my family name Trompettor. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There is some dispute whether we are Sephardic which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trompaita</span> or whether we are Ashkenazim from the East. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I tend to think we were Sephardim. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The reason for that, actually, is a number of years ago Time Magazine, the New York Times Sunday magazine had an article on <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">On the cover they had a picture of a young boy who trained horses and it looks just like me, like I did when I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So there’s a cast to my face that would give that some authenticity. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So I think we were Sephardim although we did not speak Latino in our family nor did we speak Hebrew in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My parents were working class people. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My mother had three brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My father had three brothers and three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Q They all were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes, we were Amsterdam working class people. </span><span class="sentence" id="91"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> by the Dutch was known as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mokum</span> , M-O-K-U-M, which was a, I don’t know how but it was a Yiddish word for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and it got into the lexicon. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The Dutch refer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> often as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mokum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Not just the Jews use that term. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I think I’d say you know who came from the East and came from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was very hospitable to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My parents family, many of them worked in the diamond cutting and polishing industry which was the main industry for the Jews as well as textiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You had different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There was one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> called the <span class="DLF">gold coast</span> which was where the more well-to-do Jewish people would live. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Then there was what was the Yodebrastaat which is the wide <span class="DLF">Jewish street</span> which is, I think, also the <span class="DLF">street</span> where Rembrandt had his <span class="BUILDING">tourist home</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It’s the southeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It’s where many of the Dutch Jews lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Do you know where their families lived, your parents’ families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Yes my parents’ family lived in the neighborhood of the Yodebrastaat. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We lived right after the war in the <span class="DLF">Tunsvalstraat</span> right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tunsvalkad</span> which was a <span class="DLF">canal</span> as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> is crisscrossed by <span class="DLF">canals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Is there anything else I could say about my parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Do you know anything about Jewishly like were they religious, were they observant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Yes, my parents both went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> when they were younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We were not a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">You must understand that the Dutch Jews were mostly working class people and while my parents and their families set a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> every Friday night there were no prayers said and I don’t think there were blessings said over the bread or wine with the meal but all the children would be there for that dinner and some with their sweetie pies and after dinner they would all leave for their Friday night gallivanting, you know young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There’s not much talk in my family of poverty or anything like that even during the depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There were hard times. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There was always food. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">My father worked in the food trades, in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> trade and always had food, brought home food. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So there was always that. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And also he was one of the brothers who always seemed to have worked during the hard years. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My grandmothers did not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They were grandmothers which was a job in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">My mother and father knew each other when they were in their late teens. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And as my mother tells it, she had a crush on my father because he was so quiet and sweet and I guess, polite. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They met each other through my father’s sister Maricha, Marie who perished and had become sweethearts very early on and had been very fond of each other and close to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was, I guess, in those days that you paired up real early. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But they were engaged for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They didn’t married until they were thirty and the reason for that is that they wanted to save money for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And now my mother talks about how she regrets in light of course not knowing about the war that they didn’t get married sooner and have babies sooner. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I always kind of wondered why they didn’t have more babies and in some ways regret not having children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Do you know your parents’ dates of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">You know at a certain age if you don’t send them a birthday card you have <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My father was born in 1911, May 25". </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My mother was born in 1910, June 14". </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So we're all summer babies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  So that was the situation leading up to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Ha your mother been working, did she have a career?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes, she was a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">She talks about having loved her career as a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">In her manuscript which she spent seven years writing she talks about the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> she was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She talks about the labor struggles. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">During this time there were many, many labor struggles. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">My parents were as many Dutch Jews were working class people and by and large they voted for the Social Democratic Party which here we would mistakenly call Socialist or Left. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They were a liberal democratic party whose interests represented working class people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they also took part of the culture of the Social Democratic Parties and on the first of May, you’d have picnics, you’d have festivals. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You would often have camping trips that these parties of the Left provided for young people which my parents often went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And your question before about a <span class="BUILDING">religious household</span> , I do not recall ever having heard my parents talk about a <span class="BUILDING">religious household</span> although there are some times now when I talk to my mother and she disputes that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I think she may dispute it because there is some matter of pride but I don’t think, and she would know better than I what happened in those years, but I never heard talk about her religious upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I know we never had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The first time I stepped into a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> was when I was Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So you didn’t go for the High Holidays or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my parents pleaded with my brother and I to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> for the High Holidays and we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And we compromised. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We said well we’ll get dressed and we’ll walk around <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> so everyone will see us but we’re not going in because we didn’t know Hebrew and also being refugees and being survivors we felt in a way alienated from the Jewish community about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And that is something that is very typical of people with our story. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">In some way we were met with a lot of not understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I always have felt very alienated from Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I knew when I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> there were times where I would be beaten up for being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Easter would roll around and the Italian kids, boys, would come from <span class="DLF">Avenue X</span> and we lived on <span class="DLF">Avenue Z</span> and <span class="DLF">Avenue Y</span> was a <span class="DLF">dividing line</span> and you had the Italian people living on <span class="DLF">Avenue X</span> and the Jewish people living on Avenue Z. And as what was popularly known then Jewish boys did not fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They did not fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So Easter would come around and I with my friends would be playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and Italian boys would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and they would tell us we killed Christ. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I didn’t know who this boy Christ was, I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I certainly knew that I and no one had killed anybody recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So they would attack us and beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We didn’t know about fighting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So that happened a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I guess that was one of many punctuation marks in my feeling not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And for many years I did not in some way come out as being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I did not come forward with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I did not cultivate my social relationships based on people being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I had friends from all kinds of groups as I do now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  But meanwhile though your parents had settled in a basically <span class="REGION">Jewish area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1949, my parents, my brother, who was really my step- brother as I'll go on to tell later, my aunt and uncle and their two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Far Rockaway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">First few months we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and we all slept on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And then at some point we got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockaway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We got two <span class="INT_SPACE">basement apartments</span> which were about three blocks from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> which us kids in the family absolutely loved because it meant our summers we had a lot to do and to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But in the spring when the rains came the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> would always be flooded and we’d always have to buy a new rug. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So it was a sort of immigrant story. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And then in 1951 when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beachhaven</span> which was one of the first projects that Fred Trump built (which is the Donald’s father) built in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , my parents moved out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was a very big step. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It really was an attempt for my parents to start to build something for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">At one point they talked about wanting to move to <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> which was also considered a step up and buy a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there which they never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I as of late come to understand that there was a subtext to our life which was around the matter of denial and that had to do with getting on with life and putting all that stuff behind us, just get on with life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  I hate to stop you but could you tell me what happened to your family during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We started with your birth so there are two more years at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  There’s plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So I was born on August second. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">This was the time when people were already being deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestaburg</span> which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in the moors, God forsaken nowhere place. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestaburg</span> every Tuesday the transport went east. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">People went either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelmo</span> where most of my grandparents, aunts and uncles perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Because our name was Trompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a lot of typical Dutch Jewish names my father who belonged to a butcher’s union which was taken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish names would all be crossed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Trompettor was not crossed off which meant we would continue to get their news letter but this time with the National Socialist masthead on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So my father would conspicuously leave it on a little side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> by the <span class="DLF">door</span> in case there were raids and people would come in they would see this and think my father was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Upstairs though in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> lived my mother’s parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">During this time the Jewish Council in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> as there were in many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had a list of all the people who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who were Jewish and the list was made available to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I know there is much argument about the role of the Jewish Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Because my parents were, I guess, working class people and sympathetic to the left of the political spectrum they had a certain kind of savvy about what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> from ’33 on you had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so stories got around. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">People got a sense of the brutality that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">When my father was arrested and beaten up as he tells it, he was of course among other things shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Something like this never happened to him and he felt that with this kind of brutality it was going to get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and that if they were capable of this no one was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And that’s what he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Before that happened there was the curfew, there were people being taken away, there were street fights in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Dutch fascists would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> , the ice-cream parlors, the <span class="BUILDING">tea houses</span> and start fights and there would be these altercations. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But when he was beaten up he understood how bad it was and he decided then he was going to go underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He was not going to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">My mother’s brother, Shok who is the name I was given, Jack, in honor of him, I think he was a very active Socialist and as my mother tells the story right before or after I was born she’s in my parents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mother’s brother Shok is still living there she enters into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and sees him with a tallis and he’s praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And she is shocked because she’s known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an atheist. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">My mother says what’s going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And he says, well he’s praying so his parents won’t be taken away and has decided that he will go and register in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Throughout the early period of the German occupations and the subjugation of the Jewish community there were continual regulations that were tended to deceive people. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">One of them was that if the young people in the family would register, the old people would not be taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">This was of course a way of sabotaging and undermining any form of resistance and many, many people believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">You have to understand and appreciate that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">What some people might see as stupidity or cooperation isn’t quite that. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It has to be understood in the context of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that’s very much concerned with law, with rules, with order. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I always feel that they’re kind of caught between the anvil of Calvinism and the hammer of Anarchism and the reason for that is because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> are international cities and the Dutch have been for a few hundred years an international merchant people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So not to register was considered an illegal act even though it was clear to many that those who were in power, who made the law, were evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But my father decided he was not going to register, he was going to do something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">That was a very big step. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was the first step to resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Many people of course had no idea what was going on in the east after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">People really believed they were going to be settled in some <span class="DLF">farm</span> somewhere to dig potatoes and till the soil. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But because my father had a certain political savvy he knew what German Fascism meant as people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So he decided he was not going to register; he was going to go underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The problem was what does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">How do you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Who do you make contact with? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Who do you trust? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And it was all luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So my mother’s brother Shok decides he’s going to register to save the grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He registers. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">He is sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestaborg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">At some point from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestaborg</span> he sends my mother a card, my mother and father a card that says don’t bring the red <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby wagon</span> which was their code for saying do not come, do not bring Jackie as I was known because even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestaborg</span> which was not as horrible as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the east there was constructed to deceive people. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Actually when I say this I am stunned at how remarkable the deception was, to be deceived. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">In some way I know this is in hindsight I get very angry at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">How could people be so stupid? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And on the other hand how can I say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And all of it is a, it’s a mix of feelings one has, I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  I think you pointed it out when you said how the Dutch people were concerned with order and all that and they say they came in so fast to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and people were in shock and they just rounded up and took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I don’t think they had time to really think. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That was my impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  Yeah, but you know they had people coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from 1933 with stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  True. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">True.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation other than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He’s the ultimate form of European bullyism. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So my father comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; Iam born. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They decide they’re going to go underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And one of the terrible things that also happens is that one considers the older people, the grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">What do they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">How do they go underground? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And the family is kind of in some way the younger people start to provide for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">This is a question my cousins and I have often wondered about. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">What about the grandparents; what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I understand it’s a terrible question and it’s one I have asked my mother and never really gotten any kind of a satisfactory answer and I’m a little bit ashamed to even pursue it. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But I wonder about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I can tell you one story, terrible story. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My father has the newspaper with the National Socialist masthead left at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">There is a raid one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The Dutch police, the green police which were the German police come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They know the people who live upstairs are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They come to take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It turns out to be my mother’s parents and it is my mother’s mother’s, my grandmother’s birthday that this happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And my mother of course 1s beside herself in shock, terrible, terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You can imagine how terrible something like that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">My father gathers his wits; he goes to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">He says, we’ve known our neighbors for a long time could we please say goodbye to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The Germans say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So here are my parents saying goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My father is saying goodbye to his in-laws, my mother is saying goodbye to her parents as if they were just neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It’s a terrible thing and I often wonder what my mother has done with that pain and that grief. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">She has written it all down. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So my mother’s parents are taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I don’t know whether at this point before or after my father’s parents are taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Some of the brothers and sisters have been taken away, some have not. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Those that remain decide to go underground and it means you don’t tell anyone else where you’re going because it’s unsafe. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">All you could do 1s tell your parents goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">When people went underground at the time they had no idea for how long this would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">No one knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Some people thought weeks, months. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">No one thought of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">My parents had saved some money so they had money that they knew they would need to provide for their keep while they were underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They made a connection through someone they knew who knew someone who knew someone to two people whose names are Cory and Jan Van Nomberg who are people who I now know as my aunt and uncle who live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> who we have been very close to since the war; people who I’m very, very fond of. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He was in the Dutch cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He was a sort of, I wouldn’t say monarchist, but he was a very good Dutch patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> , a Catholic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="288"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is kind of divided like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The people in the south are Catholic, the people in the north are Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They came from a good Catholic family but he hated the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Not that he hated National Socialism but he hated the Germans because they invaded his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He wanted to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">My parents ended up with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">At first the story was that my father was on the run; he didn’t want to serve in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I don’t know, what you would call a deserter. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So they were taken in by Cory and Jan based on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But there is a sense that Cory and Jan did kind of know that that was not the story, that they might be Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">At some point early on in their underground experience it becomes apparent, it’s talked about and Cory and Jan decide well we’ve gone this far with you we’re not going to turn you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And my parents spent from November of 1942 till the liberation in May with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I went underground about a week, a few days or a week before they went underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was three months old when I went underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You can imagine, if you can imagine what it was like for my mother to give up her child with the hope that she is saving my life with always the knowledge of the possibility I’m being offered up to destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We were one of the lucky families. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">My parents survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Did they circumsise you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  I was circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It’s something I don’t understand why people would take the chance of doing that, would take the chance because when there were raids the Germans would pull down the pants of the men in the <span class="DLF">street</span> to see if they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Remarkable, remarkable, crude to say the least. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Yeah, but you know I guess you circumcise your child to show your fealty. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It’s a practice that I have real questions about. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I’m afraid that I’ve gotten lost in some -- I’m not in a <span class="DLF">track</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  You went underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">You were sent underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yes, I was sent underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I spent the first night with my mother’s brother’s wife, Ollie, who was a gentile woman, my mother’s brother Morris, his first wife died in childbirth. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He marries Ollie. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Ollie is a gentile woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Ollie has me for one or two nights and my parents know nothing of who has me or where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The deal is if the family goes underground it’s best to separate the children because at least that will raise the chances of someone surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So I go with Ollie and eventually I’m passed on to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I spend a short time in a Quaker children’s home, a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It turns out that when my parents are also underground Cory, of Cory and Jan who are taking care of my parents, Cory goes to check on me to see how Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">This is done without telling my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">My father knows about it, Jan knows about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I don’t know why they didn’t tell my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They made some assumptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Cory goes to see how I am doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">She goes to the <span class="BUILDING">Quaker home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">She’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">She has a bad feeling about the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">She takes me out of there right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She spends a night with me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They talk about that there was fighting or shelling somewhere around there but it’s 1942 so I don’t really understand whether there’s resistance activity or what but this is how it’s talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">She gets me to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I am finally placed in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hino</span> which is about 35 kilometers from the <span class="DLF">German border</span> with a very poor Protestant family, people who are in their sixties, the family De Chot. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Cory comes back which she does. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">She has the good sense to go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that’s sort of like the equivalent of a Fotomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">She has a picture taken of me that she can bring back and show my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">My mother, in this time, doesn’t know why Cory has been gone for so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Jan and my father know but they get worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">She doesn’t come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until very, very late the next day and she lays it out to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Your boy is safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We had to take him out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They find out subsequently it turns out that the next day this <span class="NPIP">place</span> 1s raided -- that children are taken out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The adults there are arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So Cory has this sense, has her sixth sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  It’s not all Jewish children there was there or were there many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  There were many, many Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">What they would do is they would mix the Jewish children in with the -- it was like a <span class="BUILDING">Quaker orphanage</span> -- with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And this was often how it was done when Jewish children were hidden in groups, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">This is how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">When the children like myself went underground the parents were told to remember the clothes that the children had on. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The people who received the children like myself were told to save that clothing because it was the only way to identify a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So the story goes that my mother had a bathing suit that they cut up. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Because she was a seamstress they made a little pants for me, a little top and a little hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">This is what I was delivered in eventually to the De Chot family and this is what they kept... So what we are all in hiding, my parents not knowing whether I’m alive or where Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">My mother tells the story that every night before she went to sleep she would pray for my well -being. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They had cut a lock of hair from my head that she had and she would use this as some kind of reliquary, some kind of talisman pray for my hair, pray for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Every night ask my father when was it going to be over was it going to be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And of course what could the poor man do but say yes my dear, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So they were hidden with Cory and Jan from the end of November till May of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">For almost three years I was separated from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">When I first agreed to do this interview, when I was told about it my first response was well you know there are so many people who are older who have more powerful, more horrible stories to tell, they’re important to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And then I thought but who will tell the story of people like myself who were at this age if I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So it was a big step for me to decide to do it because in the community of people who are survivors, people who are camp survivors, people who are underground survivors, there has been a kind of presumptuously established hierarchy of suffering, that those who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> suffered the most and they probably did. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They did indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But it meant that for those of us who didn’t suffer like that we couldn’t really tell our story because it was not as bad because we had that one potato that we should be happy for. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And this has been very problematic. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Because of the conference last May this was a subject that was brought up and talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And even at the conference I had an instant where I was in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> and there was an older woman standing there, a short woman, and she had a little identity card which we all had which said our name, what <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we were from, where we were hidden and what years. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And she’s squinting up and she is Dutch as I can see and I chat with her and she’s squinting up and looking and says oh you were just a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I was very angry with her and I thought how can you be so thoughtless at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But it is part of the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It is the problem who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- although to feel and I can’t be anything but sympathetic with that but 1t doesn’t allow me to tell my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And I think this is an issue that has now been brought forth and dealt with as being one of the issues that we all have, that it’s all authentic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Certainly, by all means. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Did the Americans liberate your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  The British and Canadians. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I was in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , my parents were in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was liberated some time early of ’45 and people at the time didn’t know what was going on in the north but in the north you had what was called the hunger winter because as the Germans were being defeated and withdrawing they took all the foodstuffs they could lay their hands on and the consequence was that something like 15,000 people in <span class="REGION">northern Holland</span> died of hunger because there wasn’t anything they could put in their stomach, remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I lived on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Fortunately there was some food available. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I’m told the story that the people who took care of me would share everything they had with me and it was very, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">When I was finally found I looked like a picture of what we see today of starving children. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I had a swelled head, tiny little body, skinny bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But I had my share of what other people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I guess for my parents to have seen me eventually like this and to know this made it difficult for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">It raised the guilt ante for them; the guilt of having given me up even though the intent was to save my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">There were all kinds of complex inter-family dynamics come out of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  How did they ultimately find you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Good story. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So my parents are liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">They’re living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> turns out to be a sort of central command place for the British and Canadian army as well as the place where all the people who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> come, all the Dutch Jews who come back -- all, the few -- all, whatever twenty of them, come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> and there; there’s the Joint Committee of various Jewish organizations from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that help in finding people, in relocating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It turns out that my father with the liberation gets a job with the British army as some kind of cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He does this temporarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They ask him to sign up for a year, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">He says forget it, he’s out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">As far as he knows he’s the only male survivor of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He’s going to find out where the children are. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He knows the children are hidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">He’s going to find out where. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So as the story goes, he like Charlie Chaplin has a stick on his shoulder with a bag at the end of it and because there was not yet any real public transportation he hitchhikes on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicles</span> -- goes to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- finds out there’s a resistance group there. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">There were a lot of church people who were instrumental in hiding children; finds this pastor who turns him on to a priest, who turns him on to a mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He finally finds his way to know that there is a young boy who fits my description who’s hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hino</span> in this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He’s hitchhiking. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He appears there. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It’s night, it’s dark, it’s a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He bangs on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">People lean out the <span class="DLF">top window</span> , what’s going on, who 1s it? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">He tells the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">My name is Gerrit Trompettor. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I’m looking for a young by described so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Would he be here? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And there is some pause and finally they say well yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He comes in but they don’t wake me, it’s late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He sleeps in a <span class="DLF">hayloft</span> or somewhere on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">In the morning I am brought to him, I sit on his lap and I say “peen in ma book, peen in ma book” which is the Dutch rural expression of “pain in ma bouk” which means pain in my stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Gerrit thinks I am talking about a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The Dutch word for stomach is “book is “book” The Dutch word for stomach is ‘“bouk”. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Because I’m speaking this flat rural accent he doesn’t understand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It turns out I’m talking about pain in my stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I’m hungry or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I don’t know at what point he comprehends that he and I are speaking an entirely different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But it turns out that he has a talk with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They find out he is my father, I’m his son and he’s come to take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I’m having trouble right now recalling whether he takes me the first day or whether he leaves me there and he goes back and he gets Celene, the mom in this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And it’s interesting that I’m having trouble recalling that. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Anyway I am reunited with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I am undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I am sickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I am brought to a doctor who informs my parents that with food and care in a short while Ill be back to normal, I’ll be fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  You’ve absolutely no recollection of any of this, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  No, I also find it very distressing that I have no recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But I’m between the ages of three months and two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Now I know there are stories of people who remember some things two, three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I have two recollections. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">One of them is that I am in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I am picked up and very quickly brought to a <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and I am put in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> is a hobby- horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And I sit on the hobby- horse for a while and I hear voices downstairs and then later I’m brought downstairs again. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I don’t know whether this is a dream or a memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">That’s all I really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And as I said it distresses me because I really have a need to know and understand more about this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">In our family as it happened in many families after the war when there were hidden parents and hidden children the main story in the family was that the parents were hidden and survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And then there happened to be the story that the children were hidden and survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But we were very young; we had no story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So our story kind of fell into the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And in those years, right after the war and even in the fifties and sixties there wasn’t any understanding or talk or research or literature or anything on what it was like for children who had to be reunited with the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I often talk about that I was adopted by my parents in 1945 because here I am a three year old kid who talks a different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It took my parents a while, my parents and I to understand each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And here I am thinking, I suppose, that I’ve been taken away from my parents by this new couple who tell me they’re my parents and there’s the program and I have to get with the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I have to love them as they love me and it caused a great deal of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It still does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  You think that was really one of the main tensions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  Well it has been, I have come to understand it as one of the main tensions. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I have, I realize now, been a depressed man for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I have been an angry man as well and unable to commit myself to many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I now understand what all that is about. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I mean there are psychological dimensions to all of this that I don’t even know if they’re important to speak about whether this is pure quote unquote history or -- there are people who to this day suffer because of what happened to them during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There are others like myself who have problems because of what happened right after the war because denial was the order of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And it meant that those of us who are younger could not delve into our story. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I have always when I was a young man living with my parents asked them about the war, terrifically curious, as Iam now. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And there was a way of finding my own voice and my own story. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But when it came to asking questions about the people I was with, what happened to them, what was it like, I always came up against some form of denial, always, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">In 1985, I think it was the year, it was the year before my father died, I was visiting my parents who since 1972 moved back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I was determined to find out more about my history and about these people, the De Chot family. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And I told them, I said I’m going to find out about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Id like you to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">If you don’t, fine but I’m going to do it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Well my parents must have conferred that evening and reached a wise decision and said well we’ll go with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Let’s make a day of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So the next day we drive to this area of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we go to a <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearby to find maps, names of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We don’t find much but we drive around and we drive to where my father thinks the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Well it turns out it’s a major <span class="DLF">highway</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There’s nothing there -- it’s obliterated but we do pass through what’s the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my brother/cousin was hidden and he was like fifteen kilometers from me and nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But we saw the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that he was hidden in and we recognized it because we had a photo that was made right after the war and it showed the same <span class="DLF">wrought iron fence</span> , a very beautiful intricate design and it was immediately clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">My brother who was really my first cousin was taken care of by a woman, Mrs. De Fries, a very fine woman, a religious woman who had a hard time giving him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But after the war my parents stayed in close contact with her and in the early fifties she came and spent part of a summer vacation with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">My parents in some ways were very wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They knew that the separation between us and our foster parents would be problematic and in some way no matter what people did out of the best of intentions there would be problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And I realize this now. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I see a therapist twice a week which is enormously helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It’s paid for by the Dutch government. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I talk about all this stuff and I never talked about this before and I’ve come to some understandings and one of the things I’ve come to understand is that we were given up for hiding with the best of intentions -- out of nothing but love and care. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But it still caused us problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And it’s I feel a terrible dilemma for my parents that out of the best of intentions we were damned if we did and we were damned if we didn’t and we have this to deal with and it makes me, I was going to use the word angry, the truth 1s I am outraged and livid that I should now have to deal with this stuff in my lifetime that I’m a man who has a hard time relaxing, who does not feel safe and secure in the world, I’m so angry at that and to be gifted with life but to be born at a terrible time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  Do you want to tell me a little bit about how your cousin came to live with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  My cousin Andy’s parents were Cheel, Macheel and his mother Maricha, Marie. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">They went underground but they were caught and they perished in -- I call him my brother Andy, it’s a habit. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">My brother’s father which is not my father perished a few weeks before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He was shot on one of the marches from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">My mother, his mother perished in °44. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I have an album here, of course you can’t see it on tape, that a distant relative in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> made for us where it’s a genealogical tracing of the family and in it we have listings of people and under the listing where it says when they died, where they died we have, well here it says Holocaust to say that he perished -- Judah Zomerplak some of my mother’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">People perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> ; they perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So my brother’s parents perished, his mother in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The adults at the time they were deciding to go underground made this agreement, that whoever survived would take in the children who, God willing, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It turned out that my brother, Andy was taken in by my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  How did they find him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  How did they find him? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They found him -- my father found me, my brother, my cousin Sylvia, my cousin Yanaka. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Just by tracing he found us all, quite remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He found us and I always remember knowing that Andy was my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">What did I know from first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Some time I think when he was ten or eleven years old in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> my parents sat us down and told us the story of his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And I remember -- I don’t know how my brother took it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I have no idea how he took it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I remember going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at night and crying and feeling very sorry for Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">My father came in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and said to me, just because he’s your cousin doesn’t mean we love him less than you which I suppose it’s the transverse saying it doesn’t mean we love you less than him. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And at the time I felt very, very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And I always in my heart felt very sad about my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I now have come to understand it was myself I was feeling sad for, that I was feeling sad for not knowing my foster parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  You were the same age basically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Yeah we were three months different. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He was three months older. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He died in 1979. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He hada massive heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">He, I feel very strongly, was a man who was plagued by what happened during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">When he knew his parents perished and he was adopted and he never, I think metabolized any of that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Unfortunately after the war the advice that my parents and many people like them was given was one of --oh you’ll love your children, you feed them, you take care and everything will be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">No one knew any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">No one knew that there was a psychological dimension that would come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I think my brother stewed on this stuff for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He was a ferocious smoker, nervous habit. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He became a puppeteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He had a <span class="BUILDING">puppet theater</span> and he traveled all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he settled in <span class="REGION">Tulsa Oklahoma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">He was married for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">That didn’t work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He was a hard person. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I say hard in terms of texture. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He lived his life very hard and he was very troubled by it all and unfortunately we didn’t have the advantage of having some kind of therapy or having the right kind of attention that we do now and I always feel bad that Andy died prematurely and that the war reached out and took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">When he died I had the task of calling up my parents late at night who lived in Europe to tell them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I vowed to myself at that time that I would take care of myself so that I would never have to have someone call my parents up and tell them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Every time someone in my family dies, I feel it’s not a matter of people passing on as nature designed it but all the memories of our losses and our feeling betrayed comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It’s not just someone dying, it’s the war again. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And I don’t know how other people like myself experience that. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">This is my experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  What did your parents do then immediately after they got the kids together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">My father got work and even when my parents were hidden underground they talked about they decided they were going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and they were going to teach each other English which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They taught each other a bit of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Cory and Jan learned a little English. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They were going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">My family and Cory and Jan, the people who hid them, stayed very close after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">There are always ironies in history and one of the ironies is that, for our family, it’s been a privilege and a delight to have had these new people in our lives, Cory and Jan, who I’ve always called Tanta Cory and Omi Jan aunt and uncle and whom I’m in touch with and very close to. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">When I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And when I got married in 1982 they came with my parents here so that was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So we were all very close after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">My father went back into the restaurant business. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He worked for a woman whose name was De Haas who had a number of <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and he was her main manager. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">She was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">She survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">She opened up a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It was on the <span class="BUILDING">Centeur Bahn</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> which was a well known <span class="DLF">shopping street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">The <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> was a well- known place. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But while he was working there after the war he still had on his mind he was going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and they did that because we have relatives here. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We had what you would call a matriarch aunt, Rose, Rose Blitz Gossler who in 1945 right after the war came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ro see who was left who she could help. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">At the time there was a conversation between her and my father that when he would come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> she would help him set up in the Deli business which never transpired, which became a little chicken bone 1n the throat for a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So we had family here who sponsored us. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You needed to have a sponsor, someone who could swear that you would not become a ward of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So we sailed here on the New Amsterdam and came here on August 12, 1949 and I remember coming and my Aunt Rose was there to greet us with some other relatives who I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And she mentioned something to me in English that I should run up to this guard, this police officer and say -- and I didn’t know what it was and I went over and blabbed it to him and he smiled and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So my first words in English were a mystery to me except for the police officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">My parents very quickly started to make a life for themselves here, determined to put everything behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And, of course, my parents are people who have had a history before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They’ve had a history that they think of fondly and speak of fondly. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So the war was an interruption, a terrible interruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">For the rest of us who were younger it was our first experience in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">We had nothing to go back to, to draw from, to support us. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So it was different for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They were able to say, let’s build a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Those of us who were younger had some real traumatic problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I understand that some -- we were in some way victims of child abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">We were traumatized children. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I know from my cousin that one of my cousins had a very difficult time in going back with her Mom and Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">She wanted to be back with her foster parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  How old was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  She is two years older than me so at the time she was five. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And there was an incident where I guess she got to be so whiny and nagging and impossible that her mother filled the suitcase, put it on the <span class="DLF">front steps</span> and said, go. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Get with the program or go. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And the rest of us got the message; it was a very serious message. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So we all got with the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">You know it’s a complex thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">You wished that your parents were smarter, were wiser but they were who they were and they tried their very best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Did you ever feel estrangement this whole time in a sense?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  No, I never felt estranged from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The odd thing is my parents did very well by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And I think of them very fondly; I miss my father terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I’m sorry my mother’s living in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we can’t be closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But I know that I grew up as a very angry person. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Right after the war I was hospitalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was hospitalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Let’s see now, three months after the liberation I was hospitalized for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I had I guess what you called chorea or what’s commonly called St. Vitus Dance, I had a nervous disorder. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So clearly I was paying for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I remember being very well taken care of in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic hospital</span> and I remember the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I remember like you see on the TV program the nuns with the giant wings on their heads, real nun, old world nun. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I remember being very well taken care of and then when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a few weeks after we were here my father had a serious stomach operation, ulcer. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">A few months again I also had a nervous breakdown. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So there was stuff going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">There’s the will to survive and get along with it and then there’s the body telling you I can’t take anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">There’s the psyche telling you I can’t take anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I need down time; I need time off. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So I remember my parents doing very well by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I’m not someone who complains about my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But I also know that I grew up as a very angry young man with a terribly sarcastic sense of humor; always saw the dark side of things first; was very politically active in the sixties in the civil rights and war stuff and even in the seventies. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">My anger was coming from my experiences as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I know that when I was born my mother was not able to really take care of me well because she was just a wreck. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">People around me were a wreck filled with fear and dread and I must have taken that in as they say with your mother’s milk even though there was no mother’s milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I had taken that all in and I experienced myself as a very anxious person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Now when you moved to the <span class="REGION">Brighton Beach area</span> were there primarily other refugees in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> or was there-------?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I remember only one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was a Hungarian family with two boys and I heard from my parents that they were in the war too. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But there was never any talk with those families about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We played with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But if there were other refugee families I didn’t know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">People didn’t talk about it to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">You put it behind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">You deny it; you get on with your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And I think now there was also a certain element of shame about it all among other feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">It was like people were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> with their stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beach Haven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I have enjoyable memories of my childhood also being a nervous kid but not a very intense religious quality to our family’s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We would have Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We would set a nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and have a wonderful meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">There was nothing said. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We would celebrate Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">We had a lot of intermarriage family which you have with Jewish families in Europe, a lot of intermarriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Who did your parents associate with once they came here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  They associated with their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">There was my father’s brother Morritz survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">These two brothers took care of each other; they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They paid a terrible price for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">They died, one of heart, one of cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They associated with family. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They didn’t make friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It was something I always found very peculiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I suppose in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> it was that way too. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">There was a large family before the war; your family were your friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">My mother who now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beth Sholom</span> which is a kind of <span class="BUILDING">quasi retirement home</span> has a very nice circle of about four or five women her age who have similar stories who they’re very close with. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It’s very sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">After dinner they sit in each other’s small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and theyll watch TV and have coffee and chat. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And then when it’s time to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> they’ Il kiss each other goodnight and they’Il go to their separate <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And it’s sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It’s not something that she had as a younger woman here. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Her friends were always the other -- sister- in-laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">She had sister-in-law friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  I think that’s typical of the European rather than------but I was wondering since they came out—
ANSWER:  My mother did make friends with the women in her <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">She worked in the garment trade for many years, mostly Italian women. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And she learned to cook very good Italian food from that and she speaks of it very fondly. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">She says the post-war years were some of the best years of her life; I saw the boys grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">She remembers it very fondly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  So you never had any formal Jewish education of any sort?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  No, I was, it’s an interesting story I’m glad you asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">A few months, about two or three months before it was time to have my brother and I bar mitzvahed we had a local rabbi come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and give us rabbi lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And at one point, it was a very rote kind of lesson, we had to “zocher” we had to remember but we didn’t have to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So at one point we said, rabbi what does this mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And he said, it doesn’t matter you don’t need to know, just remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I can date my alienation from Judaism from that day, from that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">A very unwise thing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">There might have been an agenda that was just get the boys to remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Nonetheless it’s not an answer I would give if I were a rabbi that’s for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So I was not a Jewish person until a few years ago when my wife took an interest in Judaism; had us join a local <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> because she wisely understood it was part of the process of me being disaffected. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">At first we would go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> just for the high holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I’d sit in the back with my coat and hat on ready to flee at any time feeling very uncomfortable always feeling like I want to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I would go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> and feel like I want to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And that’s the way I feel right now even saying it, not feeling welcome, not feeling safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I understand now it’s not feeling safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">For us to identify with Judaism was to immediately putting ourselves in touch with everything that was dangerous to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And I at some point regretted very much that not only had those bastards taken our families they now had taken our culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And I was determined to take that culture back within the context of being a 49 year old man living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> in the latter half of the twentieth century swept left and right by secular humanism, being a little bit politically leftist and sympathetic and liberal and feeling strongly about certain issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Within that context I take back my Jewish culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  I think there’s a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for it actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  There is a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The only problem 1s we just realized we joined a rather conservative <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> where the whole service 1s like a Polish steeplechase, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I’m still reading the commentary and they’re finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So I’m sort of shopping around for a little more contemporary enlightened <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Our godson who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Hampton</span> was going to be bar mitzvahed and I was going to be called up to read for the first time and decided well I’d better do this really well not to embarrass him nor myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So Lucy and I, my wife Lucy and I a year before started taking Hebrew lessons just so we could read this. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I could read this short little thing and took Hebrew lessons for about two and a half years so I could read Torah and know what was being said. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And that kind of got us started and every Friday night Lucy and I have Shabbat dinner and we do a blessing and when we’re not too exhausted from the end of the week we’ll read something and have found it very important to have something that separates the work week from rest, to have a moment of grace, to allow ourselves some grace even though the next day, Saturday, we’re still doing things we have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">There are times where I feel I’d like to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> even though I’Il sit there. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I won’t know what’s being talked about but I'll sit there; P’Il read the commentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">There’ll be a Kiddush and I enjoy that. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">It’s hard to lead a Jewish life because all the issues for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I find it very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  When did you get involved with this... you just got involved with the survivor’s group after they had the Children’s Conference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  Yeah, the Children’s Conference was the week of May 5" 1991 and we knew about it almost a year before and I thought at the time I didn’t want to go to this conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I didn’t want to deal with any of this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And then I had started going to therapy shortly before the conference and talking to my therapist about it to help me to understand that it was probably a good thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I talked with my cousins who were determined to go and I said well I'll come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and meet you. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We can have lunch and see each other but I’m not going to the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So we talked and talked and eventually I understood that it was a good thing for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I went to the conference and it was terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I also sort of count for my conscious depression to that time and know that my whole life I’ve been depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But it’s all very much open and on the surface right now and I give it a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It’s peculiar because there are times when people will see me and they’ Il say, hi Jack how are you. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And the question while only a second long feels like a thousand light years which gives me enough time to think do I tell them how I’m really doing, do I be sociable, do I know this person well enough? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Because I don’t feel I’m doing well, you know but understand it’s a social question but now there are people who know my situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I was at a dinner a month ago with some old friends and half the people there were therapists. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And at some point this old friend who hadn’t seen me in a while actually a friend of my wife said, so Jack so how are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Are you doing any good art work, any art, what’s happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I said, well actually I see my therapist twice a week I’m very depressed, the bottom of the <span class="BUILDING">art market</span> has fallen and there’s not much happening, and you? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And there’s dead silence and it’s sort of like a Woody Allen scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  I guess they didn’t invite you anymore, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  No, they invited my wife back to the chorus. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">It’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">There’s a Brookline chorus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  I was just kidding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  I know but you know it was important for me to say it, to give an answer not to sidestep it because for people like myself who were younger during the war the matter of having a voice is crucial. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And the matter of being able to feel our experience was authentic 1s crucial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  I think the truth of it there are so few children, Jewish children, who survived the war, so few -- and then were reunited with their family or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">There are others who were just broken at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  I think that the numbers something like 25,000 people went underground and something like 16,000 perished were betrayed being underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">The statistics are so telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> before the war you had including 25,000 Jewish German refugees you had 140,000 Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">After the war you had something between 15 and 10 or 25,000, terrible attrition rate. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">It makes me feel very badly about Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">In the 1960’s I traveled a lot to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I would work here for a while. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="727">'d save my money. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I’d go live in Europe; I’'d bum around. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Those were the years you could do that and see Europe and I was not that aware of my feelings of all of this stuff but as time goes by I find myself very angry about Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you about your Dutch identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">What did your parents do when you got here? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Did you sort of sublimate? </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Did you speak Dutch at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or have Dutch customs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  We spoke both at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I am very good with languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I lost my accent very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">What’s amusing is that in being with this group of hidden children who meets -- we meet once a month- 1am one of the few people who doesn’t have an accent and what I enjoy is being with these people because this is a circle of people I would have been in had things been better, been different. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So it gives me a sense of what it was like for my parents, for my family and I enjoy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So we came here and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had -- I want to say hello to Mrs. Harris who in the third grade was so wonderful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">She helped me to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">We spoke Dutch and English at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but of course we started to speak more English. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the first time in 1965 as did my parents although we went on separate trips -- we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> but we went on our separate trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And I ended up living in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for a year in 1965 because I wanted to learn Dutch again. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">You know I studied French in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I like languages and I wanted to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">But as to the matter of Dutch identity it’s very complex for me because being a European American I like that I have -- whatever it means to be a European Jew I like that because it gives me a certain perspective about what it means to live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in this time in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">On the other hand I find some of the presumptuousness and arrogance of the Europeans about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> really shallow and I’ve always sort of understood <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is the European peasant’s dream come true. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And the only difference between <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and Europe is maybe a hundred years. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But the more I’m in touch with what I feel about my experiences the less happy I am with Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I feel we have been wretchedly betrayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  Your parents never gave you that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Do you think they felt that too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  My parents never -- we never talked about 1n such a national context of saying Europe betrayed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it was Hitler, 1t was Dutch collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">But you can take any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in Europe and it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">What I also find interesting is that what the European Christian community is something that the Europeans have been doing to people of color all over the world for a few hundred years. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">What the Germans did in <span class="REGION">southwest Africa</span> , what the Dutch did in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> and what the Belgians did in the <span class="COUNTRY">Congo</span> , what the English did and what the French did they did it to everybody else who was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And when it happened in their own homeland all of a sudden it became a terrible dark enigma about Hitler and Hitlerism and I really do attribute it -- the little that I know about history -- that it was a European phenomenon and the groundwork was laid by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , by the <span class="BUILDING">Christian church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And I mean people have to own up to that, they have to own up to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  Can I ask you about your art? </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Do you feel that in any way your art manifests some of your 9
ANSWER:  Well actually it does in so far as that my art has nothing to do with my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">My art is a complete denial of my experience and it is such an enigma to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">My artistic voice does not in any way include my experience and I see that as a function of denial. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It perplexes me. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And sometimes, you know some morning II] wake up and say boy I wish I could really express all that stuff in my art. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But then I think of oh well but then I would be so literal, literal or pedantic or rhetorical and I don’t want to be that. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">It’s not what I draw on for my art. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">My art what I draw on is from my beauty, my love of beauty, the love of what’s beautiful in the world, the love of what’s beautiful between people. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I also think there are aesthetic problems with dealing with horrors of such magnitude and I’m not the person to do it so I leave it alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  Have you looked at any other so-called Holocaust artists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  Yes, well I have looked -- there’s a book of art from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , things that were painted on <span class="DLF">walls</span> and I’m absolutely struck by how powerful it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">It’s different than people today who will make art that’s about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">It does not strike a chord in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I also in some way -- Elie Wiesel talks somehow about that you can’t make art out of it, how in some way it’s so inexplicable that all art will fall short and I think even successful Holocaust Shoah art falls short. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">To maintain a certain kind of integrity 1t would have to, it would have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I always felt for myself that art is about redemption and I don’t think......
QUESTION:  It’s very idealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">A; No, it’s not idealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">It’s as I think that the way in which the creative process functions in each of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">You draw on aspirations, you draw on hope, you draw on a sense of all things in their connectedness rather than being dispert. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And you look for the sacred, what’s sacred in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">This is I think what motivates art and other people of course have another sense of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And for now the Shoah is I don’t think there’s a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for redemption right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I mean I understand that in our group that we meet once a month we have been talking about among other things about how civilization has a need to deny and has a need to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">It’s a shameful period and it needs to forget and it will do this in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">One way will be the most banal expression of people who absolutely deny it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Then there is the matter of having perpetrators and victims be seen as equivocal in some way sort of like the Blitburg visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">We’re all victims of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Well that’s so but that’s beside this point and that over time who knows how the story of this thing will be told. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We can witness the experience of the African Americans in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the horror of that and how that’s already been glossed over. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I think that civilizations have a need to forget their shame and this is why I insist upon telling my story and say yes to being interviewed to anyone who’s willing to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  Can I ask you some more questions maybe about your parents, about their personalities? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">If we're going to include them in our project I would need to..... I think I’ll switch the tape though. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">We’re on the second tape of the interview with Jack Trompettor. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We’re talking about his parents now. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Which parent would you like to start with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  Well I can tell you some things about them relative to the war experiences that are interesting in terms of personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">One is that my mother talks of having found my father so very appealing when they were younger because he was a quiet fellow and she liked that about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">It turns out that during the war he went through this personality change and he became a gregarious chatty chap. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He’s a man who loved to talk to strangers as I am and he was very sociable, he was fun, he was easy to get along with. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">So he went through a real personality change. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">My mother is more of a worrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">She does the worrying for us and it’s sort of an unfair responsibility I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">It’s enough to be a mother but then to have to do the worrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And she - well it’s hard to really talk about her without defaming her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  Other people have had this experience too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Well you know we accept our mothers and fathers as gods and forget that they are beautifully human. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">What can I say about my parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I don’t really know except that I know in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> my father worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I'd see him come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and after dinner he’d sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TV</span> and within five minutes he was asleep, he was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">On Sundays he would go with the other men in the family and sometimes some of the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">then we would go watch the soccer games. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">All the ethnic clubs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> played soccer with each other and we’d do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And they belonged to the Holland-American sporting club which would have a New Year’s party. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Which would have functions, events. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">So they kept within their Dutch circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Any friends that they made outside of the family were still Dutchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">In some ways I regret that they did not branch out more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  It sounds to me that like for example your father must have been extremely strong-willed to have made the decision not to register and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Yes, you know I experienced my father as a very ordinary person and I don’t mean that “ordinaire”. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I mean just -- he was just a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">But he 1s very creative in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">In the short haul he’s very creative. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">When a crisis would come up he would be real quick and he would be really on the case and I know when he and my mother went underground my mother did most of the hemming and hawing of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I say of course, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And he had to really convince her as well as her brother’s letter that said don’t bring the red <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> -- had to convince her they had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So she would do a lot of hemming and hawing but she’s a very expressive person. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">My mother is the one who I’ve done much of my talking with. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">We are both connected very emotionally in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It’s been troublesome as well because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">My father P’ve experienced a little more distantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Guess it’s very typical in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I always experienced them both as being very supportive but there are things I never really got into with my father that I would get into with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">My mother would have wonderful provocative arguments and she was the more expressively emotional one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  I know its hard having observed your parents, interacting with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Do you know how they were generally thought of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  My parents in the family have had a good reputation, very good reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">When I talk with my cousins and they talked about my parents they always talked about how friendly and sweet and thoughtful they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And this is how I’ve experienced them, as a thoughtful people who were very practical at life and also had placed a premium on being a decent person. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">There was a clear message about you had to be an ethical person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  And they behaved that way as well, it seems?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Is there anything else maybe that you know about their childhoods or their youth or their ...? </span><span class="sentence" id="843">You say they were involved in these social democratic -- was that a teenageerhood already or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Yeah, sixteen, seventeen on. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">You know you’re in a particular class and your social life at that time was very much involved in political groups, the young people’s socialist league or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And what it meant was it provided a social life with a kind of minimal political context for young people and sometimes it would serve the purpose of grooming more seriously politically committed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But it was also neighborhood stuff, it was neighborhood stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">My parents lived with a lot of relatives as did many people then and they enjoyed that . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They did a lot of their playing and socializing with those cousins.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  Did they have any hobbies or music interests or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  Let’s see now, no, I know that during the war my father got involved in marquetry, wood marquetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">During the thirties in Europe it was very popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">You’d get marquetry sets. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Like let’s say here its Scrabble or hula-hoop which dates me. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But there it was marquetry and during the war Jan Van Nomberg and my father managed to get hold of these marquetry sets and make these little pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They were copies of famous old masters and my mother has my dad’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">It’s in my dowry. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I get 1t when it’s my turn and it’s a replication of a famous Vermeer painting of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where Vermeer lived and it’s remarkable because the brick is all these small pieces of wood and the mortar in between are all these tiny, tiny little splints of pieces of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They did this during the war when they were underground to keep themselves from going cuckoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I don’t know of any other habit, hobbies my father had. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">My mother liked to sing when she was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I know I grew up loving opera and I attribute that to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">These people worked a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">The message here was work, work so.... And I am an artist and that’s my work and other people would consider that a hobby so what other people would consider a hobby I took on as a major - aS an occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your own experience or that of your family, your relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">ANSWER:  Well at the expense of sounding whiny, I would say that my family like many, many people got screwed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and my parents had to start from scratch again and never could quite build it up to where they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They worked very hard in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and they did well for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I do marvel actually at my parents the ability to go into hiding, provide for themselves and survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">When I was in my teens and going through my rebellion I pooh-poohed my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">What did they know? </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I knew much more than they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And now, of course, I think what a little snot-nose I was to think that. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They had to live through and make life decisions through something I have not had to and hope to God I and no one else will ever have to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And they were ordinary people, simple people and they rose to the occasion and the people that hid them were ordinary human beings and they rose to the occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Those were the heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">My parents were the heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The people that hid them were the heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And the stories they tell of what they did during the war to survive 1s remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">My mother taught Cory how to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">What they did -- they would get clothing and they would take it apart and remake things out of it and they would sell or exchange that for foodstuffs. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And when my parents were hidden underground no one on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , of course, knew they were being hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The parents of Cory knew but not her younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It was too dangerous to let people know. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And Jan would get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">He had those wide pants at the time, very wide flair pants, very popular then, like bell-bottoms in some way and they sewed these cloth bags to the inside of their pants that they would fill with foodstuffs and he would bicycle <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They also had to be careful because they couldn’t trade for food that would be evident that there was more than two people in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> eating so it had to be all done in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and as my mother tells it they were never hungry during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">They always had enough foodstuffs. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And she would take great pleasure going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and looking at the shelves and seeing what food they were able to store.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  Interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  It is interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I know I lived on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> from 1977 to 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Actually I did farming in <span class="REGION">New England</span> from 1973 to 1980 when I lived with someone and we raised, we had a milk cow, we raised hogs, we raised chickens, we raised sheep, we raised a lot of our own foodstuffs. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I would go down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and I would put up forty quarts of applesauce, sixty quarts of tomatoes, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freezer</span> filled with meat, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freezer</span> filled with vegetables, cords of wood stacked up -- very New England. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I would go look at all this and stand there like a proud man with my hand in my suspenders looking at it and not at the time understanding what was going on was some kind of replication of some need that my parents went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">My parents went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 1972 because they wanted to retire and they could do it there rather than here and it was also the year that I went to live in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> during the summer and ended up staying there and ended up actually having left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and shortly after ended up in a farm situation and I do wonder now how I[ had replicated my war experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">In a way it makes me feel very bad that my agenda was so unconscious that my going into this <span class="DLF">farm</span> and farming was a matter of going into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I had a big beard, I had long hair, I looked very different than I do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I was in hiding and it makes m feel very badly that I still had to act this out and it happened at the same time as my parents decided to go back to Europe and again it was a kind of a split with my family, a separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I understand it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  What motivated them to actually -- you said because they could retire there now. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Have you decided to continue this interview after all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I want to read this little piece, that is what my wife and I translated from my mother’s journal that she spent seven years writing about her and the family’s wartime experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And what’s interesting is she has said that in writing this it made her feel much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">She’s really the only one in her family that even talks about this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">For years my brother and I even after we moved out of our parents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when we’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to visit would ask them about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And inevitably every time we got together the conversation would come back to that and there were questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">My brother and I always had to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">At one point we finally decided let’s get Mom a tape recorder and see if she’d really do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And she spent seven years writing this stuff down. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And it was done without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , without a personal computer, just by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And she got so involved with it that when Cory wanted to go out with her shopping or something Celene wouldn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">She really wanted to do this and complete it and as I said she felt in a way that a burden was taken off her chest. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">There’s one little piece I want to read that could give you an idea of what it was like at the time that my parents made the decision to go underground and to provide and look for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">On the fifteenth of November Eddie (which was my mother’s other brother) visited us with great sadness because of what had happened to Father, Mother and our brother Jack. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">During this visit he told us he had an underground address for Dad and myself and a separate one for you, Jack. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It’s written for you because this whole manuscript was written for my brother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So that’s the form it takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Very distressed with the idea of parting from our baby, Eddie tried to convince us that your chances, Jack were better without us. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">If we were captured he explained at least you might survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">He also knew it would be easier to find a separate <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a couple without children. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They would not bring to the underground family the additional burden and security risk of children crying or needing medical attention and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">All night Eddie talked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">What an extraordinary demand -- give up our three month old child to perfect strangers and without opportunities to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We had no idea how long such an arrangement would have to last, a month, half a year, longer, who knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">The next day we talked with my brother Maritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">In the serious way that’s so typical of him he asked Dad and me to consider the following : Imagine the German police catching you, he said, this could happen at any moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">The baby will fall into their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Wouldn’t you rather have a child with Ollie and me (Ollie was his wife) until Eddie takes them to a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Here was a chance so many people wanted but had no opportunity of getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">How could we pass it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">We felt that no matter what we did we would be doomed if we didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Already the families of several of our brothers and sisters had been torn apart by arrests and deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">A few months ago, Case, the husband of Dad’s sister, Bepe, had been taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Westerbork</span> leaving Bepe at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone with their two year- old daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="937"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> was located in <span class="REGION">Northern Holland</span> and the Jews were sent from there to the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Maritz Trompettor, who was my father’s brother, had been in the same camp for half a year by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">His wife, Femma and their daughters were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">The <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the Green Police. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">They captured the Jewish infants and sent them with their mothers to be gassed or destroyed in one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">But Femma protected herself and her daughters and then found underground addresses for each of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">This is my Aunt Femma who died a year ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">She was very active in finding <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">She was a very brave and very strong and feisty woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">The thing is many people were brave and feisty and strong and everything but in some way it was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">It was luck that you survived but it didn’t necessarily mean that you were lucky or that being lucky meant you were better than anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">My brother Maritz and his family were still intact and living at the <span class="DLF">Transvaalstraat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">My mother’s brother Maritz was born in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because his parents took a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and he was born there so he had dual citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">He had British and Dutch citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">He eventually ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> was not an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> and because he was a British citizen they didn’t kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">It also allowed for his wife Ollie to bring food packages to him which helped him to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Eddie, another brother, because he was involved with the resistance moved around from one temporary <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">He never went permanently underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Indeed with his pure blue eyes and curly blond hair he thought he would be taken for a German rather than a Dutch Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Brazen as he was he had been riding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> filled with Germans and these experiences gave him this idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Of course he did not know that in time he would be the victim of betrayal. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">He was betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">My close friend Marie which is my brother’s/cousin’s mother which is Andy’s mother, another of Dad’s sisters was still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with her husband, Cheel and their six month old infant Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Like us they lived with all the worries and fears of keeping Andy out of the hands of the pack of thieves. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">By now Dad’s other sister, Judith, her husband and their four year old daughter Laney had been underground for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">With great difficulty and sadness we struggled over our decision to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">There was not even a guarantee that all would go well underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Inasmuch as no guarantee was to be found with any choice we made we finally decided to go ahead with Eddie’s plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">He promised that within a week we would be told all the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">This was the best of the worst of situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Maritz’s wife Ollie also had to agree with the arrangement because she would be also responsible for caring for our son, me. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">No one knew for how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">It could take two days, it could take a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">But Ollie agreed without talking to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">It was good enough for her that my brothers wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We have always been grateful to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Ollie died two and a half months ago and I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a letter saying something like this about what a decent person she was and how we owe our thanks to her and I wrote this letter as -- 1t was ostensibly a condolence letter but I wanted to say something to her daughters about what a fine person she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We cared a great deal for our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Sisters, brothers and children were heavy on our hearts and particularly the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">What did one do with the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Grandma and Grandfather Trompettor were still living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">They were fortunate for the moment because Shuls, one of their sons, one of my father’s brothers, and his family lived nearby allowing them to help his parents through thick and thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">But with his loving attention to them and his recent service period away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> (he had to serve in the army) he hadn’t been able to find an underground address. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">The old people understood that for them life was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">One sees this now on the photographs taken of them for their identity papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Even if they went underground, which seldom happened, their chance for survival was very slim. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">As long as the war continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves, most likely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Often enough there was talk of the underground and so with great grief they began to live with it (meaning the children going underground). </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Thus was something we simply could not continue to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">If one became too sensitive and afraid then one might let an opportunity go by. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">We grew resolute. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">We did not tell anyone about our plan other than Father and Mother Trompettor. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">You, Jack and I had recently visited them and I did not expect them to say goodbye to us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">From their gestures at our departure I saw that for them it was a real goodbye, not just a good-day until the next time. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Clearly they suspected something. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Every evening for years Dad visited them for a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Now he went to tell them of our decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">How does one present such a sad prospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Like their other children we too kept the details for ourselves for the sake of security. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">You took nobody into your confidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">This was what the bad society had made of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Later as it turned out all those who were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> except for Uncles Jules eventually went underground but it consoled us little to learn that we were not the only ones who had to leave parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">This is a very telling piece which always perplexes me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">For me the leaving was not so difficult because my parents were not here anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">This is my mother talking because her parents were already taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">What I have left if they were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Dad asked himself this question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">No good answer was found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Today, forty years later, I do not think I would have made this choice again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">The twentieth of November 1942 arrives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">It is early in the morning and I am <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone when Eddie comes to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">We must be ready before eight o’clock that night, he says, to begin with the first part of our journey into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">As we had originally agreed he himself--------- (let’s see if I can find the other piece of that). </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Eddie himself would bring us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Everything was planned that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Jackie, that’s me, would be picked up by my brother Maritz at seven o’clock in the evening and from thereon a place would be found in the <span class="BUILDING">children’s house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neimachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">This was just as Eddie said it would happen from the agreed upon plans made earlier on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">We were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the <span class="BUILDING">children’s house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">We did just this even though in this time this amount of money was a large amount for working class people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">It was organized so that we would have a particular amount with us and Eddie would hold on to the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">In case something went wrong with us there would still be enough money for a definite time to pay the kinder <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">In the beginning we could know if we had enough money or not for the duration of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">We naively thought it would be possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver Kike the neighbor and I delivered our household goods to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with the help of her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">This is a neighbor who was very friendly with my parents who agreed to buy their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> so my parents could raise money and they knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">When you went underground and you left you couldn’t leave abruptly because then immediately someone would be on your tail so my parents planned this over time so they could slowly leave.. They would leave someone paying some of their bills and it would be months before it was realized that they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And my mother has often talked about how she felt she had to be like a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">She had to think like a criminal because the law was in the hands of the criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">She as an ordinary person had to think like that to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Dad was quickly warned at work I do not know by whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">At four o’clock he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which was very unusual for Thursday when he usually came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about eight o’clock or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">He just told his boss he had to go away for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Because it was so busy on Thursdays this boss told him to be quick and come back as soon as possible but Dad knew better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He then went for the last time to his mother and father who were in a dejected mood and not without reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They had just before found out that their daughter Judith, her husband and child, Yope and Laney were betrayed and handed over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">We will never know if the Trompettor grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still with her benefactor having gotten away from her executioners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">This is my cousin Laney who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I’m almost absolutely certain they did not know otherwise we would have heard it from Uncle Jules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">For Dad at the moment while this was indeed a grim message he tried not to be disheartened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">On the contrary this news of his sister strengthened him in his resolve to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">In answer to your question about their character. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">You never really know the full depth I suppose of your character until something extraordinarily intervenes and then if you’re lucky you rise to the occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Dad also told his parents what we were going to do that night but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">This was the last time that Dad was ever again to be with his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Here was the new episode between parents and children finished under the saddest of circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Still to come were many more moments of separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told me that what he had just learned from his parents about his sister and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I felt very sad but now realized that we had come this far and we definitely had to continue with our plans, the sooner the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And this of course then is my mother’s moment when she too becomes resolute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">We ate something and got dressed as if we were going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">We put on our best clothing because you never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Seven o’clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brother Maritz came to take Jackie away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">What a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Would we ever see you again? </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">We embraced you; it had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">It was for us to say the least the only chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">We had to try but how do you do something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Who gives you the strength to hand over your three month old child a bundle that you love so much and have learned every gesture in those three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">When we gave you to Uncle Maritz Zomerplaag we knew there would be a place prepared for you in the Catholic children’s home. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Later as it turned out we found out it was a non-denominational. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Quaker house</span> where the director took in various children but mostly those in Catholic families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">My brother Eddie found that he made more of an impression on us when he said it was a <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I surmised this at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">It did indeed make a better impression on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Eddie said that it would still take a few days before there would be a permanent <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Later we learned that those few days turned into a month but it was a good thing that we didn’t know that at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">In those four weeks of waiting you were almost a fatality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I will return to this later. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1065">This is where I talked about that). </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">It’s remarkable to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">It helps to explain what I feel about my anxiety and insecurity in the world that as a baby I took in all this near destruction of stuff and from what we know now about children take in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">It was our wish to survive this drama with Jack back with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Therefore it was necessary to arrive at our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> safely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">This wish was for us so strong and so consumed us that it became for us the strength needed to give you over to fulfill this unbelievable and horribly sad task. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Without exaggeration from that moment on we thought about you every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I would like to read a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I don’t know if there’s a......
QUESTION:  We have more tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I read this to give you a sense possibly of what it was like for my parents and for me and what people lived with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Now we were again alone without you.. What torment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Do not think that it is easy to write about this now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">To imagine that so many parents had to go through the same and even worse including Marie Cheel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">When they had to take you, Andy, with the best of intentions of getting you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Where your parents brought you we did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">This was logical since we were already underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Later I will write about some of the details, our dear departed son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">My mother finished this -- was writing the story at the time my brother died so it changes-- what do we call that the transitive.....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1084">QUESTION:  The tense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">ANSWER:  The tense, the transitive chicken, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">QUESTION:  With regard to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">As soon as Maritz took Jackie out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we too went on our way to the <span class="BUILDING">Umstel train station</span> just as we had planned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">This took ten minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> on the largest part of our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ’s possessions and most of our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Obviously they must not have had their yellow star on because they could not have been out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">In the meantime Dad had left a half-year’s rent money behind with our landlord. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">The landlord knew we were going away but not when. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">If this helped us we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">It did give us the idea that we would say the lease not be looked at for six months although certainly not out of dispute with the landlord although betrayal or discovery was always naturally a possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">In any case later on we heard of the first raid of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that it was sealed up by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Thus we were not searched for in the first raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">From this we conclude that paying the landlord that way we did serve our purposes well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I would like to read about when my father found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I feel I need to have my voice back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That’s the problem with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">My brother and I were instrumental in getting my mother to do this and it means a lot to me and I’m very pleased she did it but in reading it, it also pushes my button about what about me -- now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Dad felt it was now time for him to begin his own search for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">We are reading now about the part where my parents have been liberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look for whatever children are still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">We had no idea how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">We had no guidance but our patience was up and we could not wait for information that would inform us about what happened with you and Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Because of the behavior of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any action making known that during the war-time they had hidden a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Many people like them were attached to the children in their care, very understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">The family De Chot presumed that Dad and I were no longer alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">We now know that in our situation regarding you that you would have then been returned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">What happened during the war too is people did get attached to their children and there were many legal cases in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> after the war where the families who survived had to go to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to get the children back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">The nature of some of these cases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was through the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">There was no doubt about it, that’s how you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">My mother feels embarrassed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">She thinks it’s shameful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">She prefers I not saying anything about it but the fact is that’s how people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Gentile families who did not want to return their Jewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible parents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Many of the people who hid the children also had a religious agenda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">They felt they needed to convert these children and it wasn’t always a self-serving sentiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">It was also the sentiment of how to save the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">To convert them would be to save them, so it was mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">The reason there was a high percentage of Dutch Jewish children who were able to go underground was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">The Jews were known as the people of the Book and for many of the Protestants in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> they took their bible literally, it’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">With Andy it would have turned out differently because his parents were no longer alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">More about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Dad didn’t want to wait any more while the information just dribbled in and as I said went out on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">After enquiring he found out where to go to the military authorities and get a special pass that allowed him to hitch rides on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">There was no other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">You didn’t have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , you didn’t have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subways</span> , you didn’t have zip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">This meant only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army vehicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">The fact is there simply wasn’t any other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Still this meant quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Again Dad left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with nothing but a little money for necessities which themselves weren’t easy to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">The military authorities gave Dad very good advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">The told him he must begin his search north of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is in the middle divided by a bunch of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Because there was known that in the province Overeisel there were children who had been bought for hiding so the story goes light haired children above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> which wasn’t true of you at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">What Celene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark haired Jewish children would go to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> where most of the people were Catholic and were darker and the lighter skinned, lighter haired Jewish people would go to the north because there were Protestants who were lighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So Dad began with the purpose in front of his eyes, good or bad from one empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army truck</span> or another finally ending up in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naivadol</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Overeisel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">We had never heard of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Once in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naivadol</span> Dad immediately went to <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">There he spoke to several bureaucrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">One of them, Mr. Bucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries Andy’s foster mother on the large <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naivadol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">The man knew that there was a young boy that had been hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">When he arrived at Mrs. De Fries’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> Dad was allowed in and saw to his stunned surprise a little boy of whom he though thought this could well be Andy, his nephew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">He had the family face and the age was also right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Dad spoke with Mrs. De Fries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">He explained his relationship telling her his name which at the moment was unknown to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">After a while and for different reasons she understood that Dad was the brother of the mother of this child who she had taken over under her protection and who she was very fond of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Dad was very lucky to have found Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">For Mrs. De Fries this was not a happy day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Dad could see that it would not be easy to get Andy from her but that’s a tale apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">It got to be late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper and slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">The few hours that were left Dad played with Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">Andy sat on Dad’s lap and began to play with his ear lobe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">This was a habit that Dad’s younger brother Yope one out of eight brothers and sisters always did as a little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Mr. Bucker from <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> also knew to tell Dad that a few kilometers between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naivadol</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaino</span> stood an old small <span class="DLF">farm</span> where there was also a young boy brought underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">He suggested that Dad should check this <span class="DLF">farm</span> out because that in any event he left Mrs. De Fries and planned to return for Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">She actually didn’t give Dad any indication that she understood that she had to be separated from Andy at some point in the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Dad departed from Andy with mixed feelings from this complicated situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">It was early in the morning when Dad continued his search for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">He had to travel the long kilometers on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">He often said to me how he walked and walked and in the evening dead tired arrived somewhere on the side of a <span class="DLF">road</span> in the village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">He rang the bell of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">It was already dark and about ten o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">He waited for someone to answer the <span class="DLF">door</span> which didn’t happen right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">They were people who were used to going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> early and they were by then fast asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Dad kept ringing the bell and finally a man stuck his head out of the <span class="DLF">attic window</span> and asked what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">In the hope that the sound of a child crying was your crying Dad screwed up his courage to begin a conversation with this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">He told the man who he was and why he had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">They didn’t plan to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> right away answering Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">The child’s parents died and that’s why we took him through the intervention of our pastor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">At this point Dad asked to be let in, in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">He wanted them to know who he was by comparing something he had with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Oh I guess from reading this I see that they brought me to him that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I thought that he slept over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Dad was allowed in and right away showed the man a lamb’s wool baby shirt because a similar one had been left with the baby boy when he was sent underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">This was from the lamb’s wool bathing suit that they had made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">The organization that provided contact with underground <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> had told the family to save it in case the child had to be brought to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Luckily in your situation this advice was heeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">After comparing the two pieces this was evidence enough that the truth was being spoken here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Only then did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of about two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Dad saw in the blink of an eye that 1t was his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">What a moment it must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">It was and is to value how these people didn’t clam up but in one night were made 100% certain before believing something of the parental bond that was being talked about here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">This is understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Here I could write some things but that I won’t and don’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Pll leave that to imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">The truth is I don’t know what she’s talking about here and I'd really be curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">What Dad told me about this after he took you in his arms that is not to be described except by Dad himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who played a large role in your and our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">After an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to sleep there overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">You and the family slept upstairs while Dad was given a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hay mattress</span> and a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">From everything that Dad could see these people were very simple farmers, in fact poor people who notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold themselves together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was eighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">His wife who was also in her sixties wore a wig which was very unusual in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They had an unmarried son who was about twenty eight years old who could be mistaken for forty and an unmarried young daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">When I saw them later I could see that they were a very stiff but decent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">When she says stiff she means that they were Dutch Reformed, very conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">The people were as good for you as they could be because with them there was also great hunger which was readily apparent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">They had one horse and a few chickens left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the <span class="REGION">land</span> for other farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">For this he would every day get a plate of oatmeal and once in a while an egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">You Jack, would sit by him and he would share his oatmeal and egg with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Mrs. De Chot told how she took apart one of her bedspreads and used the thread to make a coverall for you because all of your clothes were too small. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">She also said she cut the tips of your shoes off so that they would still fit. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Laughter) Remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">You know I haven’t read this in a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">This can be seen from a photo that she made of you, her son and herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">When I look at the photo and when I had first seen it I had the impression that she had made this coverall for the occasion of the photograph for which she derived great pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I’ve never seen this photo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Not knowing that she would have to give you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Later at our first meeting she said that she never would have given you up had it not been your real parents who claimed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">She had planned to have you baptized but our appearance had prevented this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Too bad I would have been covered there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">There was no doubt at all that these people were very fond of you and the son played the role of father even more so than the older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">This became quite clear later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">The family came out of a Reform Protestant background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">They were very formal and lived just like Mrs. De Fries with her bible on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Almost everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Overeisel</span> lived like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I just want to interrupt this reading by saying something that I have found out in the last half a year that there was in fact a group in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , there was a group of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were instrumental in providing <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> for Jewish children like myself and this group was called the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the anonymous holding company which is a wonderful surrealistic title I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And my cousin Yanika from <span class="REGION">California</span> has been receiving this information and recently sent me an article about an older man who is very pivotal in this group who was captured and killed and in the article there is a list of children’s names of their name, the date they were born and where they were hidden and my name is in there and I saw it and it was a remarkable experience to get this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I called my cousin Yanika and I said to her I got this, this is wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And she says to me what did you feel like when you saw your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And I said well the truth is I felt wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">It confirms all these things and I said and how did you feel and she said well I wept and I wept and I wept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">She is 57 so she’s older than me and she remembers our grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">She remembers going out every day when she was hidden underground waiting for her parents to come back so she has that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">But for me it was a remarkable experience to see my name Isaac Trompettor and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Overeisel</span> which is the province where I was and then a question mark next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Overeisel</span> that may mean we don’t know where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Overeisel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">It was a stunning experience for me to see that and it was all the result of me spending the last years of searching this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I know my parents were very resistant to that for a long time and I feel very vindicated that I pursued this and stayed with it, that I got this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">It’s very important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I would emphatically encourage other people who have similar or like stories to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">When you do find out real documented pieces of what you’ve always heard in your family it’s emotionally very fulfilling and powerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">QUESTION:  I imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Do you want to choose maybe one or two more things to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">A? </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Ill just read this last page. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">In the few days that it was necessary for Dad to stay there, there was so much conversation from which Dad had heard that in the beginning there was also another young boy about twelve years old who they also hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Mrs. De Chot had noticed that when she was away and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to you, you were crying and the young boy had frightened you and the crying got worse instead of better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">It turned out that he would light the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and put me head first into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I’d rather not believe it but it was enough for them to bring this boy somewhere else because they wanted to keep you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">So I can imagine seeing this other young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">He had to go somewhere else and who knows what happened to this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I think this accounts for some of my having a nervous breakdown after the war, being fricasseed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Now it was time for Dad to figure out how to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">He knew that I didn’t know what was going on nor did he have an opportunity to inform me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">You know there were no phones then that were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">The next morning Dad went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , spoke with the pastor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">What Dad told him was sufficient enough for Dad to take you without any official authorization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> had a lot of influence with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">You could go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and make it clear to them you were the parent and the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> would go to the people and talk to them and convince them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">From there we went to the local military authority who provided him with a transportation pass so that when transport went south both of you could go on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">It took four That's my Mom.jpgThat's my Mom.jpgdays before an empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came your way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Those four days were actually very necessary because you two got to know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">The morning when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> arrived Dad and you left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilburg</span> promising the De Chots to keep in touch and he would let them know how you were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Naturally we kept our word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">We were in touch and visited those people up until we went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">It was also the time at least according to my parents that they got to be very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I suspect that this was not entirely so and maybe what my parents had to flush out in order to make the necessary separation from these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">I mean it’s complex and subtle stuff with this last little chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">What Dad clearly remembers about this trip was that as long as the ride took, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he got wet, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">You also cried often during the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">How could it be otherwise sitting in the back for hours with the feeling of wet pants, no food or drink, as well as the crowding of many other people around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">While you possibly had been so used to the quiet all of a sudden such a huge change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I have often thought about this especially if I had been the one to carry you instead of Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I have also often thought about how I would have felt if I had been the one to see you first at the De Chots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">To understand that I could see you in front of me to spoil you and take you with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">What would that have felt like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">This will always be a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">The other question that should always be a question and unfortunately didn’t get addressed in our family was what was it like for me to be adopted by my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Powerful stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">QUESTION:  Indeed, well I thank you again. </span>
