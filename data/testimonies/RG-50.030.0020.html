<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  David, we are going to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And I would like for you to give us your full name, where you were born and when you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name is David Bergman, spelled B-E-R-G-M-A-N. And I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian Mountains</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bochov</span> .' </span><span class="sentence" id="3">It... at that time when I was born, it belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Was a province of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I was born on May 3rd, 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Can you give us some of your recollections of your early childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Well, the early childhood was a very happy life for me and my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I had a younger brother, older sister, mother, father, grandparents; and we were very close knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And uh...he made suits for people coming from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We had one of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">tailor shops</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my mother, who was a seamstress, made the shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And I was just busy running around having a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And that we had uh what's considered here...it's a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We had...uh we didn't, I should say, have the comforts like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We didn't have running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We didn't have...uh central heating. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> from heating, for heating; and uh for the water, we had a <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> was in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> several hundred feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So I...where I lived, I considered that normal. (</span><span class="sentence" id="22">Laughing) I didn't think that you're supposed to have these kind of conveniences. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So we didn't uh...uh think that there should be any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And uh...my...uh I went both to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> and <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Now uh actually when I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was really...1s when the first uh--say in '39--the first sensing of the beginning of what anti-Semitism is really like. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I remember, it was on a Saturday once. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And that's after the Hungarians marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The Hungarians, until 1939 that <span class="REGION">province</span> was under Czechoslovakia rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And we had a Czech officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We had a two-family home; he lived on the lower flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And all of a sudden, he disappeared just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Just like over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the Hungarians just marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we were forced to...uh pledge allegiance to the new Hungarian regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And as soon as they walked in, within a few days... I happened to be on a Saturday at my grandfather's place; and he had a eruv. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I don't know if you know; a eruv 1s a <span class="DLF">guide wire</span> that sets a <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> as far as we can walk on the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And the first thing they did is, they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and ripped off that <span class="DLF">wire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So that was the first harassment that I actually seen by the Hungarian Nazis--showing their muscles, really, what they can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then afterwards, we were told that we could no longer go into ' Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veliky-Bo_kov</span> , or Russ: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veliktye-Bychkov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Located in the Transcarpathian Oblast of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">cheder, legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That was forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So we had to go illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then we would have a look out for the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So we'd take turns. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Whenever the police came, they always were in pair. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They had their green hats and a little feather on their head like, so they were recognizable from a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So as soon as they...we saw them coming, we get a signal-- "Disperse!" </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we would run; and 'til it was all clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then we would resume again. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we sort of accepted that that's a way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We didn't question the parents who they were, why they're doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">That's the way it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  This was in 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And then what do you remember immediately after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Let's say in the...'40, early '40s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Well, then afterwards it started to...for...tightened, I guess use the word "tighten" the noose more. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They next step they did is, they took the licenses away of people--professional--of practicing their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Like I had a cousin who was a dentist, and he was not allowed to practice dentistry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We were supposed... We were forced to go secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So that if I went to a dentist and I had work some done and my teeth were bleeding...gums were bleeding, then I had to wait--make sure that the bleeding stopped--before I would leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Because if they would have caught me, seeing uh that I had dental care through a Jewish dentist, then they would have punished him and me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  How big a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> did you have there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  There were about 3,000 Jewish in that...and then about 7,000 Christians in that <span class="REGION">area</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My father was allowed to keep the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , because for some reason that I can't remember--I was about 10 or 11 at the time--is because we had Czech citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So they allowed those with Czech citizenship to keep the businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But those of Hungarian, they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I...L.... wasn't old enough there to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">In fact, we were really such...lived in such an isolated <span class="REGION">area</span> that the news would come from a drummer. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We have a drummer coming like old time and beating on the <span class="DLF">door</span> ; and we would all run out toward the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And then he would take out a piece of paper, and that's how we got our news. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So we never really realized that anything can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I heard things--events--happening, but I could not relate to what was going around the world at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So then what happen subsequently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Well, afterwards...then my father was drafted into the Hungarian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And this was a very, very dramatic experience for us, having him away, because we were so close knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then he was uh gone for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then they gave him a furlough. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And while he was gone, because I was the oldest in the family I was considered man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Uh, This was about 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I had to go on night guard with an older person. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And they gave us a stick in the hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I had no idea what this was all about, but we had to walk around the <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> to looking in case some saboteurs would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Uh, and uh I...I still wonder why should they take somebody my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">If somebody wanted to be a saboteur, do something, I'd run the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But you learned not to question. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It was a sense...you sense that they have the power, and you have to obey and you have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And then...uh later on, we continued...uh a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We missed our father very much, and continued going secretly to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then we saw deportations begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They...they uh ...took certain people--let's say the Hungarian nationality--first. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I had no idea what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My parents never really talked to me about what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And all I saw is people marching away towards the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And this was yet '42, in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And uh...some reason, I think people really didn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was like a fear, or they didn't want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I had no idea what was going on, and just accepted as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then, they announced that our turn was going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And my father, being in the military, was given the choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He could either stay in the army and save himself, or come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and be deported with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So he chose to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">How old were you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Twelve years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  So you were 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So your father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then, and uh he decided he was going to go with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I don't think he had any idea where we're being taken; because we were told that we are being taken to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , to...for him to work as a tailor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Well, the first inkling of what happened 1s, I recall it was in a Passover in '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And it was a Pesach night; and we ...all of a sudden, we heard the knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we were all frightened who it is, because we had the shutters down. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And here was somebody talking with a German accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And it was the German soldiers knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were not the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They were the German soldiers retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the strange thing was...about the whole thing is, that they come in... They were very polite in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They asked if they could stay, because our <span class="INT_SPACE">downstairs</span> was vacant since the Czech officer had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they even offered to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And they put on a picture that "Hey, we're not as bad." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And now I see why. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They wanted to have confidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They even put on some acrobatic things for the people, to show that they have come within...for good will. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But once they got the confidence of the people, then they showed their true color. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They came with guns afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">David, was this in '43 or '44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  This was in '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And then, we...we were notified that we were going to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And there was uh... Just been accepting for us; because we were very Orthodox, and this was the will of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And uh...(Excuse me) God will protect us and God will shield us from them, and just put our faith in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And uh...when it came to our turn, we were only allowed to carry in our possession with us what we could carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And we got a...like a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> that we put our belongings, only what we could carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I can still remember that sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">This is in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And after we loaded everything up and I looked at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ... And here, what the Hungarian Nazi's did, had the chutzpah to do on top of it--what they...what you call "insult to injury"--is that they gave my a father a signed document, right in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They even put a seal on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Stating that when we come back the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> will belong to us, that nobody else will take it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And yet, when I look back, within me I had the feeling that it's never going to be the same again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  So you loaded your...your...
ANSWER:  Personal belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  ... personal belongings on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Cart. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Yah, a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It had a couple of wheels.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And then what happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  After that, they uh marched us to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was like an assembly point, where what they would do is they would bring enough people until there was enough for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> load. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And, for us, this was like electric shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Whenever we heard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> before, in...in 1942 and 1943, when they began... Uh, because we knew that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> are coming to pick up more people, take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So we already knew that going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We didn't know what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But soon as we got into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we were there, it 1s like being thrown into a cage. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">All of a sudden, they show their viciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Saw a couple of people passed out, and they beat them up; and we tried to help, and they wouldn't let and wouldn't offer any help. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So we already sensed that something bad is going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So you were in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">What happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Well, after that we stayed there a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived; and then we were put onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It was still a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> , instead of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And uh...from there, I found they took us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matészalka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matészalka</span> was sort of a central point where they brought all the victims from all of the shtetlach around in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And tt's...just like they brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetlach</span> , that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> for all of the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So when they had enough people in there for a large...or whenever a transport was available, then that's where uh was the assembling point. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And that was...uh we lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And uh we...uh we didn't know what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Nobody said anything to anybody: where we're going, what's going to happen, where are we heading. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We knew we're waiting for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">For a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to take us someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It was not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we knew that we were going to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> finally arrived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Four, five weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I can't recall the exact. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And then, we still believed that we were being taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And this time, instead of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> , there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And they put us in, packed us very tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And there was hardly <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And the whole family there--my grandparents--they were still together. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And when they locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> , the click, and put the key on, I knew within me--I wouldn't share it--I knew we were in for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And when we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we could hear the Hungarian guards talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Even though it was totally locked, we could hear them talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So we knew we were guarded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> kept travelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was maybe a couple of days or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And then it came to a stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And we didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Then we heard talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">All of a sudden we heard Hungarian, we heard German talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then the Hungarian voices disappeared; and then German guards had taken over. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So that put fear in us, knowing that we're not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">That this was... And from there on in, it was the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I'd say the beginning of the end, for a lot of people. (</span><span class="sentence" id="208">Pause)
QUESTION:  Now once the Germans took over, what happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Then, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I think we traveled for another two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I'm not sure the exact amount of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I still remember, I could look through the cracks in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And I didn't know where was heading...we're heading, or where we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And I saw people working on damaged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And later on, I found out that that's...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was part of where they repaired--<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that were damaged during the war were stripped, used for spare parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And also I remember seeing these uh...they're sort of balloons, so that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> cannot fly too low. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I had no idea what purpose they were; but there're to prevent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> from flying very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And later... And I saw that sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And...and when we arrived, it was like in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was a nice day. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And we were all with anticipation. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Where...where are we heading? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> kind of kept slowing down; and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> whistle blowing, slowing down. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And then we see barbed wire compound there, and we see these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And within me, wondering what is this. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I never was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then, all of a sudden, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And that was... That's was when I saw <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="232">Pause)
QUESTION:  That was the first real <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  That was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  What happened there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Well, we were forced to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And all of a sudden, I...1 saw Nazis beating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I've never seen in my life like that, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Physically beating, dragging children away from their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Because in... Parents trying to go after children; and you hear shooting and yelling and crying and children... It is a sight that--I could not tell you what I ate yesterday, but I could tell you 45 years ago what...the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And all of a sudden, fear took over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">What is this all about? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">What's happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="243">What are we doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">This is not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">This is not what we had thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And all a sudden--we heard orders, barking: "That <span class="DLF">line</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That <span class="DLF">line</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That <span class="DLF">line</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And...nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was just panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Everybody ... And I found myself uh in a <span class="DLF">line</span> with other youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I had no idea which <span class="DLF">line</span> we were supposed to be, or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And uh...I was looking for my father, you see; because there were all men on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And I ran out from the group of youth that I was in, and I ran towards the adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that's what actually saved my life in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And then I saw, momentarily, my mother and my brother and sister going a different <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to them; this all happened so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And uh...I had no idea what...what is this all about? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">What is this standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">What is this here, and telling people to go one <span class="DLF">line</span> , another <span class="DLF">line</span> and this <span class="DLF">line</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And then my turn came, with my father standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It could have been Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It could have been somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I didn't even know who Mengele was, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But it was a Nazi officer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And uh...he uh...since I was with my father, he asked me how old I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And my voice just froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">For some reason, something within side me said, "Don't say anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And he kept saying, "How old are you?!"--"Wie alt bist du?!" </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And I just kept looking him, not saying anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And my father didn't know, either, what was...why he asked age. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And all of a sudden, he said I'm 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He sensed something, all of a sudden, then. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And he [NB: the Nazi officer] looked at me kind of suspiciously... "14?" </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And in a split second said, "Okay, you can go with the work group." </span><span class="sentence" id="277">If I... I kept wanting to say the voice, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">No, Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I'm only 12." </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And something held me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">If I would have said 12, that would have been it. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">What made me uh hold back my voice and not speaking, and what made him say... perhaps only God knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Or somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  So then you were put in with a work group, or separated from your...
ANSWER:  Family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You... Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">At this time, you had arrived... This was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Where did you go next, or what did you...? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ...uh they put us in a separate compounds, and gave us those cotton uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh, and we were just waiting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We had no idea uh what was. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then when [...during the day, when I walked around with my father, I would ask him, "What is that terrible smell? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What are all those <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> , that smoke and everything?" </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Either he wouldn't know...he didn't know, or wouldn't tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He just didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And that stench is just gruesome... awesome, from that smell constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And you see the smoke from the ovens day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And just to give you an example how we were duped into believing, to a point, that what they were doing was not happening, is a man came in all of a sudden in our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and he announced. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He says, "I've got good news. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I've just heard that in a couple of days we will be reunited with our families." </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And the families were dead already, and he still believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Now can you imagine that? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself already, and not being ab...not believing that this could be happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So how can you convince anybody else to try to tell a story, when in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself the people wouldn't believe that this could be happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So when... after about 5 or 6 days and they had arranged there, we told...we were told to march out and uh to get onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And we were in that group about um...13 people--13, 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Or in that range. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , uh my father said that today's my Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And he had secretly hidden, risking his life, a little bottle of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And he took it out; and he passed it around to everybody, and everyone had a little sip and had a toast. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And that's how I celebrated my Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But there was no time to think then on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">The time then was survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">That was... It keep...it kept us going, to believe that we're going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And, hopefully, that our families will survive, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We did not know what happened to them, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh...
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So you were now back on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And then we embarked in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I found later on was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="326"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> was a combination of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">A lot of the Gypsies were brought in for extermination in that camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And one of the things that I was told is survival means the ability to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">If you could work, there was hope for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">If you couldn't work, you were done. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So mentally I had to psyche myself out that I'm adult and I could do the work; and I wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And so when we got there, I was still with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And one of the first thing they did, is they asked...they wanted to have people who had trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">First thing they selected first in work groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And then they were...uh with all others, if they couldn't fit into work, then it was back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So then my father was fall...fell out of the group as a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And then they said, "Bricklayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Who's a bricklayer?" </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I raised my hand. "</span><span class="sentence" id="340">I'm a bricklayer." </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I never laid a brick or a stone in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I never even touched one. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But as I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I saw how people laid the bricks and the stones, how they mixed the cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And so I figured, "Well, I could do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Fall in <span class="DLF">line</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And they put me in the work group; and I...1n their eyes, I was a professional bricklayer. (</span><span class="sentence" id="348">Laughing) And I would mix cement and carrying the wheelbarrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And we had to go to a <span class="DLF">mine</span> where they mined stones, and then we had to carry each stone to a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> and build a little <span class="DLF">wall</span> underneath the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was useless work, for all practical purposes; but it kept us busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In their eyes, we were doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So, at least I was able to be with my father together. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And one of the things that stands out in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that I remember, that I was working with a Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He was Christian, and he was there... was incarcerated because he committed a crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So they also put him with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And he got a certain... And when we worked together, we talked about things: life, and uh he was telling me why he was...what crime he committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And next day, to flaunt [it] in my face, he waves goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Because he was released, free to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And here I thought, "I did not any crime or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And mine, there's no time limit for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Only death would be the limit." </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It was uh very, very sad to see that-- knowing that here he could go free, and here I didn't do anything that I was virtually sentenced for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Well, in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , I was there about 6 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">All of a sudden, without any warning, they yanked me out from the work group. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Nobody...there's no such thing as sitting down like you would say, "Well, tomorrow you're going to go someplace else, or do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Just, "Come!" </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And they yanked me and said, "Tonight, uh you're going to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And fortunately, I looked all around and I was able to find my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And we said goodbye * Also: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakau-P_aszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Located in the district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Closed January 15, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">through the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And it was a very, very sad moment, too; knowing that I would never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It...1t just you had that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I didn't give up hope, but it was very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Then they put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and uh was like an overnight travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And I found out after we arrived that it was a camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> was...I found out was a combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">An <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">processing camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So that when (excuse me) when the Russians were getting closer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , they didn't want us to be free...they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> , they uh...we were waiting there and in process of being sent to another work camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But before...uh we...they determined if we're going to be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or where, we were forced to strip naked in front of a...a doctor or somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And he looked us over like cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And he determined whether you were physically fit to do heavy physical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Or if not, then there was..they had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And [...they did not tell you where you're going to be sent or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And after about 6 weeks--it seems like an average cycle (laughing)--6 weeks, they put me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I'd become a professional (laughing) traveller at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And then I found out...at this time I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Actually, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , meaning that in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was primarily for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And when they wanted to exterminate somebody or end his life, they took him to <span class="NPIP">places</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gro Rosen</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They had their methods to their madness. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So again, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> ,’ the same thing. "</span><span class="sentence" id="396">We need bricklayers." </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Now, since I was a professional bricklayer (laughing), I right away raised my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I was put into a work group. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And it was very, very, very difficult work. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We had to march several miles to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I was already half dead when I already got to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And then to work yet, uh it took all the strength just to make it through the marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And then, when we marched back, if a person was not physically able to complete the march, they just shot him on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">There was no...there was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So uh... So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> , it was...uh this is where I spent the most time. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I was there about 6 months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  This is where you spent most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Can you tell us something about what... What was your daily life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  Well, we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">It was like this for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Ice cold; no heating at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">In the morning, we had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and take an ice cold shower in an ice cold <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">After we took the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , we had to go and stand <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the bitter cold for roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And finally, after that, they would give us some coffee and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">That was our ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And then...uh we would then be on standby for which work group we're going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Because every day they need work in different <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So then they would select us to go to a certain...oftentimes, work in the <span class="BUILDING">city building</span> <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And when there would be a raid, we had to stay in the <span class="DLF">open</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And they watched us from a distance.

Subcamp of GroB Rosen located in <span class="REGION">Lower Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">ran, we would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So we were not afraid; because when we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , we knew when we heard the bombing that they're coming to liberate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">A uh very unique incident happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> that kind of stands out a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Is when I was standing for roll call there; and as I'm standing, all of a sudden I hear a noise in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And during roll call, it was a rule you were not supposed to make any movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Not anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And I was very curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I looked up to see where that noise was coming from; and I saw it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bombers</span> flying over there on a mission to destroy <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And as I looked up with envy, wishing that I was one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , thinking [of] being free, all of a sudden I hear a shrill right in front of me that could be heard in front of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There was a Nazi Commandant saw me looking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And: "Du! </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Schweinhund!" </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Why did I disobey his order? </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And he had a big stick in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And his habit was, if somebody disobeyed one of his orders, he would ask him first, "Why did you do that," or "Why did you disobey?" </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And soon as the person answered, wham! </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He let him have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And oftentimes that person would be beaten so badly that he could not go back to work, or [it] put him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Now here was my turn. "</span><span class="sentence" id="441">Why did you disobey?" </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And the little voice inside that told me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> not to say anything, to keep quiet, was there the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Saying, "Don't answer! </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Don't say anything!" </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I was just looking straight in his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And he was waiting for me to reply, and he was getting very impatient. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">In front of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, here's a little Jew standing up there (laughing) that won't do what he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And that little voice <span class="NPIP">inside</span> saying, "Don't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Don't say anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He's getting...he says, "I know why you looked up." </span><span class="sentence" id="451">He says, "You wish you were on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , don't you? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">You wish you were free!," </span><span class="sentence" id="453">he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And I just keep looking straight in the eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He says, "Well, I got news for you!" </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He says, "You'll never be free again. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You'll never make it out alive from here!" </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And I just looked him straight in the eye; and I said, "Someday..."

QUESTION:  Let's come back to your typical day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Yes. (</span><span class="sentence" id="477">Drinking water) Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="479">You stood for roll call, and then you went to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Well, afterwards they uh...the Nazi Commandant sensed that there is still some youth left under 16 in the...in the work groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And he didn't know how to...I guess you use the words "flush them out." </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Because we all said we were older, and we were able to do the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So then they couldn't say that we couldn't do the work; because if we couldn't have done the work, they wouldn't have kept us there in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But he was very determined that he was not going to let any youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And then he decided he's going to play one of his games different; that he is going to offer extra rations to anybody that can turn in a youth under 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It's amazing what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">There's only a few that knew about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Adults there. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And before I knew it, all of a sudden I was yanked out from the work group and put with... We were about 13 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who were still...uh managed to hide until now. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And this time, they told us that we're being sent to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> because of...of our age. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I remember standing there with a group of others; and my thoughts were going through that this 1s the last day of life and that tomorrow will be end, and that I'll never return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And all of a sudden, I started concentrating mentally: that I want to return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I want to be with my family, I want to be free again. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I started--without me even being aware of this coming--it's like the mind almost like going out of control, the concentration. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">All of a sudden, as I'm doing that, here's the Nazi Commandant front of me, standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And I thought... "Raus!," </span><span class="sentence" id="496">he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I thought I'm the first one that going to be shot or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And all of a sudden, what happened that moment was that a group that was going out, a person had just passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And he [NB: the Commandant] went...passed through over a hundred people who were on standby--adults--and didn't ask them. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And came to my group, and ordered me to go back into the work group. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">All the others were taken to extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And for me, it was like a rekindling. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Here I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">As long as you were in a work group, there was still hope for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The interesting thing was...is that while I had hopes for survival being in the work group, I knew that now the Nazi Commandant knew about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He knew about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And every day, I wondered, "How long am I going to remain in the work group?" </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I knew that he was very obsessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Sure enough, after 6 weeks, I was yanked out of the work group and was taken into another compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">What they did is that they had a separate <span class="REGION">compound</span> for those who are no longer considered physically fit to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they would take them over to the compound, and then a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would take them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So this time, I pretty much resigned myself that no...no more concentration of being surviving, being able to make it; that this time I'm not going to make it, even though the will and desire was still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  So you...you sort of somewhat gave up on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But you...then what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Well, after about two weeks of uh...and being in that compound with the disabled and others... Uh, ironically, is during all this time--throughout the time there was now is about 9 months--throughout the ordeals, being exposed to all kinds of sicknesses and diseases-- typhus, cholera--I never even got sick once. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Didn't even catch a cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And because of my age...uh they found that I'm now...I was now with the disabled. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And after about two weeks, they said, "Okay! </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Everybody up!" </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They didn't tell us what. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And they took us into like half open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They gave us each a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And to march in; and they packed us in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I mean, like standing up, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It was like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So we knew that wherever we're heading, that this is going to be the final journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">This is not being taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And this was a journey that I will never forget for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">First, it...when we started that some people start getting weaker, and they could no longer stand anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Then they would fall down; and they'd be trampled on, because there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And soon as they were trampled on, they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They did not remove the dead after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And this...as...this was a 7 day journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And as the time went on, more people started passing out. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And one time, I still recall this, one uh Nazi came. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And then he...somebody spoke up or asked for some help, and he shot him right through the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And he just fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And it was an experience that I will never forget the rest of my life, 1s I fell down; and because there was now... About half of them were dead already; and you would sit and you talk to somebody just like a person like that like I'm talking to you, and all of a sudden he'd stop talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Just in the middle of the conversation, he died right there on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">This is the first time I was really confronted with death; because throughout when I lived in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , not...not one member of my family ever died or even went to a funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And this was a strange experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You just see him and all of a sudden stop talking, and he stays with the eyes open. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Then when I fell down, I uh...there was somebody fell on top of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I felt like...I actually felt like I'm dying already. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I could feel like...there was a feeling like I wanted to go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was not a painful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Just going to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And there was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ...this is... We have some...such awesome power within us. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">There was like...kept seeing, like an electric shock I kept getting. "</span><span class="sentence" id="552">Don't fall asleep! </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Don't fall asleep! </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Wake up! </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Wake up, because this is gonna be your last sleep!" </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And I didn't know how to get the body off me, because I was so weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And yet I knew that if I don't push him off that it'll be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So that little voice saying, "Come on! </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Muster all your strength, and you got to push him off." </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So all of a sudden then I just got on and the last strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And I pushed him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And then I fell on top of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And now he was trying to struggle to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And I just...I didn't even have the strength to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And he was trying to push me off, and he didn't have the strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I didn't have the strength to move, and we... Neither of us wanted to hurt each other or anything, but the bodies were all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There, nobody moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It was the most awesome, gruesome thing that ever human beings can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And we would travel by...1 remember we would be...would be like a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> overhead, where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> go by, and it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And people would look down, and look at us like, "What's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It's kinda strange." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And they had no idea what it was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And then all of a sudden, when I finally did push him up out of the way and I...he fell down and I...I fell on top of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Now he was struggling to push me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And I was holding there; and all of a sudden, he got up and his final moment of breath and he bit my leg, right in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And then he fell back and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I had the most gruesome, gruesome nightmares for many years from this experience. (</span><span class="sentence" id="578">Pause)
QUESTION:  How many days...which day was this here? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">You said the journey was 7 days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  About seven days, I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Yah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">What happened...what happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">ANSWER:  Well, the journey...my thirst. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They didn't...they just gave us a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We couldn't even eat, because we were very thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And the thirst pains were so bad that I even tried to use the urine from my body, just to wet my lips. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I pretty much, as it went down uh... When we arrive, this was, I found out later, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And when we arrived, I had already passed out, virtually. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Three out of 150 there survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They all...the rest of them just lay dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And what they did 1s, they pick me up from the...with the hands and somebody else with the legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And then they threw me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> ...and they're getting ready to take me to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">That's where they took...that's where their objective was. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And somehow, they...somebody who was carrying me noticed a hand moving, that I was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So at a risk to his life, he took me into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It was actually like a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And I was dazed at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Virtually, I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I thought... And when I came to [in] the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> there, 1t was... I woke up, and I...I thought I was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I felt like I was in another world. "</span><span class="sentence" id="602">What are these people doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Where am I?" </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And I thought, I...I...1 was totally dazed. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I couldn't figure out even where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And then somebody came over and told me what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Explained to me that "You were just a few seconds away from being thrust into the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , and they saw that you were still alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And they said, "You're the first youth that age who actually made it alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And then they took me and they hid me, you know, secretly in their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So I was not even supposed to have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And I became like, to them, like a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">That here are these fathers who said, well, if I made it then maybe their children would have made it through. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And they...since I didn't get any rations, because I was... The ration was there like a piece of bread--enough to keep them alive until they were actually being...were going to be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And each one would take a piece of bread; and they would break off a piece and make up a slice for me, so that I could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And they said, "David, you must survive and let the world know what happened." </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I had no idea what they meant, or what they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">That basically was what had driven me to tell this story--not to make sure that it is not...make sure that it is not forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And so over there, after... In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , I...uh started getting on my feet again; and found out I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And uh... Every night I heard the earth shaking from the bombardments. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And here, in my mind I was thinking, "It is now really a race against time." </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We knew any day that this 1s going to end. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The question was if we're going to make it out alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  So this gave you some more courage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  Hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">To be able to go on, to...to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">What kept me is the belief that maybe my family is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And it was... in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , it was uh really uh very traumatic experiences that you would talk to one person one night, and the next morning he's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And then he would be taken like a piece of garbage and thrown on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">You don't think...you're not a human being anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">You don't even know what you're thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">You're just a person dazed, traumatized. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And don't even know by what I'm hanging tn. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But the will to live there was still strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  What happened next after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Well, I was there about 6 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And all of a sudden, again, I was yanked out (laughing) without any warning and put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Now this time I could consider myself really a professional! </span><span class="sentence" id="638">It was a really a strange experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I actually walked out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> on my own two feet--which a Nazi said...Commandant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> said I would never do. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They took the few of us that could still walk, and they marched us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And we had no idea why they were marching us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">This was about three days before the Americans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And I learned, years later, what actually their main purpose was. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But at that time, I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And we travelled for about a couple of hours or so; and then they told us to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And I found out that I was...it was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And as we were walk...marching off from...getting off from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , I remember that I saw...I looked...a couple of women in a group there, looking...were staring at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">That they were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And within me, I sensed that something is going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And after we marched out of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , they started shooting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They massacred many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And we got to a <span class="DLF">street</span> , uh...and 1t was, this was...this was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ...1in the Tyrolian Mountains of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And all of a sudden, they started...the machine guns started firing at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And many just panicked, run in every direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Something...I had something <span class="NPIP">inside</span> told me, "Look where that fire is coming from." </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And as I saw it, and I dived into a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and it just missed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And uh this was still in April of '45, now. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I slept all night in that <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">When I woke up in the morning, snow was all over me and I was virtually frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I couldn't get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I had to walk bent over. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I had no idea where I was, what in the Hell I'm doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I started... just started trying to straighten out a little bit; and then I started marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And all of a sudden, the Germans came and rounded us up again--those who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And then...
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Can you hold for a little while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  Yah, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  Because they're going to have to change and put in a new tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">TAPE #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
ANSWER:  Well, after they rounded us up again...uh it was a strange phenomena that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">AIl of a sudden, there were soldiers, civilians, hunters with their rifles got together with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And no one talked to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">No one said a word to us, or what's going, or where we're heading. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And just told [us] to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And...(excuse me)...and we had no idea where we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">All I knew is that I was marching towards the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I saw the German soldiers retreating, going the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And we kept going 'til nightfall. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And all of a sudden, when we got through...nightfall came, they told us to march forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And then they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Everyone! </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The hunters, the civilians, the soldiers... No one tells you, and you don't question. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And then, as a protection, a few of us, we went and started climbing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We figured we would be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">We didn't...the guards disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We were left on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So then I marched to the highest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , with the strength that I had left; and I slept in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> there overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We found a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And when morning came, there were about 10 of us assembled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We could look from the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But we couldn't tell whether they were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German vehicles</span> or whether they were American. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And so somebody said... You know, I didn't have any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I was very starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And somebody had [food] there. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They said, "We'll give you some food if you'll go down and take a look." (</span><span class="sentence" id="699">Laughing) Well, I figured like this: "If they're Americans, I would be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And if...if not, either way, I'd end up being starved to death or be back in <span class="INT_SPACE">captivity</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So I said, "I'll go." </span><span class="sentence" id="702">That was the most suspenseful walk down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I am walking slowly, slowly, slowly, to go down and see who are they. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Well, I could not tell what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American vehicles</span> look like; but I knew they were not German. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So I assumed it must be (laughing) the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And as I walked down and I saw that they were not German, I motioned for the others also to come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I never did get the food, (laughing) because I never went back up again for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicles</span> going by. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And for me, that was one of the most moving experiences in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Because I actually saw the mighty German Army surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">American soldiers holding guns behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And here are these same soldiers [who] were holding guns on my back, and now somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">This is...it's so difficult to explain...to...how life can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Here, one day here's a group of people that wanted to destroy you; and here's another group of people that want to save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And as I got down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , I waved a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> to flag him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So [he] pulled over. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And it was one of those small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> where soldiers were sitting in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And I waved at him; and I couldn't speak a word of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So, the only thing [NB: way] I would tell him that I'm hungry, I just pointed my finger (laughing) at my mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So they gave me some crackers, and they just went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I just started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I don't know where I was walking. (</span><span class="sentence" id="723">Laughing) There wasn't anybody there uh picking me up, or asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">They were just busy, the soldiers, going up to finishing up the final remnants of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Um, I wanted to share something, to back track a little bit, on... When the Germans had retreated and the...we were walking towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , we were actually walking into a <span class="DLF">line</span> of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Because the American soldiers... That's what actually the Germans wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They wanted us...hoping we would get killed by American firepower. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And we received a terrific pounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">The earth was shaking and trembling from American guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Because they...we were right in no man's land, there in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So after having gone through that <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> --and I remember that night, saying, "If I'd only make it through that night," I said, "I would be free." </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And I wrote... Later on, I wrote a poem about that...I'm not afraid... Entitled, "I'm not Afraid to March Forward, Because that's the Road to Freedom." </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And that poem won a golden award for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So it made me feel pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It describes my feelings as I am marching toward the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> --the thoughts, and the feeling that tomorrow I'll be free again. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And then I...I have some music with it; and I used it as a teaching [tool]. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And when I speak to students, we sing it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And...and it's very inspirational for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And as I started going back, I started walking, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicle</span> stopped and picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And what they were doing, they were picking up survivors like me, stragglers who were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And they carried me through...first to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> , and uh...Gar...Garmisch. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Yah, Garmisch is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And we...1t was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I saw most of the women were wearing white nurses' cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So I asked, "What is a white nursing... Why is everybody all of sudden a nurse?" </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Well, what I was explained is that the Russians, when they invaded, they used to rape women. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And this way, they thought the Americans would do the same things. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So by being a nurse, they were hoping they wouldn't be. (</span><span class="sentence" id="749">Laughing) So they then took me to a <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Not at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">First they took me into a <span class="BUILDING">German home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And they were giving everybody the C-ration food now. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And everybody was grabbing it, and taking... We were in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...I think we were about 10 or 15 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I was the only one that turned them down, American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And they said, "Look here, everybody's eating the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">How come you're not eating it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I said, "That food is going to make me sick." </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I said, "I am not used to eating that good kind of food." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They said, "Well, what do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I said, "I'd like to have some fresh vegetables." "</span><span class="sentence" id="762">Where are we going to get fresh vegetables? </span><span class="sentence" id="763">There's a war going on! (</span><span class="sentence" id="764">Laughing) And you want fresh vegetables!" </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Well, they saw the seriousness of me, that I really wasn't going to eat that food--even though I was nothing but skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They went to German farmers and collected potatoes and carrots. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And they brought it to me; and I had a little pot, and I boiled it. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And that's the only food I ate for about 3 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I didn't need any medication or anything to recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Many of those who ate that food became sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Some even died. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Mainly because their system just wasn't used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">That little voice, again, was there: "Don't eat that food." </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Now after about 3 weeks, I was able to start eating regular food. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But until the body became acclimated, then I was just eating that. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And they were just [so] amazed, that I was like this American soldiers' center of attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">They look at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">How can somebody who is skin and bones still be alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  And then you went from there... Let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">You were in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Then where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  Then they took me to...they called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garmisch-Partenkirchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">This was a sanitartum used by the Austrians for rehabilitating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And they used that as a shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So they took us to a central point there; then awaiting transportation to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So again, when I was over there, the American doctors wanted to give me medication and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And I said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I just want to have the natural foods, and then I'll be all right." </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I didn't have to take any medication or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And within three weeks, I was ready to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Again! (</span><span class="sentence" id="792">Laughing)
QUESTION:  So where did you travel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  Then from there, the American army took me uh to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">It's called Plze_. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plze_</span> , they...1t was then that portion became...it was...1t was divided in American and <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So I remember an American officer was saying, "Are you sure you want to go back into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Sure you don't want to stay in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Come..." I wouldn't even think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">In fact, I remember when I was in uh...recuperating in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garmisch</span> , there was somebody there from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And he had a son my age; and he wanted me to come to stay with him, to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And there's no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Uh, so once we got into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , then it was entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">We didn't get treat...any special treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And as I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to take another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , all of a sudden I saw people...people uh there. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Yelling, shouting, throwing stones; and here they caught a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And they're... Somebody said, "Well, why don't you stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And you can have revenge on them." "</span><span class="sentence" id="808">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And that was the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I had run toward the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> ; and I ran and ran, and I just missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">It felt...1t was very depressing, because I was so anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Then finally another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came and took me to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , when I walked in there...in that square, it was like a million people all had converged--they're coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And it was ironic that after I arrived, they start asking question about your age. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And was the first time I could tell what my real age (laughing) was, without having to have fear that uh something would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And then, they said that it would... they didn't know how long they could...I would have to wait, because there were so many people who wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Those who had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And that the only way to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was to travel on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , one of those cattle type <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Can you imagine the experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Travelling overnight when I had nothing to hold on to. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And just swinging there, going through <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I was so anxious to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And finally when I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sighet</span> "... This was in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">It was about 15 miles from where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And this was my next point before getting <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  So then you... Eventually, you did get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sziget</span> , the only way from there to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And this was at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I finally got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">It was about 2:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">There was the Russian soldiers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And I didn't know what they'd do; I thought they'd shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">So I just stood still in those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And I was so elated I was finally <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And then the next morning, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I found that there was a Russian family living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">They wouldn't even let me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">They said this is their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">It belongs to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And I said, "Can I just go in and just open the <span class="DLF">door</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Because my survival was the ability that I saw myself opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I just wanted to have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> ; and this was the most touching moment for me, that here is a vision that I carried with me and finally came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Then it entailed a scene what it's like living under the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I would lose my freedom again. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I found a cousin that survived; and uh we both decided that we are going to leave from there forever, and not...not make it our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So then where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">ANSWER:  From there, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sziget</span> again, where I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And I didn't know where I was going to head. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I just knew that I wanted to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I heard...word was passed on that there is a uh organization to help people to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And here I was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Nobody cared for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And the only way to get--we had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> --was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And this time, we had to have tickets for travelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I didn't have any tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I didn't have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And I went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; they didn't notice me. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And when I got to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> --it was probably Debrecen, or something--they started checking for tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It was at night, and I didn't have one. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And I ran out of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ; and the ticket master yelled to the police, "After him! </span><span class="sentence" id="864">After him!" </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And I ran, and ran in a bombed out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I was there by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And I said, "My God, what in the heck am I doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Here I was supposed to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> free, reunited with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Here I'm a fugitive, the police are after me!" </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And I heard them talking: "Did you see anybody run in here? </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Did you see anybody running there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="872">They couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And then they finally left. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The next day, I didn't give up.

QUESTION:  So that took you to where? * </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Rom: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sighetul-Marma_iei</span> , or Hung: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mamarossziget</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Located in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> near the <span class="DLF">northern border</span> with <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and the Ukrainian SSR. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Under Hungarian control during 1940-1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER:  It took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , I found out that there was a youth group. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Those that were...few that survived, and others that were hidden during the war, were now decided also to leave Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And we formed what we called a "kibbutz" to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , 1t was called at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And after waiting for about six months over there, (excuse me) they told us that the only way we'd be able to get out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is to go on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , like we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; because the Russians were not allowing legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So they had to...whatever arrangements, whoever made it didn't explain anything to me other than get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And...and I remember we were travelling at night, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going through just like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> --cling, cling, going; cling, cling, stopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And just wondering if we'll ever be discovered, because we went illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Finally, morning came; and they told us that we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , in <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So we knew we were finally free. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">So when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we stayed there about two or three days... Uh, I'm trying to think in which...there's a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that uh...very famous <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I can't think of it right now; but we stayed there about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And they said we will not be able to go directly to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , because the British were blockading it. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Uh, that we'll have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Talk about depression (laughing) setting in!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">QUESTION:  So then you are now on the move again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">ANSWER:  Back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again! (</span><span class="sentence" id="897">Laughing) This is why I had done this story before. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I called To <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> and Freedom; and this is a continuous story where I superimpose the sounds of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Because that's what this is all--the whole story of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , travelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Then, when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they put us into a former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And uh it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And we were then there processed, preparing ourselves to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">One, we learned military drill; because they told us that as soon as we're going to get in there, we're going to be in the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">From one <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> to another <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">But we were not afraid, because we knew this time that we'll have to fight for our freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">It's not going to come easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And in between times--this is really ironic-- they arranged, whoever was in charge of the whole thing, for us to learn farming; trained by German farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So we learned farming, learned how to plant seeds for <span class="DLF">farms</span> ; and learning how to prepare for war again. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And we found out that after...1t's almost a year waiting, tha...uh the...they would not allow legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">They would only allow one [person] a month from our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">From the various groups, the British would only allow so many per month. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So what we would do in the kibbutz 1s we would put our name in our hat...in a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And then the one that got pulled out, that [one] got [to go]. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I remember one, the first one that got [to go], when he arrived--he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and told us how wonderful it is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And uh we were really eagerly looking forward to the day we would join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And then after about a year waiting-- frustrating, depressing, waiting--all of a sudden somebody from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> calls me in and that somebody wants to talk to me. "</span><span class="sentence" id="917">What is it about?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="918">Well, do you have any relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="919">First thing, I said, "Well, I think I have an aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">But I don't know any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Why?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="922">Well, your relatives just found out about you." </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I had about four aunts that I didn't know, my father's sisters. "</span><span class="sentence" id="924">And they want you to go come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I said, "Oh, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I'm... And <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 's not for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Okay, then they sent telegram back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , saying, "He doesn't want to come." </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Then they sent another telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">They said, "Well, if you really want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , then it will be easier to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> than from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I just wanted to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I will accept their kind offer, and I'll come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="934">That's how I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  And where did you come to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and I stayed there for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And I lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> ; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was just overwhelming for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">So then they...I...they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> when I arrived from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I stayed there with the family, for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Then I started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And that's when... I was one of the few, very few, of my age who made it; and when I started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I... was looked at like [I] came from another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Because uh I was their age, and uh they were all very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">But they didn't even know how to approach me or ask me any questions, because everything was so fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">In their minds, they had just seen in the movies the horrors and these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So I was looked at as uh somebody who had come from another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">You know, it was a strange experience to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And yet, it was a struggle; because the teachers had a struggle with what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I was at an age, I was too old for <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> and I missed all that background in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> to be in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So what do they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">They send me [to] both! (</span><span class="sentence" id="951">Laughing) To <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> private tutoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">From that, and... Talk about having a rough <span class="DLF">road</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="953">But I managed to keep up with them; and...and I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And I was just getting on my feet, starting... starting to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , when I get a "Dear John" letter from Uncle Sam. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">That was when the Korean War was on. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">That was just a joke. (</span><span class="sentence" id="957">Laughing)
QUESTION:  How old were you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  I was about 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">So what happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Well, they said, "There's a war on, and you're of military age. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And you're going to be drafted." </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And then I tried to explain to him what I just went through, that <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I told him that uh being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> would be very detrimental for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Well, they were...listened and said, "Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">We'll give you two choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Either go to the draft, or go to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Which one do you want?" (</span><span class="sentence" id="969">Laughing) Very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Naturally, uh... didn't want to go to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I took--I may not say the better of the two, but I took one of the two. (</span><span class="sentence" id="972">Laughing) And when I arrived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military training camp</span> ... That night, it was the most gruesome, the most horrible experience of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Because it brought back all of the traumatic experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">It was at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Flashlig...the lights were on the perimeter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the barbed wire of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And the shouting: "Get off! </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Get off! </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Get in there!" </span><span class="sentence" id="979">You know, it was just like a repeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And get in there; and the first thing, that "You guys are the lowest scum on earth!" </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And telling you, "We're going to make men out of you!" </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I thought, "Here we go again." </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And the next thing they do is that we're going to shave. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And I said, "Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">They're not going to do that!" </span><span class="sentence" id="987">But they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And to do it, I had to numb myself like I did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">All that healing that I was just going through, that they were just coming; with everything there, [1t] was destroyed in that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">QUESTION:  You're talking about shaving your head?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">ANSWER:  Shaving my head, and cutting the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And just being back in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">So I lived with the same survival instinct that I had to do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And it was very depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">It was very traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">But there's no one to turn to that you can say how you really feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">No one can really understand or relate. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">They had no feeling to even think how I would feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And so I'm just like a machine, numb machine, going through the mechanical motions of something that I was forced into doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And I managed to keep up with the training, until one day they announced that part of the training exercise will be...is to go through a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> of tear gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And that was like a bolt of lighting would have struck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Suddenly, the next day I...I started limping a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I just couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And the limp got worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And it got so bad that I just could not walk anymore, and my whole body became totally paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I...I was just like a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I'd pick up my hand and it'd fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Well, they carried me in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> , just like the kind they carried me in--a little bit fancier, but 1t was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , 1t reminded me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And the doctors started asking questions, "What happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Well, after they learned of what happened, they were so upset that how could they--the military authorities--not recognize some compassion of uh helping me stay out, or do something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">So they said they are...that I have suffered enough in my life already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">That they are now willing to give me a medical discharge, and I can go back into civilian life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Well, there was that little voice again. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Laughing) For better or worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And uh...I told the doctor, I said, "One." </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I said, "I want to stay in, because I want to complete my military obligation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Because I want to pay...repay my debt to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for liberating me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And the other thing is," I told him, "the Nazis could not keep me down on my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I walked out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And I want to walk out with an honorable discharge, and not a medical discharge." </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">They were very surprised; because they said, "My God," they said, "they...there are some guys here, they'd give their right hand if they could get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Because you're going to be in the fighting right after you get through." </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But I was just numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I...1 was just... I don't know what I was...whether it was really me saying; but I just said, "I'll make it.". </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And I went back in training again; and I asked them only one thing, before I went back, is to waive the requirement of having to go through that <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And they said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And I went back training again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And it was just like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Up in the 4:00 morning, standing roll call again. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Laughing) "You're the lowest scum on earth!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Again, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Here we go again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">How much more can a person take something like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">But you become numb, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">You...you're not really sensitive to feelings any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">You just...you know that you have to do that to get over to get to the next step. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And I knew, just like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , that they are rewards for hard work in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And I went and I really worked hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Not only in physical training in the military, but we had to do a lot of training we had to learn from books--tactics, manuevers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And I made up my mind that I wanted to be on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And we finished...we were like a hundred and fifty of us; and I finished in the top three on the 150. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And then, because of that, they sent me for special military intelligence training school.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  What happened with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">ANSWER:  Well, uh...when--ironic--when I finished and they sent me out to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they...uh they made me in charge of the group of the... They gave me 1n charge of the record. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And I had no idea why, really, I had all those problems from the...from what caused the paralysis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And since I was in charge of the records, I looked up...I was able to look and see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">They wouldn't tell me why it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">They just said... And then I learned that it was because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Because I didn't understand yet all this what's going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I knew it was from that, but I really did not know the details of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So this kind of helped me uh understand myself a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So then, when we got into training and I finished, I was almost a year in communications intelligence; because what they trained us for is to be front line person for the war, to report what's going on for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">It was in the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And then after I finished training and they sent me to the South for more advanced training; and then they sort of divided up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Half of us went to Europe, and the other half went to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Fortunately, my name--because it was alphabetical--they took the first half of the alphabet list, they sent to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">So it was a little bit of luck there, because if I had gotten into <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> I would have been sent... My function was the training to be a front line observer like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">So when they sent me to Europe--they didn't say where--when I got to Europe, they said I'm going to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Laughing) And ironically, when there I was...I was numbed again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I said, "There is one thing that I'm gonna do...want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Is I want to finish my military obligation, and I want to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Because when I left that group in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1946, I made a commitment that someday I'll look them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And so I saved up all my military leave time, and uh used it up to go to Europe [NB: <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">It was a...as I'm talking, there was a little incident that is ...happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that I thought it would be worthwhile sharing with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Is...uh part of my job was also delivering supplies to the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were stand...where we stayed, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And once when I was driving--this was a real big-semi <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that I was driving--and it was really rainy, very slippery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">As I was going up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , I was going...and all of a sudden, as I was going downwards, I see a group of civilians right in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I slam on the brakes and my whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went out of control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And the civilians scattering all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And here I am fighting to bring the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> under control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And all of a sudden, finally, I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went a little uphill climb, and it came to a stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And all of a sudden, the German civilians were came and all around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So since I could speak German, I asked if I did any harm or any damage when this... Because I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">They said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Uh, then I said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Why don't you just move out, and I want to keep going." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1080">No." </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">They took ... And they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ; and they parked it right in front of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">They weren't going to let me go, and they wouldn't tell me what uh it's all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And I figured ... Well, I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in gear and started pushing that other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> off the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And they were trying to prevent me from doing... And all of a sudden, I see a German comes up and with a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Yells, "Halt!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And that was... I had a gun, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">We were given it to protect ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">All the fury that ever came out... Because I didn't want to, before, intermingle with anything; because I knew I'm there to do my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I yelled out...back at him, that he was so shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Here a American soldier is yelling at him in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">He didn't know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">He said, "Raus!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And I said, "I didn't do any harm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I didn't do any damage to anything, and I'm not going to get out." </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And he saw the seriousness on my face, and he saw... And he reminded me of that Nazi Commandant, and...that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I mean, here...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> , being if it was like that, I wouldn't have said one word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And here, there were all kinds of witnesses around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">There were two in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And he saw that it was a good chance that he could have died, too, if he did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And I that felt...I said, "I'm not going to let go." </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I felt, and a thought came to me, "Here I came as a...to keep the peace, and I could end up dying." </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And he saw the seriousness there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And he was looking around and he was thinking (laughing) that maybe (laughing) it could happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And he put the gun back in his holster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And I asked him, "What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Why...why all this happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">What's going on." </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">He said [that] ahead of me, there happened to be an American soldier was driving [who] inadvertently killed a German civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">So the civilians were harassing the American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Or anybody that come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And be like in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and the person go out of control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And then they'd run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And I just happen to be in the <span class="DLF">road</span> again. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Laughing) And what did he do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Three weeks later, I get called in by the commander from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">He says, "Dave, I just got a report that you killed a German civilian." </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Of course, I had the witness and told the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">He was so angry of what that German policeman did, trying... because of what I did [that] he wrote to the mayor of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , telling that this is not Nazi Germany anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And so that's when that ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">QUESTION:  Okay, then, right after... Then, after you completed your service in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">ANSWER:  I went for that... I told you about that visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> --it was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in 1956. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And after I got back, I went back to civilian life, and tried one more time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Laughing) So then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school of engineering</span> , since I was in communications engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And I went and also got a job, working in the day and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">How did you end up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">ANSWER:  Well, this company I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> that I worked for, uh transferred me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And that's...
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Thanks very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I think we went through the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">ANSWER:  Yah, it's... I think that uh we can all learn from what has happened, that... The things that I try to emphasize, as I teach it in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , is to...for the...those who are involved in teaching education to teach the youth that this is not a one-time happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">That we must understand ourselves first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">That we have to understand that--and this is difficult to communicate--that every human being is capable of carrying out horrors and atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Because there were some uh victims in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> who became Kapos, that were more brutal than the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Because they wanted to have favors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And then there were some guards, who did...all they did 1s guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">They did not uh actually uh abuse people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">In fact, as I look back, there was one incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> that happened that I was working in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woman's compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And there were uh newly arrived women in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> who saw me uh working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And was...must have been a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And she says, "Kinderle." (</span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Beckoning with his arm) I turn around. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1143">You! </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I got some food for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I said... She says, "Come on! </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Come on! </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The guard is not looking now." </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So I ran to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> quickly, and she gave me some bread, and I ran back to the detail...work detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And there was a guard coming [who] saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Once you did that, that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And he said...it was uh one thing...once you were caught, it was off to a <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">It was traditional they take you to a <span class="DLF">wall</span> with a stick; and you got the stick and picked it up and walking to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And I prepared myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And all of a sudden, just before we got there, he stopped and he asked me how old I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And here was a little voice that said... For the first time, I had to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">If I told him my real age, I knew I was gonna... If I told him the truth that was my age, then I knew that that was the end; because he would turn me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">There was a voice saying, "This time, tell what your age is." </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I told him that I am 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">He looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">He says, "Get back to work!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And I was expecting, after that incident happened, that he would turn me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And he never turned me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Strange things happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  So you gave the right answer that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER:  Why I did, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It...1t just... You...you're faced with a split decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">You don't know who's telling you to do what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">You just...and then you... I know if I had have said 16, that would be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And I took a chance, [a] risk, saying that I was 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And...
QUESTION:  Dave, I want to thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">It was a terrific interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">You really expressed yourself well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And thank you for inviting me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">QUESTION:  I think that there were some wonderful things that you brought up, and you brought out some new facts and things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">ANSWER:  I hope that what I shared will be of benefit to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Thanks a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION PHOTOGRAPHS & OBJECTS (1) David's grandparents and aunt in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bochov</span> in 1937, when his aunt returned from the <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to get married.
