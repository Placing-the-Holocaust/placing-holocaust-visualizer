<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tom, could you give us just a sense of your family background, a little bit of where you came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; my father had eight — seven brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">There were eight brothers altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And my mother had 12 sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But I didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I knew only one of them because by the time I was born after World War II — World War I, I'm sorry, there were only one of my mother's sister alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And my father, he had brothers, and some of them died in World War I. And as I mentioned to you, big family, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Now, what else would you like to know? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">What my father did? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father was photographer, and he was the official photographer for the Hapsburg family, was the king that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And after that he was the official photographer of Admiral Horthy! </span><span class="sentence" id="11">whom he knew from World War I, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They were together in the so-called “war minisztérium.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And he had a very well known <span class="BUILDING">photography studio</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , at that time, for the upper class, princes and barons and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And besides it also, he was a high society photographer, let's put it, in short.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Did you learn photography with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I grew up in photography, and I had a brother of mine who was also a photographer, and — but he was 11 years older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I learned photography from my father, which his famous saying was, "I'm not teaching you. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">You just watch me." </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was just watching him. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And when he died, he was right, because I knew most of it from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Naturally, I had studying, but the actual photography I learned from him; just watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Besides, speaking about photography, he was mostly doing portraits, studio portraits, and he wanted to — me to go out and do outside work, which I loved to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">As a matter of fact, I didn't want to be a photographer until I was 15, and that's when I — excuse me — that's when I had the feeling that I want to be a photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And he also had a <span class="BUILDING">photography shop</span> ; small, elegant <span class="BUILDING">photography shop</span> with cameras. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I decided I want to be a photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I took the first camera, which was a Leica from the shelf. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And he wasn't there, but he just came in and he said that, "What are you doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I said, "I want to be a photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I took this camera I'm starting with." </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He took the camera out of my ' Miklés Horthy * Ministry (Hungarian) hand; he put it back on the shelf. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He took the oldest camera that exists which — not with films, with plates — and he said, "That's where you start, with the oldest camera." </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He said, "If you want to know photography, you have to start from scratch."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  What kind of photography did he do for Admiral Horthy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  He sent to do Admiral Horthy — I don't know if you've ever seen his pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They were done by him and he did his portraits. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Also, he did all the new — well, that wasn't personal for Admiral, or the new Secretary of State or Secretary of War or this or that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The official photography for the cabinet. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Later on, I was quite young, he sent me up to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  What was the impact, then, given the Horthy's position obviously changed with the Nazi movement into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">What happened in terms of his work and the relationship to Horthy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was going on until quite — the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I mean, end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horthy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I have a funny story to tell you if — I don't know if it belongs here or not, but as I said, every time there was a new cabinet member, he was called up until maybe I was 16 or 17, he started to send me up to the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> to do the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So one morning, he got the call, and that was during the war already, maybe in the mid— around 1943, I would say, which was close to the end of the war — but we didn't know that then — that the new Secretary of War will be coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They changed, because <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was starting to get slowly out of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So anyway, he got the phone call to send — to go up. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So he said, "In the afternoon you have to go up to the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> to do the new Secretary of War." </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I said, "I cannot do it." "</span><span class="sentence" id="53">Why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I said, "Because" — it's hard to explain it, at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> from the early '20s, there was a so-called paramilitary. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was a paramilitary organization which you had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was a must. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And they were practicing every week outside the outskirts of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So I said to him, "Because I have this obligation." </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He said, "The <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You don't go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I said, "I have to, because — Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Then ask the head of there what you have to do and he will release you." </span><span class="sentence" id="63">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So I went out there, and there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , and at the beginning you had to — is it interesting at all, what I'm saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">At the beginning you had to go to him and ask for permission to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He said, "What is the reason?" </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I said, "Because I have to take the picture of the new Secretary of War." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He looked at me and said, "You." </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I said, "Me." </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He said, "Well, I let you do it, because that's the biggest lie I have ever heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I'll let you do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But you bring me a paper where you have been Tuesday afternoon between 3:00 and 5:00," because that's — So I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I did the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And after the picture taking, I knew he was the head of the cabinet, minisztérium for PR and so forth, and I went to him in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and I said, "I need the paper that I — he was laughing, and he gave me the official paper of the Hungarian cabinet stating that Thomas Veres was, between 3:00 and 5:00, taking picture of the new Secretary of War. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Next time I showed it to him, and he flipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That's the end of that story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Tom, could you give me some sense, then, of the first impact of the Nazis when things began to change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Well, certain things did begin to change, and don't call it "the Nazis," because actually — wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You call Nazis the German Nazis or the Hungarian Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  That's a good question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That's why I'm asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Which one do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Because that was two different period. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> not necessarily was on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> , and the historical background comes out now in today's days because of World War I mistake when the biggest part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And Hitler was the only one who was supporting, because he himself was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's leader, to get back what was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now, I don't in history — I have to give you the historical background, which I think it's important because that made <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> on the side of the Axis. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And that made Horthy on the side of the Axis, because <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> 's part was taken most. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Now, today, and in recent history, when <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> 's breaking apart, one and a half million Hungarians were living there, then the <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Transylvania</span> was taken away when two million Hungarians lived there, and just two days ago when <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , the upper part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was — the lower part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was mostly Hungarian, a million and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And that was the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And they were not Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It was a first only rightist government, and then it became more sliding to the right, more to the right, and at the end it became a Nazi government. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But it was not a Nazi government until October — even then it wasn't called, because the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in March 19th, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And from March 19, '44, Horthy lost his power. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He was just a figurehead. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And in October 15th, when the government was taken over, those are the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Then it became actual Nazi government. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Does it answer your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  It's a good background to it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So you came from a Jewish family; correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  So there must have been some danger at some point that had an impact on you or your photographic activities were not exactly normal, I presume.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">In all honesty, you know, there were Jewish laws which started in 1939, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But there were one, two, three different kind of Jewish laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But, personally, I was not affected by it direct. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Not the photography, and not in personal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But you knew what was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">At least you thought you knew what was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And, let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My brother, who was 11 years old — 11 years older than I am, he married an American which was accidental. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It had nothing to do with Jewish or not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And two days later or three days later, actually, he was called up for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , to serve in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But he wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Except the bad rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There were people who were affected; but, personally, I wasn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Were you ever called in to labor service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Yes, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was after the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">1944, they came, 19 — March 19, and I was called up April 7th, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">What happens is a long story, but I went to the upper part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and I — I was sent to the huge camp for — which was for only putting together the different outfits and sending either to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> or — I had the luck of the fate that I was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which was — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miskolc</span> is the name, and I was there from March — no, from April to August. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And in August, another luck of fate was that I was sent — the whole outfit was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I worked in a — it's a <span class="BUILDING">wood factory</span> making ammunition boxes until — and that was from August till October when the Hungarian Nazis took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And that's when this outfit was — the word came that the outfit 1s sending — was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I said goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  How’
ANSWER:  How? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I knew the captain, and by then we had — I don't know if you read it or — we had exemption for my father and his whole family for the Jewish laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> but not as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Exempt and with different armband, and I was in very good friendship with the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I said to the captain, "Goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I'm not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I was stepping down to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And that's when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> ,’ who I didn't know it exist, to the Swedish legation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  How did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">How did you come into contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  My father's <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> , which I told you, did also foreign legations, people and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And he, at least three years before, two years before, he took picture of Per Anger, who you mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And— [Technical conversation]
QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So let's just start again with how you came to make contact with Wallenberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">My father took his family pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He was a young man then, Per Anger, and his wife and little baby and it's about. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I would say, two years before, this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And he also bought a Leica camera at that time, and I was teaching his wife how to use the camera because of the new baby and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And then, I have seen them weekly as — not friends, but in a friendly > Raoul Wallenberg atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I — every week I — we used to live in the — it's a well-known <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Gerbeaud palace</span> , or the <span class="BUILDING">Gerbeaud building</span> , which was the most famous confectionery 1n all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And in the war, naturally, there was not too many chocolate, and I got a box of chocolate every week, which I gave to his wife, wife, because she loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And when I actually — and it was an escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , though I took it easy and I call it I just stepped aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I, you know — all I knew, my father also had the Swedish passport because he had Swedish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And very little, because I wasn't too much in contact by then with them, but I was able to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And he told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He told me, "You have also Swedish passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And that gave me the idea that I go, when I escape the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , to — right away, next morning, to go to the Swedish legation and look for Per Anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Now, the way it actually happened was there were hundreds of people, that was on the Buda side, hundreds of people waiting in front of the legation asking for the Swedish passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But the policeman didn't let them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So somehow I worked my way to the policeman, and I asked him, "Would you please send a message to Per Anger that Thomas Veres is here and would like to speak to him." </span><span class="sentence" id="160">In about a half an hour, somebody came out, two other policemen, and said — made on the loud speaker announcement that everybody should immediately leave the territory of the Swedish legation, immediately, except Thomas Veres. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And a cold sweat was coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And they let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I met Per Anger, and he said, "What can I do for you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I said, "Look, I just left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , and I'm asking you what you could help." "</span><span class="sentence" id="165">Oh, I introduce you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And a young man came in. "</span><span class="sentence" id="167">Raoul," he said, "this is Thomas Veres, friend of mine, photographer." "</span><span class="sentence" id="168">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">You will be my photographer." </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And in ten minutes the official paper was made out that Thomas Veres is the official photographer of the Swedish legation of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And Wallenberg signed it, and he gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I never used that paper because it wouldn't mean anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But he said, "From now on, you will be my photographer, and you will do documentary what we are doing here for the outside world to show what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You will report directly to me" — not to the usual people who were working on the passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And that's how I became his photographer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Do you know —
ANSWER:  Did I know what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  What you were getting into?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">As a matter of fact, I was a little bit skeptical — not a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I was quite skeptical to — “how am I going to take pictures?” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And slowly, I learned my lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">First I did, as I told you before, many of the actual passport pictures of people who needed it for him, not for direct, not for the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">What we did when he did save people and they didn't have the Swedish papers, we reversed the action. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I did the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In the meantime, the officers did the passport, and the two were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was a post-issued passport, which didn't say it, but that's how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">When the actual — Can we stop here? </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I'd like to drink. [</span><span class="sentence" id="190">Technical conversation]
QUESTION:  Did Wallenberg tell you why he wanted a photographer with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Remember, I told you that he said for documentary to show to the outside world what's happening, in his words, as a documentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Now, I started saying if I remember that one morning, which is November — end of November, I think it was either 27", 28th or 28", 29, in the morning, because at that time my parents were still in the <span class="BUILDING">Gerbeaud house</span> in our old <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">During the day I was with the Swedish legation, what I told you doing passport pictures until then. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And then one morning, early morning — he used to start early morning, so did I. Even up to today. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I was there before seven o'clock or 6:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And a small, handwritten note wait for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And his secretary said, "Tom, Wallenberg sent this note to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And the note said that "Wait" — "Come out to the — meet” — no, I'm sorry, "Meet me at the <span class="BUILDING">Jozsefvarosi Palyaudvar</span> ," which is the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> at the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and it's a <span class="BUILDING">freight station</span> , not for the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I have never been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And I went out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I get there and the whole <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> was surrounded by Hungarian gendarmes, and there I was with a camera in my pocket with Wallenberg's note. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">He was quite, I call it naive, of those dangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Even if he realize it, he tried to somehow minimize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So I went to the first gendarme and I started to say half German, half English, half Hungarian, trying to imitate I'm from the Swedish legation and I want to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And the guy looked at me like, "Who wants to go in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So I talk my — I had to talk my way in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I didn't show them any paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That would be the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">My mouth took me in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> had about 10,000, 15,000 men, Jews, ready for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They were the ones who were surrounded from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , who were still at that time, end of November, sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Later on, it was on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">This time it was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And Wallenberg was there and set up a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And I went to him and he whispered in my ear, "Tom, take as many pictures as you can." </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I didn't want to ask him "Will you pose for me" or, you know, "How?" </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So I had my coat on me and I had a shawl, and I always have a pocketknife with me, and I made a slit in the shawl and prearranged the camera setting on my Leica, and I just — through the shawl I did bring just the lens out and started, through the shawl, shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Sometimes I was sitting in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and shooting from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and sometimes I just went around looking left or right like nothing happened and take the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Up till — first of all, somebody was yelling to me, "Tommy, Tommy." </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was not my best, but one of my best friends with whom I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from first grade until the end of my schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We were sitting next to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So I didn't want to be recognized, and I whispered to him, you know, "Do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And I kicked him in the butt, and I said, "Dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Go over there," in Hungarian; that the <span class="DLF">line</span> was standing for information to give that you have Schutzpass* or not, because that's what Wallenberg in a big book had to verify it, “yes, no, yes, no.” * </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Protective pass (German) And he was trying, naturally, also for the ones who didn't have it, to say “yes,” and go to the left, go to the right, go to left, go to right. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">End Tape 1 Tape 2
QUESTION:  Tom, as you pick up on your description of that, could you mention something about the kind of danger that you faced and what the danger of taking photographs was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  That's self explanatory. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">What I wanted to follow-up, the next thing I heard, again, "Tommy, Tommy." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And this was a first cousin of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And the same thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The idiot start, "Tommy, Tommy." </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I said — I kicked him in the butt, too. "</span><span class="sentence" id="235">Dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Go over there." </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And the third one, which I remember, I can recall, I saw in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He was a very well known Hungarian actor, theatrical actor. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And usually he played farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He was a Jew, but he played farmer, Hungarian farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">He was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">He was standing in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And he didn't have — I went to him, and I whispered to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He didn't have the passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> , and I whispered to him, "That's a famous Hungarian actor, well-known Hungarian actor.” </span><span class="sentence" id="246">He let him go, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He looked at the book; “yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The interesting part of that one was that maybe two or three years later the same actor who was again in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> came to my <span class="BUILDING">photo shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And naturally he never saw me before. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I said to him, "Have you been 1n the Jozsefvarosi Palyaudvar?" </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And he said, "Yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I said to him, "Do you know who was the one?" </span><span class="sentence" id="253">He didn't — He looked like he didn't believe me, that I was actually the one who saved his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But he was nice, but then, nothing special. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">You asked me about if there was any danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So that was the second — I was there two days, and then this kind of deportation start. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">From then on they started taking people on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And on the second day, there was a friend of mine, too, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And while the procedure was going on, and taking picture, "Let's see what's happening behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And we slid behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and they were already ready and closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">All you saw in those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> , you had clear <span class="DLF">windows</span> with wrought iron. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And hands were sticking out and yelling and crying, "Help, help." </span><span class="sentence" id="263">You heard people, "Help me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I give you 100,000 pengo," and this and that, and "I own a <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> here." </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So it was a terrible thing, because you only heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So with my friend, we slip closer to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and start — it opened amazingly easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Started to open one <span class="DLF">door</span> , and people slowly — the wood panel which they walked up was still there, and slowly they started to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And we were trying to tell them to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ; that's where the procedure is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And didn't notice in the big excitement that slowly whispering, "Hungarian police officer." </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I'm saying "Hungarian police officer," because in the whole thing there was only one German involved, and his name was Dannecker?. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He was the right-hand of Eichmann® who wasn't there that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The rest of it was Hungarian gendarmes. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The German, Dannecker, he just stood there silently like he's not doing the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And the couple of Hungarian higher-up, and he was a captain, and he noticed me and started yelling in Hungarian, "Stop immediately." </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And then pulled his revolver, aiming. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Meantime, Wallenberg came over too, somehow, luckily. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">With the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , they pulled over and pulled up and said, "Jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Tom, jump!" </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I would have gotten the Olympic record for this, because I jumped so fast that I jumped in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And we closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> and pulled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">> Theodor Dannecker © Adolf Eichmann They were yelling after us, and that was the last time we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Wallenberg said jokingly, "We cannot come back here." </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So that was the — that showed a little bit of danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Next, your question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  How long had you been working with Wallenberg by then? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I mean, it's hard for us to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">This is compressed into a few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  My whole affiliation, in lifetime, it's very short. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But it was somehow one of my — one of my longest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was actually, I can tell you, October 17 when I met him first — I think it was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Either 17 — I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I can tell you another danger that has nothing to do with the legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Yeah, it was October 17, until I have seen him the last time January the 14th. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And that's the whole period. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">You asked me that; right?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Not only that. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Other instance, which just give you one idea — First of all, the Swedish legation had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> under somebody's command which was called Schiitzlingsprotokoll,’ which is in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I don't know if you speak any German. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It's called Schutzlingsprotokoll. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">In that young men were having all kinds of uniforms starting from priest to soldier to Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And when they came in for help, these young men have been going out like — as I said, depending on the situation, in certain uniforms and trying to bring people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Now, that was not Wallenberg's personal, but it was under his command. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It happened that one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> — I did many things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">When, for instance, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">International Ghetto</span> was built, I'm sure you heard about it, it was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">International Ghetto</span> , where not only the Swedish but different other legation who had imitated the Swedish success, Swiss, <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And was — a certain part in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">International Ghetto</span> which was under protection of different legations. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And when there was need for it, I was there for a day to try to get people in, because all the people who lived there, had to go out if they were Christians, and the Jews were coming 1n under Swedish protection or any other protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There were — because the plan of the Nazi government was — Hungarian Nazi government was, up till then, from March 19....

<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  Tell us everything. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Protégé protocol (German)
ANSWER:  Up till March 19, start — they did not put the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They named certain <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> yellow-star <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which was mostly occupied by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But that was all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Certain <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, the next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> wasn't, and they were called yellow-star <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Now, the plan of the Hungarian Nazi government was, at the end, to empty all those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and put them in the actual <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which there was a ghetto which was not done and not established, actually, by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It was its own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">European city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Mostly for the very orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And they lived there for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But as I said, they were concentrated — it was concentration by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">First in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and then to put them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then to kill the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">That was the plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Now, the Swedish or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">International Ghetto</span> was these people with passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And not in those, but in one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which was a yellow-star <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I was with Wallenberg, and the phone said that one of the yellow-star <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had been taken away by the Arrow Cross, which 1s the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So Wallenberg said to me, "Let's go." </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I went too, not as photographer, but as interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">With him I spoke either German or English. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I knew a little English. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And we arrived to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I don't know what <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There was one Arrow Cross officer who was not only Arrow Cross, but he was — it is hard to translate it from Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was a — a certain organization of the Arrow Cross, to put it this way, who was designated strictly for killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So this captain was there from the Arrow Cross, and Wallenberg told me — I was the interpreter — "Ask him where are the Jews," because there was nobody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He said, "In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> ."

QUESTION:  It strikes me that you were all actually very young, younger than we think looking, say, at Wallenberg's pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Could you talk something about your — the youth of the people involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">How old was Wallenberg?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  He was born in 1912, so thirty — can you count? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">He was born in 1912. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So 32. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Yeah, he was 32. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Now, the people involved, except that organization which I told you that — the Schutzlingsprotokoll, they — all of them were older than I was; yes, quite older. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And the technicality, because it was a big organization and a fantastic organization; very well organized, issuing the passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Now, his idea was to make them, because the Germans — and that was not with the Hungarians; mostly with the Germans — they like legality, and he wanted to make it real legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And all his speaking with the Hungarian Nazi government or with the Germans, he was proving — in other words, it wasn't just a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was all the documents behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Like if it called — it was needed — excuse me — Swedish connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">The Swedish, the letters, proving the Swedish connection have been all documented with each passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Against that was the Swiss legations organization who had issued to anybody, without any paperwork background, which that's why it took away a lot from the Swedish organization in legality. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And — and also, it was not recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Or if 1t was, it was not recognized like the Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the reason for that was, that he was a good man, but he did not take as part in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">His name was Lutz,® who was the Swiss legation's — head of the Swiss legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And he did not take part just — as Wallenberg did, bodily and in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So the Swiss legation was called the Baross utca, and anybody — and there would be crowds there. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">When there was — sooner or later, they just started up without any paperwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Now, to some people this was right; to some people this was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I don't know if I under— I make myself understand why, but behind the Swiss legations, which was not in the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss legation building</span> — it was in the <span class="BUILDING">Baross utca</span> , it was called — was mostly the Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They were under the cover of Swiss legation doing — they were mostly Zionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  It strikes me that a lot of what Wallenberg did, because he was acting so quickly and improvising actions all the time —
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  — depended a great deal on, as it must have for all of you, speaking different languages, taking each day or each hour as it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And also what you're referring to, it seems to me that he understood the nature of the Nazi respect for bureaucracy—

<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  ...and he took advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

QUESTION:  You were asked whether you were sleeping in your own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during part of this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Ihave been sleeping in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all — all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I have to think back. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">First of all, it happened just the day when, after — hold on a second — after the Nazis took over and I was still in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And I wanted to know, because I had the right from my captain, as I told you, to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And that weekend, when the Nazis took over, I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And then I had to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and I was there for two days, or a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But I was quite concerned what's happening to my parents because the Nazi government took away the exemptions which Horthy gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They nullified it. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So I— another officer with whom I was well, friendship, I told him and he said, "T'll come with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I do have, anyway, some pictures to develop and that will be a good excuse." </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So we went to the — my parents' <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I started to develop. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">He came with me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">darkroom</span> , looking at this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And suddenly, the bell started non-stop ringing, the doorbell. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Now, that was a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you must understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It wasn't only the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It was the <span class="INT_SPACE">darkroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">It was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> are all in a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , like <span class="BUILDING">top penthouse</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I was in the dark in the <span class="INT_SPACE">darkroom</span> and I heard voices, "We are looking for the Jew who came in." </span><span class="sentence" id="494">That was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Now, nobody would call me a Jew because I didn't have my armband, so somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who knew me reported it. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So in the dark I was still developing. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I took off my ring, I took off my [gesturing]. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I knew they came for me, particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So when I finished up the development, I didn't want to ruin, but my heart was pounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So I go out and there is my friend, the officer, Hungarian army officer he was, and three Hungarian Nazis from the Arrow Cross dressed in Arrow Cross uniform with machine guns, with hand grenade, with revolver; name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They were armed to the [gesturing]. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And they started to question me. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So my friend the officer, army officer, pulled his revolver and said, "He's with me and nobody is harming him. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He's doing work for the Army." </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And then I recognize. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">One of them was working downstairs in that <span class="BUILDING">confectionery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And he came to me quite — he recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He's a good Hungarian boy." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And he left because my friend pulled his revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They were playing with the hand grenades like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">After the war, a year later I was just shooting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , and a detective came with somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He said that this guy was arrested; that he killed I don't know how many Jews, and "He is calling that he saved your life, and he wants your help." </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was the Hungarian Arrow Cross guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I said, "How many people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He said, "Hundreds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He was taking them down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="520">What would you do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I'm asking you the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">What would you do in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Because he was calling me as a witness that I save his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Answer me. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">What would you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That's one occasion I'm asking you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And I saw — Whether I was right or wrong, I said, "I never saw him before." </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I figured he may have saved me — he was not the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It was my friend, the captain, who saved my life because he pulled his — how do I know how many hundreds of other people he killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">That's — I wanted to tell this because ever since, if it comes up in me: Did I do right or wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I could have saved the life maybe, but my testimony, I cannot go against the other people who he killed — that's number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Number two, he was not actually the one. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He came to me, because many times I went through this, after I was already saved, after he pulled the gun, after he said then "Get out of here," my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So the question was — Yeah, I slept <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Now, after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> story, Wallenberg told me that, "I need this very fast because I want to send it with the next pouch, diplomatic pouch, to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="537">When do you need it?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="538">Tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">During the nighttime I print it. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And this is why I don't know how many — I know I printed 12 prints of each. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And there were a lot of pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I took the pictures and the negatives, and it was already getting dark, and I knew he was — Wallenberg was waiting for me at the legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And I was, at that time, mostly dressed not exactly, but similar to the Nazi uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I had boots, I had black riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So — I didn't wear the armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So I had the pictures, and I went, naturally, on foot to the legation from my parents' <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was getting dark, and on one part of the trip was a narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I have seen people asking for identification over there, and they were Arrow Cross people. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So I went to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I was zigzagging until I reached the big square, and by that time it was really dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And that Arrow Cross guy was also asking for — but I was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He was that close, as you to me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And with a lamp, he was putting the lamp — you know, small lamp with batteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Flashlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">You see? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Flashlight, and asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And there was somebody just showing his identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So I had to make up my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">If I stop and go this way, he would shoot after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So I kept going, and when I reached him, the pictures were in my left hand, I said the Hungarian Nazi salute — like “Heil Hitler,” “Eljen Szalasi.!” </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And he greeted me back like this [gesturing], and I kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And when I told — I reached the legation and I told Wallenberg what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I was still out of breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And he told me, "Tom, this is getting really dangerous, so from now on you give me all the negatives undeveloped and we'll take care out there." </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So that was the last time I saw these pictures and the negatives, and all the other negatives that I did later. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Now, I still didn't answer the question how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So one day shortly after this, which had to be the beginning of December, the fighting was — and the air raids were so heavy that I — but the phones were up to the last moment on. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So it was so heavy fighting that I called my parents. "</span><span class="sentence" id="569">I can't get through." </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was really very dangerous. "</span><span class="sentence" id="571">I'm going to sleep here." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And from then on I was sleeping at the Ulloi ut legation. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And that's where, later on — I don't know if you know that story, which was January the 10th, two days after the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , when we were up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">One night, it was a snowy night, and one night the Arrow Cross came and the whole legation was taken to the Arrow Cross place, a department of one of the Arrow Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So I knew this is the end again. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I had some false identification with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I told you, I didn't believe in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">That was for the Red Cross, and it had red canvas binding. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Very nice papers they were, stating that I worked for the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">Arrow Cross house</span> , I ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It tasted very badly, but I ate it little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And I didn't want them to find it on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And there were too many people. ” </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Hail Hitler (German) ' Long live (Ferenc) Szdlasi (Hungarian) Everybody from the whole legation was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Don't ask me how many, because — well over a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So when we got to one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they wanted to put us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , I heard the Arrow Cross yelling at each other, "Put them on top of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">They're going to die anyway." </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And then they didn't put them because there wasn't <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us, so they took it to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and started to — They liked my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Right away I found customer. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They said, "This is mine." </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And we were standing next to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , hands up, and there was an old little guy there who was always very — he was a very nice person, but he always asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And as we were standing next to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> ready to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> for, you know, he is asking me, "Mr. Veres, do you know which way is the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So I think I didn't lose my sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I told him, "Once the shooting starts, you know we'll be there." </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And the next moment a truckload of Hungarian policemen came with Wallenberg heading. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">What happened that the Arrow Cross did not note is on the other <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there was a phone connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was phones, the woman who was doing the phones, who was the daughter of the head of the department, phoned Wallenberg and reached him. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And he collected a truckload of Hungarian policemen, and they came with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And they came in and he said that, "These are my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You cannot touch them," and took everybody out.</span></p>
