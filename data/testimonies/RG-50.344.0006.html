QUESTION:  April? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">March, April?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Must have been, cause I know we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in Christmastime and then -- yeah, it must have been early spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We had -- we slept on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> and we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air mattresses</span> , and so it was fairly comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The only thing was the showering and bathing and all, that was rather difficult, but then we started to get patients there to take care of, they were bringing some back from the front and we got our first experience there of actually being an <span class="BUILDING">evacuation hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  And how was that different from what you’d done before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Oh, oh it was quite different, because you were all set up in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , you know and it was -- well, you know, it -- it -- the -- the general <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I think that must have been a regular <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that they had taken over and they had all the facilities, whereas out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , you -- you know -- you didn’t -- you just had temporary, makeshift things, but it didn’t seem as though we were there too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">As I said, I can’t remember all this.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Not -- not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We knew we weren’t right up on the <span class="DLF">front line</span> , we were far enough back, that -- and --
QUESTION:  Did you talk to the injured men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Oh, yeah, I talked to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  What did they want to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Most of them wanted to talk about their girls back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and how homesick they were and couldn’t wait til they got back and if they weren’t injured very much, they said, “Oh, this means I’ve got to go back into the war -- fighting again,” you know, and I -- but others that were being -- that’s -- if they were more seriously wounded, were shipped back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then they vess eventually they went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or were taken care of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I think it was there that we got word that one of our nurse’s husban -- it was at -- yes, it was at the Battle of the Bulge and her husband was lost and reported as either dead or a prisoner of war and then as we went along -- can’t remember where we were, Mike showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And that was exciting, you know, that he was actually a -- a prisoner, taken a prisoner and a colonel friend set them up in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they were able to be together there. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Then we moved on -- oh, we had to get our Eisenhower jackets or something, so we all piled in the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and went into --
QUESTION:  What were those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  They were those short jackets that -- they named them after Eisenhower because I believe he wore them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And we didn’t have them to -- to go on further, so we drove into July 15, 1998 <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and oh, those people were just so happy to see the Americans, they were so friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And --
QUESTION:  Why did you have to get those jackets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  I don’t -- I guess it was accepted ca -- to wear in the <span class="REGION">battle areas</span> , or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I don’t remember, but I know we were told we had to go up there, so we got in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and went along and were singing the army songs as we went up to pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And then shortly after that we must have moved out and I --remember exactly where we went from there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, it was an experience that I would never have wanted to miss. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I felt that, you know, we did a lot of good and got a lot out of it my-myself, I enjoyed it and I’d do it again if -- if the opportunity had come, you know, if I was to go into the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Not now, but, you know -- but I really thought it was a very rewarding experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Patients were all so very happy you know, were glad to see you and you felt that -- as I said, you felt you were doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I felt I was doing more there than I would have been if I went to work in a -- a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or -- here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> or, you know, into one of the -- couple of my friends went into the -- like Sikorsky’s and different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , worked as industrial nurses, but I thought being an army nurse was the best.</span></p>
