<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell me your name please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Abraham Malach.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born uh on uh May 12th, 1935, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolen</span> , which is in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> , uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolen</span> being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about ten thousand people at the time uh half of which was Jewish and that was about five thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And uh when the war broke out...
QUESTION:  Before the war, tell me about the memories you have of your family before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Uh my uh from my immediate family uh I have only a few uh memories uh but I know that uh there was uh twelve children on my mother's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Uh there were twelve brothers and sisters of which only one survived the war, they having escaped in 1933 to uh what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and from my father's side uh where there were eight brother and and sisters, uh none of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> uh where I still saw uh the uh uncles and aunts and uh both sets of grandparents until 1941 uh I was able to see them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What did your father do? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">What was his business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Uh my father was in the leather business, wholesaling. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">There were uh the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolen</span> , which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews uh uh were the tanners; and uh then uh uh the finishers of leather and uh shipping it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to the uh manufacturers of uh shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So he was, he was one of those that were wholesaling the uh the leather goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  You were telling me some stories before the camera started of what you remember from when you were four years old and before the Nazis came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well uh, there are there are pictures that remain with you like uh you see in flashbacks in movies sometimes and uh for me it's in real life several uh pictures that are alive to this day, and that would be like the first telephone uh that was installed in just before the war broke out and the reason that I would remember it is that uh I would watch people walking to uh talking to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and uh that uh was such a wonder to me that uh I couldn't explain it and it's remained with me to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">People walking up to this certain <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and talking to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But uh the next uh flashback would uh be uh when the war broke out and I was four years old, in 1939 the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> coming over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and uh flying low and uh dropping their bombs and everybody running to shelter and uh screaming and just not running fast enough or uh one obstructing to wait for the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The panic that uh ensued. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Tell me about those, just keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Tell me about what you did when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Who was in your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Sisters and brothers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Uh my uh in my immediate family we uh were four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And uh it was my uh sister who was five years older, a brother who was uh almost three years older, and then I had a S1...a younger sister (cough), excuse me, who was born in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh after the war broke out and we uh were put into the uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , uh sometime uh in 1940 we were uh put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> uh where they would take a whole section and uh keep all the Jews, collect all the Jews uh from the neighboring uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh we stayed in the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> until about 1942...
QUESTION:  What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Uh, from the life in uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I have only uh few uh memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But uh I remember that uh my mother had been uh kept at the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> for a while and when she came back emaciated and so this picture that comes back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Of course I later learned the reason that uh she had been uh kept at the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> was that uh my father had uh uh a lot of uh being that he was wealthy and uh had connections with the leading uh members of the community, so even after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized, he was able to uh obtain through uh uh payment a document from the uh uh mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolen</span> and the uh German commissar, the German uh governor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a special document for uh as a merchant and uh supplier of uh the uh uh shoes to the German army and whatever, so he he obtained uh a passport uh so to speak, a uh it was which a document with which he was able to travel and uh the idea was that uh after uh the war broke out and the, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided to the German Russian sphere of influence, uh his uh he owned two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were confiscated so uh we couldn't get no means of escape but uh he was still dreaming of the, to get us uh out somehow uh with money that he still had and influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So it was the travel document uh they plotted a scheme uh that we would uh hire a uh a horse uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawn- carriage</span> and that was to take us to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where the Russians were. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Of course uh when we reached the uh <span class="DLF">bridge</span> uh of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the uh German soldiers were there and uh two uh German soldiers on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> uh would confront us with the carbines on the backs and shout uh, "Alle Juden [zuruck (ph)|, which reverberates to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And uh screaming and the uh weeping by the women and children and nothing helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We were uh driven back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh eventually we were taken, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated and we were taken to uh a uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolanow</span> ; and uh there we stayed from 1942 'til 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But even there, my father had not given up; and uh he had uh uh bribed uh some people that had influence, the uh head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> to uh close an eye to the fact that we uh we would run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They would smuggle out at a certain time at the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And uh it was before uh in December, just before Christmas time that uh we were uh driven on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleigh</span> to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to uh uh to be hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , except that uh the farmer who was hiding us, he had uh visitors and uh these visitors had heard one of the uh children was coughing or what, so that uh the farmer became afraid uh he would be betrayed, uh that he is hiding Jews, and we have to be smuggled back into the camp from which we had escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">That was in 1942, the last chance that uh we uh we had still to uh to be free, after which uh on the raid that uh the Germans uh sent the SS to uh pick up uh old people and uh children, where my youngest sister was four. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She was taken on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> - all the uh screaming and all the yelling - it didn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And uh whether they gassed those people or shot them we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was the last time we saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We stayed uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volanof</span> until 1943 and were taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in uh called uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and uh there we stayed until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh...
QUESTION:  What did you do in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You told me you were a messenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , I uh I was not uh with the uh work squads that were uh going out, uh outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> working in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> uh whether it was munitions or whatever for the uh Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So I uh I cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">police barracks</span> the uh and I served as a messenger boy which proved to be of uh crucial importance when uh the uh when uh uh making these selections to again uh to pick out uh those unable to work whether it was children or elderly or or those that uh became ill and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh I was considered uh important or productive and left alone so uh that when we arrived in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I was listed as fourteen years of age and uh apparently that helped me again uh be considered productive and not taken straight to the ovens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Can you describe your arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Uh up to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and the uh first subsequent uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> we still managed to be living as a uh unit, as a family unit uh even though my younger sister at that point was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh we were still uh with the uh parents as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Before being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> though, uh they uh loaded the uh men in separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the women on separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and uh when the decision was to be made how to divide the children uh I was placed with uh my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They decided, between my parents they decided that I should go with my mother and let my father take only my older brother with him in order to uh have a better chance of escaping from the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> uh when uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slows down or comes to a stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were hoping to be able to uh run away and uh he felt that I was too weak and too young to uh to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And that proved to be uh a blessing that uh I went with the uh women's uh into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> because uh the first selection that they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh in the men's uh camp, they rounded up uh all the youngsters and uh my brother included and uh again he was uh at the time uh about fourteen, maybe going on fifteen whereas I I was only nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They took him with the other uh children to the uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And that being on a uh special day, uh the Jewish New Year, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, which was uh Mengele's uh way of uh uh making a point of uh making selections on uh on uh Jewish events, Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh when we had arrived uh was the height of the uh transports and uh they didn't put us straight into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> because they couldn't handle that many arrivals in a given day, so that we went two weeks uh without a uh number. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Eventually they did take us in and uh we became uh the slaves of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , those that could still uh be useful to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And uh the daily routine was uh for the adults uh working uh in the nearby <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and uh I was uh a messenger and so on. (</span><span class="sentence" id="61">Pause) What uh got me to uh be able to survive the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh camp was a uh incident uh where a kapo had seen me with uh my uh mother and my sister at one time and uh she took a great uh liking to me or pity on me, and she would uh call me to her uh <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> from time to time to feed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There was one incident in which uh I I thought I would never forgive myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">When I returned to the uh to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with my mother and that day not having been fed by the uh kapo I was asking for my uh portion of food which was two slices of bread uh for supper and uh having no breakfast to look forward to and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was uh hungry not having eaten and uh to discover that my uh mother uh didn't expect that and shared the uh meal with my sister who told me that she gave it to my uh sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I carried on at the time, as hungry as I was and made my mother feel guilty and my sister feel guilty which uh I was ashamed of later on for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And uh the thing was that uh as young as I was uh the drive to uh survive was so strong that uh you had to learn fast and uh whether from the kapo or uh by other means - I don't remember - I had somehow managed to get uh ahold of cigarettes and uh when we were separated from uh my mother and from my sister, uh I was able to smuggle to them through a uh cousin of mine cigarettes that they should be able, in order for them to exchange for uh for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself an incident that uh only many years later I could comprehend what was happening to me when uh the same uh kapo had uh brought one day to uh her <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and uh during the daytime when everybody was out to work she had uh commandeered a uh a young attractive woman to wash me up and uh talking nicely to me that it's important to be clean and uh that girl carefully washed me and fondled me and then uh that kapo took me uh on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and uh tried to arouse me and uh as a nine year old boy uh lying beside her, on top of her and in any kind of position, whatever she tried uh must have have been futile, futile but uh that was the life in the camp for this poor woman. (</span><span class="sentence" id="68">Pause) They were a degra...degradation that uh they put people to uh to the point that uh living was not worth living. (</span><span class="sentence" id="69">Pause) And then uh remembering uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , being liberated when the Germans retreated ...
QUESTION:  Can you tell me, tell me first about the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You told me about the woman kapo and her salami. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Tell me a little more about the kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It's OK. (</span><span class="sentence" id="74">Pause) Tell me as much about her as you can. (</span><span class="sentence" id="75">Pause)
ANSWER:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Uh uh one of the things that uh uh I had constantly uh in my mind was uh the vision the kapo having a uh round uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> uh sort of like this side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> but taller and a uh shelf on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was covered with a uh uh some kind of table cloth but on the second shelf being a piece of salami and bread at your disposal. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And the idea that you would, you can uh eat your uh your meal and uh have some left over, have uh extra food for later. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was uh the dream, a dream that uh was to be with me for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Uh when we were liberated and uh we were being fed uh by the, at the time we were being cared for by the <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> which was uh the uh relief organization, a Jewish relief organization active all over Europe taking care of the refugees and survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh when we were uh being uh served meals it was not uh a sit-down meal but you had to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> and uh your plate was being filled with the uh different foods and to this day I can remember that asking for uh when they filled my plate for an extra spoon, extra spoon even though uh one would, should have uh known uh after the first or second time around that uh there's no need to fill up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plate</span> that much more than you can eat because uh some of it won't stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plate</span> and you wouldn't be able to finish the meal or uh it took a long time to adjust and to know that uh you uh you take what you feel you won't uh you'll eat and if you're not uh satisfied, that you can go back and get a second portion - took weeks before the mind (pause)
QUESTION:  Take a minute and if you can go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> one more time. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You told me about an incident with the kapo and a toy. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Can you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yeah. (</span><span class="sentence" id="85">Pause)
QUESTION:  Take your time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  (Pause - drinking water) Uh, at one point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh that after I had met this kapo and uh as I mentioned uh if not for the food and occasionally a piece of clothing - she had a uh coat commandeered for me uh because uh when people arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they were uh, their clothes with the outer belongings they may have still had with them, was taken away and uh we were given that uh pajama type uh prisoner's garb uh striped prisoner's garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">She somehow managed to get me a coat one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Shoes and another time uh wanted to give me a toy that I refused and uh I pointed out to her that uh my brother was taken to the uh to the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and uh this particular story I didn't uh, I cannot say that I recollect having that conversation and but uh she told it to my mother, that I refused the toy and my mother had talked to me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Why did you refuse the toy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I refused the toy uh pointing to the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and telling her that uh how can I play when uh my brother was taken to the uh <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We could see from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that uh tall <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , the flame uh going up day and night, smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And uh the picture of a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Having gone through that uh once in your lifetime and you will never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh the uh infamous uh Dr. Mengele, he would stand at the head of the uh column of the procession of uh naked people and uh some way before reaching, uh coming up in front of Mengele, we saw that uh there's left and there's right and uh what he was doing is he would uh people would march up in front of him and uh he would look at them and whether they are still able bodied or not, able to contribute uh toward the work, to the labor in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So uh when my turn came, and somebody was whispering to me uh to the right, and somehow I uh managed to stay in that right <span class="DLF">lane</span> without being uh motioned back to the <span class="DLF">left lane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That's what uh made the difference of life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Can you recall children? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Did you see other children at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Uh at some point uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself I was separated uh from my uh sister and from my mother and put in a uh children's uh block. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">In that <span class="DLF">children's block</span> there were not only Jewish children uh but also uh uh Polish and from uh Russian uh war uh prisoners of war, some of them uh even younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Some of them uh uh that uh were still uh babies (pause). </span><span class="sentence" id="103">When uh the Germans retreated and uh they took uh all the inmates on the forced march, they left uh the uh sick children and those that were uh unable to walk... They have been children under the age of six. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Well, I hide among these and other kids; we managed to stay behind until the Russians arrived, and we were liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because those that were taken on the forced march and those that were unable to uh keep up, they were simply shot uh on the uh on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">After we were liberated and uh as I mentioned before I had uh run away from the camp when the uh first Russian soldiers arrived and they had nothing on them but uh they were asking us for cigarettes or asking from us where's the uh supplies, and uh we had managed to find some sugar uh that was not burned and we showed them where the uh there was, where the sugar was. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We took out with us uh a few sacks or whatever to uh and ran away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , myself and two other boys of whom I never heard again. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">These two boys uh may have uh ended up being uh raised by uh some childless family like uh I was supposed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And as the uh the experiment by that couple didn't succeed...
QUESTION:  Back up, because we're not following you. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Let's start - you're running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Where did you run to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Uh from the uh camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to the town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and where a childless couple uh took me in and uh being that they uh worked both of them they would uh uh close me up during the day in their one room shack and uh disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Uh that didn't last very long and I ended up in a uh <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But about uh whether it was uh two weeks or four weeks after liberation, they had organized the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> for all those bodies that uh were collected uh of people that uh had been shot on the march and the retreat when the Germans took with them the, all the rest of the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And uh all kind of bodies that were not cremated but uh left unattended some of them till they starved and whatnot, so there was this uh <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> that the uh and ceremony that they had organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak...Auschwitz</span> with the uh bells, all the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> uh ringing away. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And that day I met I met up with uh the children that uh had stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> uh now were collected by the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and uh I rejoined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Uh everything by chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">If not for that uh I would have been in that <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> uh growing up and uh stayed there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was the uh it was uh to this day I uh I remember the prayers in Polish and the original, the how they were teaching me, the uh Polish nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I would have been a good uh decent Polish uh Catholic to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">After having survived alone the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  What was <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> the camp like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  The uh...
QUESTION:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">What did you do when <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> took you? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Where did they take you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?

<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Uh they were tied up uh at the time already uh in uh in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And uh they had a mind to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> eventually but uh uh they didn't want to keep me uh and uh to go to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , so they sent me ahead and uh sent uh myself and my sister, they sent ahead to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to go to uh a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When I finished uh uh when I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I went back and was uh attended two years uh of the uh <span class="BUILDING">Technische</span> (ph)...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> ; and then went on to uh I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and uh finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , at uh the <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  What was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> like right after the war for you as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  On the uh it wasn't too personal level. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Uh I had uh not seen in Germans any different uh human beings, didn't uh didn't see look at them any different than at other people and uh uh did not uh feel uh outright uh anti-Semitism among the people except when you traveled to the small uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where they would display uh their relatives who were in uniform and you could see and feel the way uh they were uh proud of uh their service to the Reich and in the songs that they were singing that many of them uh they uh they still lived that uh era that they looked at uh as the great era of uh ruling the world and so on, and uh that there were many of those that uh didn't learn a lesson among the older generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But I must say that in the uh <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there were uh a lot of young people who were no different than uh other uh young people in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that uh they did realize uh that you cannot conquer the world and get away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So uh you you had uh among them these uh uh young people that uh would stand up for causes of uh democracy and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Can we go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Were there other children that you came in contact with during those years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Uh I don't recall much of uh the uh children that I was with uh except those a few a few of those that uh survived with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And uh we uh uh were not uh in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh kept much uh like a a normal setting where you uh make friend...friendships and so on where you have an occasion to play with children and to get to know them much. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Whether it was uh on uh appells, which meant uh being lined up uh for muster and uh that could take uh hours of your time, or what uh as some other tasks of cleaning, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Uh but no socializing per se.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  What was living with your mother and your sister in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">women's barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">What, can you describe that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Can you describe what your life was like in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  The uh <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> uh would <span class="BUILDING">house</span> uh, well 1t consisted of uh metal corrugated uh structures uh that uh had these uh two-tiered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , wooden uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They're wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And uh how we managed to uh to sleep without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> or whatever, it's beyond me and uh working uh to uh <span class="NPIP">outside</span> when uh being taken to work in the winter time in these harsh uh uh winter days in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with uh inadequate clothing and not having uh a coat and pneumonia the first time around uh it's beyond me. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But uh uh it seems that uh human beings are capable of uh surviving uh great hardships uh and still come out alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And that's one of the things that uh looking back when you uh when you hear, when you read of how it uh German uh uh doctors would come and conduct experiments on human beings, to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Did your mother and sister try to protect you ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  To the extent uh possible but uh you were uh subject to uh their total control (cough) and wasn't uh a matter of being able to intercede on behalf of uh your beloved ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">When my uh smaller sister was taken from uh literally from my mother's arms and uh would have preferred to uh die in her <span class="NPIP">place</span> and uh there was no way of her to to stop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> just took off and they uh they beat her down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , my mother and uh could do nothing and uh I can imagine uh after the war for all these years to have to live with such memories, what it means to uh to or to my father for that matter, that he couldn't uh that he couldn't protect my brother and that the uh guilt feeling, uh him feeling that uh he had uh taken my brother with him rather than having sent him with me uh and that in turn may make him feel guilty if uh if I was able to survive and uh if he had let my older brother go together with me that he maybe he would have survived too. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But that was the decision at that time, that uh he though he would be able to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="186">Pause) Up to uh up to a certain point yes, uh my parents were able to uh when they still had uh they had money and uh where their connections were able to uh do something for them, but when you reached uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were stripped uh of our belongings and uh reduced to uh to objects that they could do with uh whatever they wanted. (</span><span class="sentence" id="187">Pause) You ask yourself uh how is it possible and uh (pause) to this day when I uh after having uh read and trying to understand uh that whole episode of human history, how is it possible in the 20th century for a thing like this to happen and uh there's contradictory feelings and uh (pause) to try to explain rationally - there's no explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">To try to say that uh (pause) once the people were told uh that this is the policy of the government and uh therefore the lower echelon would accept it and go and follow through. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It's one thing when you're uh when you're told to go along and uh and people uh may have tendencies of uh not to care about other people uh when can be possible but uh you're talking of an entire <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> and more than one nation that participated in this, meaning uh educated and uh people with uh feelings, poets, writers.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  (Pause) It uh it must have been uh maybe reduced uh a little bit of human life to the life of uh of a crude animal uh where survival is the only thing and it makes me wonder uh how do people come out of this uh intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That all uh all you learn is uh (pause) that uh that there are uh it's uh hunters and there are those that are hunted. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And uh it's, it must have taken years to for me to uh to understand uh what life is all about but uh (pause) again uh to come back to uh the after all this time uh that uh passed and I I uh I read some of the uh some of the books written about that era, and uh of the people uh that participated 1n it; and it's so hard to understand uh how uh you can find so many beasts that uh took pleasure in uh executing these orders and and participating in the actual cruelties. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I hope when you talk of Eichmann, that people like Eichmann, who...uh Albert Speer I can rationalize, but I can say they were uh people that uh were at the beginning of their careers. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They were in their early thirties or not even thirty, and getting uh high positions and uh power and uh influence which uh made their sense their senses so it made them uh drunk with power and they were capable of uh doing anything that uh...
