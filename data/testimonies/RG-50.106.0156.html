<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My father’s name was Simcha or Siegfried Munzer, or Minzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And he was born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanczuga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And he was born in 1904. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My mother August 4, 2002 was born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the same general area, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rymanow</span> , and she was born May 20", we th -- 1905 officially, but it could have been, it probably was more likely 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And when did they come to the nether -- <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , and what brought them to that <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My father came to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> in the late 20’s, and my mother came to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And my father came there to -- to start a -- a business, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Conditions for Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were not ideal. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He came from a large family of tailors and he decided to start his own tailoring business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And then my mother joined him there about four years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">She was also -- they were actually cousins, so they shared the same last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And she initially left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rymanow</span> in the impr -- the end of the 20’s probably, maybe beginning 30’s and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to join a sister and a brother who were -- already lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And she worked in their tailoring business, and then came to join my father, and they were married in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> in 1930 --
QUESTION:  Two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  -- Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  December 16", 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Right, December 16", 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  And then when did they begin a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  They -- I had -- they had two children before I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My oldest sister Eva was born in 1936, and my younger sister Leana was born in 1938 and then I followed in 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Were your parents very religious, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  They both came from very re-religious backgrounds, very typical eastern European, but they were also part of the -- the enlightenment, if you will, and so they -- they experimented, when they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And some of their closest friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> were actually not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">They -- they observed, you know, the Jewish holidays, certainly, but they -- they did make a break with the very rigid, and what they considered, I think, constraining and confining religion of their bankr -- background in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Now obviously I know what you’re telling me is what your mother told you, cause you haven’t been born yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">How much education did they have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  I’m not entirely sure, my -- they -- they both, I think, had a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education, essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Neither one of them went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And to a large extent also were self educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My mother read a tremendous amount, was a voracious reader throughout her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And my father was also a fairly educated man, apparently very interested in world affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  Was there an extended family in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  In the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> there was -- my father had a brother by the name of Emil, Emil Munzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I think that that’s -- that’s really an -- all we had in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There were some close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">There was another Emil, an Emil Landau who I subsequently met because he happened -- he lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and you know, he happened to -- to marry, actually, someone who became a part of our life much, much later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And so we became very close friends with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But he was very close with -- with both my father and with my Uncle Emil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  But -- but he was not a blood relative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  My uncle --
QUESTION:  No, no, Emil Landau.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Emil Landau was not a blood bra -- blood relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The only blood relatives that I know of in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was my Uncle Emil, my father’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">All of the others were either -- either remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The location of -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> actually was changed quite frequently throughout history. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And the [indecipherable] some of them were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  And on your mother’s side there was no rela -- there were no relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  On my mother’s side, as far as I know, there were no relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  And wh-what do you know of the conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> before you were born? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Did your mother tell you about any tightening restrictions or any sense of danger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Certainly the -- you know, she did tell me about the -- the -- the -- the gradual tightening of the screws after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Which was May 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  That’s right, May 1940 and the confiscation of -- of Jewish property, the banning of Jews from -- from various positions in the arts, or in -- in -- 1n business. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Just a very -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah, ritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I think they try -- my -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as normally as possible in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I’m not sure how directly threatened they felt in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">As far as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I think they -- they -- they really felt very secure in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And then your mother became pregnant with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Certainly by the time my mother became pregnant with me, conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had really deteriorated a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">By then the -- the occupation was in full swing, and this was an unplanned pregnancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my mother was advised in August 4, 2002 very strong terms by her obstetrician to have an abortion. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He told her that it would be immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And my mother, this is one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of Hannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story, my mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">As aresult of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do with her, and so I was -- I was born not in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but I was born at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> actually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an obstetrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said, November 23", 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and that’s whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Again my -- my parents friends advised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and then the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father that I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and my father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular bris. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They’re very remarkable photographs, they’re very, very tiny, they’re only about one by one and a half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year- subsequent years when she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  So you were born, you were circumcised and then the next development?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the following May ts -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That’s when Jews began -- were deported openly in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the -- the first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father, to -- to go to a so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a hernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , had the operation and that delayed his -- his going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt, which gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric ho- hospital</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , called The Remarkkliniek. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And that’s -- so he entered there, basically under the pretext of being a patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My mother, in the meantime, began to look for <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> for my sisters and for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The f -- my father -- my parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should -- should hide in -- in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , so that if -- if one person were killed or found out, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the others would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko, K-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They were very, very close August 4, 2002 to us, very religious Catholic and they were instrumental in several things. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">First they -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And then through their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> which I have visited since then, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a father by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-I-l-i-n-g, and I right now can’t remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were instrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The woman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She had had a vision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And th-that’s what led to my sisters being placed with this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Subsequently, my mother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then eventually to be transferred to a safer <span class="NPIP">place</span> somewhere in the <span class="REGION">Dutch countryside</span> , where most Jewish children apparently were hidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  What -- where -- what -- what was the address of your family’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Wa -- you’re talking about neighbors --
ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It was 100 <span class="DLF">Zoutmanstraat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , and I don’t recall exactly, but they lived on the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , on <span class="DLF">Zoutmanstraat</span> , right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">August 4, 2002 Her name was Annie Madna and that’s -- that’s the woman I was -- I was placed with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  And your family knew her because she was a neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  They were very -- they were close neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She was divorced from her husband, Tolé Madna, who was of Indonesian background. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">She herself was Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And they had had -- they had tw -- three children, and the three children really were apparently in and out of my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">It was a very, very close relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So it was -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine months old at the time when I was placed with Annie. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And at that point my mother sold most of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and belongings and placed a lot of 1tems 1n hiding with our neighbors, basically emptied the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she too, she joined my father in -- in hiding at the same <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric clinic</span> , the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her case, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse’s aid, basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Was she known as his -- his wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There were quite a few Jews who were hiding there in the same way, although I never asked my munther -- my mother exactly how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">She did tell me about the shock it was to her to -- August 4, 2002 to -- to be in a -- inas -- ina <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where people had been confined -- and <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric hospitals</span> at that time were quite different from the <span class="BUILDING">clinics</span> we are accustomed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So these people had been confined for -- for much of their lives and it was a tremendous shock for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My father apparently adapted much better and he found a little clique of -- of Jewish men who were in hiding and they played cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But for my mother it was -- it was much more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Did she have contact with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  She did have contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">As a matter of fact, for Christmas day 1942, the - in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> Christmas is celebrated for two days, but the -- on Christmas day, the - my two sisters were brought to the <span class="BUILDING">Remarkkliniek</span> to visit my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I’m not sure whether that was actually Christmas day, it may have been in -- and I have some notes somewhere -- it may have been the feast of Santa Claus, which 1s also a big deal in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , which is the sixth of December, but I think this was actually f- for -- for Christmas day. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Yeah, it was Christmas day. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And they -- so that that part of the family at least, was reunited that -- one last time. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">This was December 25", 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The following day the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> was invaded by the Germans and apparently was emptied not only of all the Jews who were hiding there, but also of all the patients and the entire staff, they were all taken prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And my parents were taken, first to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">temporary prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , the former home of the philosopher, Dutch August 4, 2002 philosopher Spinoza had been converted into a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then, just within a matter of days really, early in January they were transferred to the first concentration camp, and that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , which is located in the northernmost part of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , my mother told me, initially had been built actually as a receiving center for Jewish refugees fleeing <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  And -- and so they were together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  They remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , I believe for sev -- for -- for several weeks, not a very long period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My mother was put in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> there, of taking care of -- of young children, and it gave her, she said, a sense of security that- that her own children were not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She was really quite glad of that, actually and very grateful that -- that there ha -- was -- that we had found sa -- that she had found safe refuge for all three children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Once she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , was there any contact with -- where y -- where you all were placed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I don’t think -- there was no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I -- I think at that point every attempt was made probably, to keep things as secret as possible, so she did not disclose. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There was some contact later on, and I can mention that now, is actually my mother, on -- on her way subsequently to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , wrote a little August 4, 2002 note on a piece of -- of toilet paper which said, en route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , all is well. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she dropped that on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and she put an address on it, not -- I -- probably to my mother’s neighbors, not to where my sisters were or I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And a railroad worker in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> found the note and it did make its way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I’ve never seen the note, I’m not sure whether my mother saved it or not, but there 1s a very similar note in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So I -- I assume that this was really s- something that was done fairly commonly. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But in any event, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , my- my parents were deported to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> is -- is a -- is a camp located in <span class="REGION">northern hol</span> -- <span class="REGION">northwestern Holland</span> -- <span class="REGION">northeastern Holland</span> , sorry, not far from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eindhoven</span> , and it was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Philips factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And both my parents were put to work in the <span class="BUILDING">Philips factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And at that time they still had contact with each other; although they were separated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> th-they saw each other and still had contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Did your mother talk about her state of mind at that time or your father’s state of mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Just an extreme hope for peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">One of the things that my mother told me that, you know, they had these -- these morning line-ups, and -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And at one point actually they were -- they were visited there by -- by Himmler himself, who told them that as long as they worked, they were in no danger, nothing August 4, 2002 would ever happen to them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="150">indecipherable] Whether it’s at that same <span class="DLF">line</span> -up or one of the others, I mean, very humiliating experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She saw a little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> way in the distance in the du -- <span class="BUILDING">Dutch church</span> on the horizon, and she wondered how -- how wonderful, how it would be if peace would break out at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And she said she would just run to that <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , she didn’t care if 1t was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and just thank God for -- for being freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So she did maintain hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I think that’s -- that’s really what kept my mother going then, and -- and subsequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She never lost hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">She -- she always tried to -- to -- to really make the best of -- of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  And she would have been in her what, mid to late 30’s by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  She was in her -- in her 30’s at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  One of the things which -- which happened really a bit later was -- but which sort of says something about her state of mind I think, is when she was in one of the cattle, the infamous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">She -- she looked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , she was able t-to -- to look at the -- the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , the <span class="REGION">German countryside</span> and -- and realize -- this was springtime and she realized how beautiful it was and she -- she said to herself that after the war we probably would not have much money, but that this still was one way that the family could actually go around and see Europe and still admire the August 4, 2002 beauty of -- of creation. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So that’s -- I think that says something about her state of mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">This was much later, when things were much worse for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Much worse than they were when she was at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  And did she talk about what your father’s state of mind was, there at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Not at that time, but she -- she did tell me about my father’s state of mind actually, earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He kept hoping that the Germans would be defeated by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He had -- he had great faith in th-the -- in history and what happened during the Napoleonic wars, and he -- he felt that when -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> entered the war, he -- he felt it was a strong possibility that the Germans would be defeated in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and that that will be the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But that, of course, was not to be for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And then how long did they stay at this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  ’'m not entirely sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I do have some documents that I could refer to, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Well, why don’t you continue with the story and we can talk about the documents later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I think -- good. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They -- they stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> for sev -- as far as I know, several months and then were transferred from, or tra -- deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That’s where my mother wrote that fame -- that note, which she August 4, 2002 dropped on the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They were still together on arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and were both selected for work -- to -- to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  What did she say about that journey with your father in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  I don’t think they were in th -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They just -- I -- I -- I don’t know, but I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I think men and women were separated, but I’m -- I’m not sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But -- and I d -- I don’t know of any specific conversations what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She did, on arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they -- they -- they both, I think, were very much aware of -- of what the realities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were, there was no -- no hiding it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">You know, she -- she told me of Torah scrolls that were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">She told me of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tallisium</span> that had been com -- made into curtains and sh-she realized that things in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were going to be very, very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My mother somehow found a way to make herself indispensable in -- in many different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The first kind of job that she had actually, was making fur coats for the wives of -- of German generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My mother had never done any kind of tailoring, any kind of work before, hard work, let alone working with fur, but somehow she managed to persuade them that she was able to -- to work with fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And so she made some -- some fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That was her -- her first job. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And then through the grapevine is how she learned that people working in electronics were very essential to the work effort, and that led to a different kind of work, first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but then to a August 4, 2002 transfer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> , which was home of the <span class="BUILDING">Telefunken factory</span> , and there she was put to work assembling radio tubes essential for the war effort and for transmission. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">This is tape number one, side B. You were talking about your mother’s experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Yes, my mother found work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , made herself indispensable first by making fur coats, and then she learned through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> that people who worked in electronics were saved, actually had a way of saving themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And so she started doing that, she claimed that she knew how to -- how to work in electronics, and she was -- that led to a transfer to the <span class="BUILDING">Telefunken factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> , sort of a continuation, if you will, of what she had been doing at <span class="BUILDING">Philips</span> in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> she -- she worked assembling radio tubes. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Her state of mind at that point actually improved, or she took heart from the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> working at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Telefunken</span> , but there were also German soldiers who had been injured on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , many of whom were missing limbs and August 4, 2002 were put to work basically, as best they could in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And their state of mind, they were so anti-Hitler, and anti-Himmler that they would do everything to- to sabotage the effort at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And she took tremendous heart from that, and told me of her own sabotage efforts basically, you know, she would spend the whole day assembling the radio tube, and then when the alarm sounded, or the siren sounds at the end of the day, she would take the -- the entire radio tube apart and put it back in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and then the following day would start the process again, which 1s kind of a daring thing, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But by that time, things like that were quite common.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  What did she say a-about leaving your father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  We didn’t talk about that specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I -- not that I recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Did she have contact with him when they were there together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they still had contact together, but that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> really that they were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I did not realize that until much later, but my father actually remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , amazingly for -- for over a year, before being transferred to another <span class="DLF">hellhole</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It’s -- it’s hard to distinguish the two suddenly -- certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And then he was transferred from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> after being there for several months, to several other, smaller subsidiaries of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steyr</span> and then finally ended up August 4, 2002 in a camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">My mother and I for many years thought that he worked in <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I don’t know where we got that idea from, but there were <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> in- in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And it’s called the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Salzkammergut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And -- but the-these were actually abandoned <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> that were used for assembling of V-2 rockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And that’s where my father di -- where my father worked to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And he -- he remained there through the liberation, survived the liberation by the Americans, and -- but was much too weak, contracted- well, what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> and still without having been able to establish contact with us, two months after the war, on July 25", 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He -- he died in a -- ac -- a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> that had been converted into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims who were very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">My partner Joel and I visited the -- the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , actually, and spoke to one of the sisters about her experience there, and she -- she had -- she was much too young, I think, to have been there, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But she said that -- that literally there were hundreds of inmates who were being cared for, and that people were just also dying on a daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And my father was buried actually, in -- in a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in the former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It’s -- it’s an absolutely beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It is 1m -- un -- it’s unimaginable that -- that horrors like that could have taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It -- it’s - | think it’s one of the most beautiful <span class="NPIP">places</span> on earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  Is that a marked <span class="DLF">grave</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Well, his <span class="DLF">grave</span> originally was marked, and there are some -- some <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> there, because of the tremendous number of people who died immediately after -- they were found dead in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then there were a lot of marked <span class="DLF">graves</span> , but for the sake of -- of uniformity, basically -- initially actually his- his -- the first time my mother visited the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in 1952, there was actually a cross on -- on his <span class="DLF">grave</span> , that we didn’t know -- there were <span class="DLF">Jewish graves</span> that did not have crosses, that had, you know, just plain markers. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We didn't know why there was across on his <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And we didn’t know whether in -- somehow in his last days he had converted, or whatever, what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But we were told at the t -- or she was told at the time that all the markers would be removed because there were far too many errors like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And also because many of the people were unidentified, and so all markers were removed, but we do know exactly where he is buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And to get back to your mother’s experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  My mother eventually -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichenbach</span> was bombed by the allies and the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was destroyed and again showing my mother’s attitude at the time and her continued hope that kept her going was she said the Shechianu prayer, as she saw the flames engulfing the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She said that was one of the greatest joys that she August 4, 2002 had, was seeing that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> going up in flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And then after that she was put on - on one of these many death marches that were occurring and she was just transferred from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> after another, in very, very desperate conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">She told me that she stuffed newspapers around her -- her -- her feet to keep them warm, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And sh -- barely -- she barely had -- had shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Just absolutely desperate conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She did become ill along the way, developed a diarrheal disease, and -- but somehow managed to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  How did she continue to carry the photographs with her, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  My mother told me that the photographs were hidden in her hair, and she told me that her hair -- I asked her whether her hair was ever cut or shaven like -- like most women in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but she said it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I don’t whether that was just -- she was just being discreet with me, but she -- but she claims -- she told me that she had them hidden in her hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">She had the feeling that if these two little photographs of my -- my bris were ever lost, it would mean that I had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And so she really, she held onto those, and I still have those photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Did she have a number on her arm?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Yes, my mother did have a -- a number on her arm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Do you know what it was? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  I have it written down somewhere, but I -- I don’t remember it offhand. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It’s -- it’s interesting, my mother never wanted me to photograph the number, and she -- she talked many times of having it removed, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">She always kept it covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She was -- til the end of her life she would shop for dresses that had, you know, sleeves that just barely covered the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">She -- she did not want to show that number. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Eventually my mother ended up at a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at the German-Danish border, and that’s where she eventually was -- was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">It was actually about a month or two before the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It turns out, and this -- this was really found out -- and my mother did tell me that she was liberated, came off a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , was in -- 1n <span class="REGION">territory</span> that was marked, Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And she was greeted by a Count Bernadotte o-of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I believe the Danish -- Swedish crown prince was with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And she was, it turned out, part of a large convoy of -- of women who had been kept hostage by Himmler to try to gain his own freedom, eventually, negotiate his own safety after the war through -- wi-with -- with Count Folke Bernadotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And also she was fortunate enough to be -- to be saved as a result of that, and to be liberated.</span></p>

QUESTION:  -- was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbritick</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  I think 1t was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">She did mention that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There were other -- several small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that my mother was -- was with -- was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And that’s -- that’s -- that was the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then from -- from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , she was transferred. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Now, she never mentioned the white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , the famous white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> specifically, but subsequently I’ve seen photographs of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I’ve never been able to verify with her whether that’s how she was transported, but she did tell me that she crossed <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , which was then still occupied, and was taken in by a family in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The inmates were just -- were distributed to -- to different families in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> who were willing to take in the prisoners and be part of the rehabilitation process, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And she remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> through the end of the war until August 1945, when she returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  All right, well now let’s -- that helps us get back to your story, which was that you were then placed across the <span class="DLF">street</span> with Annie Madna.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  We also need to talk about my sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah, I meant your -- your -- your story and your sister’s story. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Yeah, okay, so you’re at Annie Madna’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and your sisters are with this Catholic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I don’t know exactly the name of the family that -- that my sisters were placed with. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Much, much later I found a book that -- that contained an advertisement asking for the whereabouts of my sisters, and the name they were given was Jonson, the last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And I don’t know whether that’s the name of the family that they were hidden with or not, my mother didn’t tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But in any event, I-I was placed with -- with Annie Madna --
QUESTION:  But before we get to that, who placed that advertisement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  This was an advertisement placed in a Jewish newspaper in July 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  By whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  We don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We don’t know who placed the advertisement. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I gave a talk about my family’s experiences and someone in the audience worked at the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , and the following day just happened to pick up a book that contained reprints from Jewish newspapers in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and there, in the middle of the page was an adver -- was an advertisement a-asking about -- the whereabouts of my two sisters and where they had last been seen when they were deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  But no n -- knowledge of who placed it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  There was a -- the -- the name, actually was th -- was -- there was a name in there in terms of contact and it was Van Luhrmann family. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So I think that this was August 4, 2002 a different member of the same family, the Van Luhrmann family, because they were not -- this was not The Hague address.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">All right, now let’s get back to th -- yo-your story and their story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  I was placed with Annie Madna and again with -- with the -- the -- with the goal of eventually going to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I remained with Annie for -- I don’t know exactly how long, I think about two months altogether, because I -- I think I was told that I was 11 months old when I finally arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">Tolé Madna household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Tolé Madna was the ex-husband of Annie Madna. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They had joint custody of their three children, Vidy -- Willy, Davy and Robby. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And so I was transferred to -- eventually to -- to her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Tolé Madna had a housekeeper by the name of Mima Saina, S-a-i-n-a. We don’t even know what -- what -- what her real name was, if that was her real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">She was an Indonesian woman who was really -- the Indonesian term was a babu, which was nursemaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">She took care of -- or nanny. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And she took care of the children and also the entire <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">She was a -- a young woman, probably in her 20’s at the time and had no -- was not married and had no children of her own, but she had taken care of -- especially o-of -- of Robby Madna when he was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And -- so it was completely natural for her to -- to take me on as -- as -- and take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And she really did not want to part with me, and apparently the other children in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> also liked the idea of having August 4, 2002 a baby in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and so I ended up remaining with the Madna family until the return of my mother in August 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Obviously, since I was an infant I have, you know, very few memories, direct memories just of -- of my stay with the Madna family, but I do have a few, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I -- I remember listening to Indonesian lullabies that Papa Madna, Mr. Tolé Madna played on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Can you sing any of them now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  No, I can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">My native tongue apparently was -- was Malay, or Indonesian, but I’ve totally -- I’ve just almost totally forgotten it, for two -- a few words, but I was told that that’s how I communicated with Mima, who did not speak any Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">She was actually illiterate, couldn’t read or write.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  When you were gr -- not you, but when your family, in the 1930’s and your sisters were talking to each other, it was in Dutch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">My family, th-they all spoke Dutch, and my mother had learned Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Close -- it’s close enough to German that -- that she learned Dutch fairly quickly, that’s what my father spoke, and certainly, you know -- they tried everything really to -- to -- to become a part of the -- the Dutch community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that I was hidden in was located -- was not -- van Kinsbergenstraat, number 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And it was a -- a -- a very modest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in -- not too far from the -- the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of my parents and also my -- my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was actually an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was just a <span class="DLF">door</span> away from where my mothe -- my father’s business was, his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And this was probably half a mile, or a mile away from-om where the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was, certainly within walking distance, was where the <span class="BUILDING">van Kinsbergenstraat house</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It had a <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> , sort of a <span class="INT_SPACE">middle room</span> , typical <span class="BUILDING">Dutch house</span> and then a <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> and then two little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> at the very, very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I slept in sort of an enclosed porch, as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">My father -- my foster father, Papa Madna also had kept birds, that was his hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">He had canaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And that was one of the other sounds, besides the -- the -- the lullabies, the Indonesian lullaby, what I also remember was the sound of canaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I’ve subsequently made a tape of that, actually, because it -- that’s -- it’s something that he -- he stuck to through the end of his life, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">He had a tremendous love for his birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It was a very joyful <span class="BUILDING">household</span> as I -- as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I -- I do remember one specific thing, which must have been when I was a little bit older, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I came there when I was less than a year old, my guess is when I was about two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I - August 4, 2002 I tried to copy the writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I saw my -- the -- my foster -- my sisters, then sisters, Willy and Davy tri -- writing and so I scribbled on a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I remember that they were laughing and I was very unhappy about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It’s -- 1t’s just one of those memories that -- that has stuck with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I -- I also remember some of the f -- a little bit of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Here in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> I have -- I have some items actually that were in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There was a big, Indonesian wayang doll, which is a puppet, which is now hanging in my <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And just to show, you know, the dimensions of -- of -- perceived dimensions as a child, Papa Madna had a -- a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liquor cabinet</span> that was shaped like a barrel, and to me it looked very big, actually and it wasn’t until many, many years later, recently in fact, that I encountered that barrel again and realized that it was very tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I -- I -- that barrel is now in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as well, I -- it -- 1t arrived here rece -- just a few weeks ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And just -- just one other reminder of those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I also remember some of the toys I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I had a big yellow stuffed dog and then a little stuffed rabbit, also yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I subsequently found out that that’s where much of my mother’s jewelry was actually hidden, was sewn into -- to th -- my toy rabbit. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I also, towards the -- remember one particular time when I was hungry and the last winter of the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was extremely bad, very rough, and there was really very, very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And the only thing we had to eat at that time -- again something I found out August 4, 2002 subsequently, is tulip bulbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I remember waking up, or -- one night and feeling hungry and seeing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> set for the following morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And so I just sat down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , waiting to be fed, and I -- I -- I really distinctly remember falling asleep and my head falling into the plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">That’s one very distinct memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And then the -- the most definite memory I have is when my mother returned, when I was reunited with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  We'll -- we’ll get to that in a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Let’s talk a little bit about your experience before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Did you go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> at all, or were you confined in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Oh no, I -- I was confined to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , basically, and I do -- my view of the outside world was really through a <span class="DLF">mail slot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That’s the only thing that I saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  So you never went out the <span class="DLF">front door</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  I never went out the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , never went out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but was allowed to play in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , and I have some photographs of me playing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Very --
QUESTION:  But you -- you could be seen in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Some of the neighbors were aware of the fact of my -- were aware of my presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">My -- Papa Madna told me that in fact he had made a -- concocted a story that I was the illegitimate child of his ex-wife, who now had a new boyfriend who August 4, 2002 didn’t want me around, and that’s how I ended up in his <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Whether, you know, he really used this story with the Germans or not, I don’t know, but that’s the story he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The n -- our neighbors on va -- on <span class="DLF">van Kinsbergenstraat</span> , I was told were actually very anti-German, were communist and so they were of the where -- aware of the fact that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Many members of the Indonesian community who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I think also were aware of the fact that I was there in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and -- and in fact, many, many years later, when I would visit Papa Madna, we -- we -- we’d go to a <span class="BUILDING">Indonesian grocer store</span> and the grocer had one look at the combination of Papa Madna and myself and immediately realized who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And he called me by my then name, I had a name in hiding called -- I was called Bobby, and that’s what he called me, you know, Bobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I -- I -- I thought for many years that I -- | was named after the dog, I had -- there was a dog in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And that the reason for that 1s so that people would think the dog was being called when I was being called, and -- as a -- as a disguise. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That story turned out not to be true, because I found out that the dog’s name was actually Teddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with the other children in the family that you were told either later or that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Well, to this day, I am still their younger sibling. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It’s -- it’s -- you know, that -- it’s -- it’s very, very interesting actually, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">For example, September 11" August 4, 2002 last year, the first telephone call that I got to make sure I was safe was from one of the siblings, was from Davy Madna. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">She -- she called me here several times, left messages on the machine, was desperate to find out, to make sure that I was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And whenever -- and I’ve maintained contact over the years and there is no question but that when I’m with them, I always feel the younger sibling. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Mr. Madna subsequently remarried and three more children and there is no question but that I feel like the older sibling to the next three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So I’m really the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">In fact, the only time that they ever talk to each other is when I’m there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  When the two sets --
ANSWER:  The two sets of children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And when you were talking about September 11", that was 2001.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the elder Mr. Madna, what you know about his background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Mr. T-Tolé Madna was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> and came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> around -- he was born in 1896 and came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> around the time of World War II -- World War I, sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">With either -- and I’m not sure whether this was his mother or a foster mother, I’m not sure, he was very, very mysterious about his background, never August 4, 2002 talked about it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Apparently he came from a family that was relatively well-to-do, because he -- he -- after he arrived at <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> he was able to take piano lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He was very proud of the fact that he owned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , and he -- he really became a part of -- of the very -- the young Indonesian community that was being established in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384"><span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , of course, was a <span class="REGION">Dutch colony</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And he -- he then married Annie Madna, further really integrating him really into - into Dutch society. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But he also, I think felt very proud of his -- of his Indonesian heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">He -- there were paintings in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that illustrated, really, life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Indonesian villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And he -- he enjoyed gardening in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">van Kinsbergenstraat</span> actually, we kept chickens in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , which he -- he really greatly enjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Many years later, when he moved to a smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> after the war, he -- he got one of those little <span class="DLF">gardens</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and th-there was no question as t -- his <span class="DLF">garden</span> , his little <span class="DLF">garden</span> was the most luxuriant of any of them around. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And -- and he had all sorts of -- of little quirks. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">For example, he -- he dug a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , which became a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Was very, very clever, that’s where he kept his beer, so that when he worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> he could sit there and -- this little <span class="DLF">yard</span> , little <span class="DLF">garden</span> , he had his -- his -- his little comforts from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">End of Tape One, Side B August 4, 2002 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">This is tape number two, side A. And you were talking about Papa Madna. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Any other memories that you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="396">What -- was he a very affectionate, physically affectionate person? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Do you remember any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  He was a very affectionate, very warm person. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I’m not sure about physical affection, but you know, we -- we were very, very, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">He was always to -- to the very end very protective of me, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I remember sitting on his lap. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I remember also, this was immediately after the war when I was allowed to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I remember sitting on the back of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , or he also had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> on the front of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> where I would sit, and I enjoyed that a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We would take long walks together. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He -- the -- we’d alway -- he would always -- this was after the war, immediately after the war an-and he worked in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and I would go up the <span class="DLF">back stairs</span> with him and the Indonesian women who worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> would always have little snacks for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">He -- he always as -- as -- even when it was really no longer necessary he would always have a -- a little savings, a piggy bank for me, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He fashioned those out of his cigarette boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">These were Player cigarettes, which came in metal cans at the time, and I August 4, 2002 remember he made those into a <span class="BUILDING">piggy bank</span> for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And that continued for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He bought me comic books, because he knew there was one comic strip that I really enjoyed called “Panda” which was really just only found in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and he would always buy me the little books, and I -- I really enjoyed those. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So we - we really had a very, very close relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And that -- that continued to the very end of his life when he died at age 96. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I-I saw him just two months before he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Joel and I went to vi -- went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we visited him, spent quite a bit of time with him and with his t -- other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And I -- I remember his final gesture- first of all, his final words to me was to -- to be careful, and watch over my mother, which was very typical. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">This is the way he had always been, very concerned about her as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And then, as we were leaving the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> he stood at the <span class="DLF">window</span> waving a white handkerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And that was the last gesture, that was the last time I saw him alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And then two months later I went back for the funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And people say that he kept himself alive waiting for me to come and visit him one last time because he -- he and I were very, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I also to -- to the very end always called him Papa. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">There were no qualifications to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now, Mima we have not talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Obviously, the person who really raised me, especially when I was very young, when I was an infant, was Mima. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I was told that I slept in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , slept with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And I was also told that Mima kept a knife under August 4, 2002 her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> and that she said that if ever the Germans came for me, she would kill me and then herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Again, I have no direct knowledge of that, but that’s what I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I was very, very close to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I have absolutely no direct memory of -- of Mima, except perhaps the few words of -- of -- of Malay Indonesian that I remember, but other than that, I have no direct memory while she was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Mima tragically died shortly after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">She died in October 1945 of a cerebral hemorrhage, very, very unexpectedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I do remember visiting her <span class="DLF">grave</span> many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I also remember going back there to -- to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> when Papa Madna buried his favorite canary in -- in the same <span class="DLF">grave</span> , the <span class="DLF">gravesite</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And many, many years later I went to visit the <span class="DLF">grave</span> with Papa Madna. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And th-there -- there was a woman at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , who again, because of the combination of an Indonesian man and a Caucasian young man -- younger man, immediately knew who I was and recognized me from the little child who had come to visit the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mima</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I was able to find the <span class="DLF">grave</span> without anybody telling me where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So there was a very sharp divide, I just totally bla -- have -- have totally -- have no direct memory of her alive, but I do remember her <span class="DLF">grave</span> very well, very distinctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Were there any times when it was very dangerous? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Did any Germans come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Was there any particular incidents like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="440">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  I have no direct memories of any particular dangerous times, but I do remember being asked to hide in this -- it’s not -- a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Was a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , I thought it was beneath the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , but I’m not quite sure there were <span class="DLF">stairs</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and th-that’s where all the families -- the families’ Christmas decorations were -- were -- were actually kept, and I -- I remember playing with them while the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> apparently was being searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Another memory that I have of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> besi- | mentioned the little barrel before -- my very favorite <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was actually the kneehole of Papa Madna’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">It was sort of a dark mahogany <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I -- I still very distinctly remember that kneehole. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I also remember opening one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawers</span> one time and finding a gun and then closing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I- | didn’t tell anybody about it at the time, but told Papa Madna about it many, many years later and he was absolutely shocked that I had seen it and remembered it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So what did -- what were you told that you did during the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="449">You just played with Mima, and -- the other children were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  I think I just -- I -- I really -- I -- I don’t know, specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I did play with some of the children next door, there were other young children, and I have some photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  But only in your <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  On -- only in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And I -- I did have my toys, and I did look out the <span class="DLF">mail slot</span> to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but just was confined to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But I -- I really do not recall anything sp-specific as to what -- what I did in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> during those years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of what it was like to look through the <span class="DLF">mail slot</span> to see the outside world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  Not really, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I-I remember doing it, and standing there and evy -- and even the mail sl -- even though the <span class="DLF">mail slot</span> was very low, to me it seemed very high, I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">You know, <span class="DLF">van Kinsbergenstraat</span> was actually a very quiet <span class="DLF">street</span> , there wasn’t much going on, even there. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And so I think I spent more time, really, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> than anywhere else, which was enclosed, so that people really couldn’t look in very easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  And these two people were your parents at the time, Mima and -- and Mr. Madna were your mama and your papa.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And that was, you know, became very difficult, of course, when I was reunited with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  While this was -- while you were at the Madna’s, what was happening with your two sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  Unfortunately there was -- a fight apparently had broken out between the husband and wife of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where my sisters were hidden, and the husband August 4, 2002 denounced of his wife and of my two sisters to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And so his wife and my two sisters were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and were actually there at about the same time as my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Either there, or subsequently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> [indecipherable] obviously they never saw each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The woman, the wife eventually was liberated, but my sisters were deported from -- taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> in 1944, early 1944 to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they both died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And it’s na -- something that we did not -- my mother did not find out until she returned, actually, back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I’m not sure whether my mother had had any warning when she was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I -- I just -- we never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I really don’t know exactly when she found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I don’t think she found out until she actually returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , what had happened to my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">My mother was so upset at the time, obviously, that she -- she squeezed -- she developed this habit of squeezing her fi -- her hand with -- with her other hand, one hand with the other and she actually developed an infection in her fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It was -- you know, she squeezed so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I remember very distinctly the time when I was reunited with my mother, finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">This was in -- in August 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Well, let’s back up a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  -- flow together. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I do remember leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I-I’m told I was all dressed up in -- in the national colors of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and watching a parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It’s interesting because I don’t have any direct memory of that, but I do have a memory of about eight months later or so, being with my mother at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we watched the parade and telling her that’s where I was with Mima. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">That memory I do have, which 1s -- which 1s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And -- and my mother really didn’t believe me at the time, and she had to -- she verified this with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But other than that, I really don’t have any -- any specific memories of -- of the months before my mother returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">When I was -- I -- I was sleeping the night she came back and someone came to wake me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I don’t know who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I think it was one of my sisters, foster sisters, Davy or Willy. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where everybody was sitting in a circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And I was crying because I was unhappy about being woken up, and I was being passed around from lap to lap. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I do August 4, 2002 remember very distinctly refusing to sit in a strange woman’s lap, and that, of course, was my own mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And it took awhile for my mother to -- for me to get used to my mother, and to be -- I -- I have no specific memories of all the things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">One thing my mother told me was that she as -- she told Mima -- she- she got tickets for Mima to go to a movie, which was something very special at that time, and just so -- so that my mother would have some time alone with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And Mima left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then came back a few minutes later and told my mother, don’t hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Just -- that’s how protective, of course, Mima was, even vis- a-vis with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Initially my mother and I stayed with the Madna family and then my mother found an apar -- was a very small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Well, these were furnished rooms, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Again, somewhere not far from where our original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had been on Laanformairdafort, another -- sort of all in the same general <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> upstairs and a woman and her daughter lived there and they -- they rented out the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I do remember that they had a little dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">You know, it’s funny what children remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Little dachshund.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  How long did -- did your mother stay at the Madna’s? </span><span class="sentence" id="509">She stayed with you at the <span class="BUILDING">Madna’s</span> for how long? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  I think 1t was a few weeks, I’m not sure entirely, cause then we moved with -- to this first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I think we were only there for a month or two and then moved to a larger <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  D-Do you have any memories of leaving the <span class="BUILDING">Madna house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  You know, I think that this -- I -- I don’t, and I think part of that is because it was a very gradual thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I still spent a lot of time with them --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  -- initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  I mean, you were -- you were only -- close to four years old, you were still a very young child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  I think it’s really only probably after Mima died that I moved entirely with, or primarily with -- with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And she -- sh -- she had to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to try to make a living, and the reason I say that I -- I -- I was really away from the Madna family at that point, because I remember one time having trouble getting into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that was because my mother was away, she was actually selling some of the merchandise that my father had left behind from his <span class="BUILDING">tailoring business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Fabrics were very valuable at the time and he had many <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> that owed him fabrics from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And that’s -- that was her first business, was Selling those. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  Who kept up his stock while he was taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">This was not in his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> any more, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was -- was gone, had been taken over. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So these -- this was really more a credit sort of -- and my mother, actually, her initial work was out of a suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But then I remember the day when -- when I couldn’t get into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she was extremely upset and that’s when she decided to -- to start her own business, basically and she bought us a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But this was over a fairly long period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I would imagine -- I think she bought the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> probably about 1947 or so. ’'</span><span class="sentence" id="527">m not entirely sure because I had already gone to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> at a -- at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was around the corner from that second <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that we lived in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  Was that a hard adjustment, to leave, to go to a strange <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  [love difficulties mixing with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don’t remember too much to -- having too many difficulties at the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , actually, but I do remember my mother sending me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And that -- that created tre-tremendous difficulties and fears.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wijk aan Zee</span> , not too far from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and I was surrounded by very, very rowdy Jewish kids who had all been in hiding and who all had, in retrospect, tremendous difficulties, you know, they were very August 4, 2002 difficult to control. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And I had come from at -- you know, very quiet <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I had had it easy compared to -- to many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I was -- so I -- I just did not fit in, and I had trouble, you know, wi-with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So then the next <span class="NPIP">place</span> that my mother sent me to for summer vacation was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> , but it was actually a private <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I went with m -- friends of my mother in a -- ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appledorn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And th-that’s -- that worked out much, much better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  Y-You have actual memories of th -- of those experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  Of being with those children who were rowdy, and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Very much so, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I remember vomiting every day and really being sick and then finally my mother, you know, take me -- took me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I -- I did not last one we -- I think I lasted about a week and then she took me back, and -- because it d -- it just did not work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  How was your proficiency in Dutch? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Were you -- you said you -- you knew Indonesian at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Were -- were you also being brought up as a youngster to speak Dutch when you were with the Madnas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  I don’t remember ever having any difficulties when I was in -- when I started <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> or <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so I think I -- I -- I think I was pretty fluent in Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">As I said, I d -- I never -- I don’t remember ever speaking Malay, so this was really very, August 4, 2002 very early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It’s only in speaking to Robby and Davy that I -- you know, that I was told that I -- I really did communicate and answered in -- in Malay whenever I was spoken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And I was able to understand Mima. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But -- but I must have, you know, learned Dutch at that time as well from the other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  Did you ask your mother about the rest of the family? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Again, I know you were very young at this time, but when you were -- in the beginning, those first few years after the war, did you ask her? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And if so, how did she answer you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  I learned about my sisters and -- and about my -- my father very, very early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The interesting thing is, you know, that at that time my story was not unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So having sisters who were deported was not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And so it didn’t particularly shock me, it didn’t particularly affect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They were just gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And my mother -- my mother’s neighbor, the Van Luhrmann family, they were both schoolteachers and they had taught my sisters how to -- to read and write at a very, very young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And they and my mother had saved all of my sisters’ notebooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And my mother would show me those notebooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And this -- this was before I started <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , so it was really pretty soon after the war that she showed me those. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">She had portraits of my sisters that were -- that were hanging 1n -- in the -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So again I knew certainly, of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">She told me many stories about my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They were held out, really as a example to me in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And so I got to know my August 4, 2002 sisters through my mother’s words and also through her neighbors, the Van Luhrmann family. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They v -- also showed me -- my mother showed me the notebooks that -- that my sister Eva was writing in. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I don’t think my sister Leah was -- she was much younger, obviously did not know how to -- to write, but the Van Luhrmann family also showed me books, and they were actually -- because, as I said before, my sisters had gone to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic religious school</span> , so she would show me books, little Catholic books that my sisters were able to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And I remember had a little devil one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , a little angel on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And I -- I remember very distinctly looking at those. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">My mother always told me that she -- she had decided that she did not want me to learn how to read at a very young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">She thought somehow that this was a jinx. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That when -- when, you know, my sisters were So precocious in their reading and writing, that somehow had something to do with -- with their -- with their fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And so in my case, my mother really did not encourage that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Who watched over your parent’s belongings while you were gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">You said your mother had pictures of your sister, or portraits, or other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Who -- who oversaw that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  The Van Luhrmann family next door had some of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">There were others also who -- who had hidden things, and we sort of gradually -- my mother gradually August 4, 2002 had things returned to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Again, you know, this -- this was sort of part of normal life, to have things returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">All the people we had contact with after the war were people who were -- either had survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or people who had been in hiding, so that was normal conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You know, it was how you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">How did you survive, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="587">It’s without -- with very little emotion, as far as I can remember, actually, because it was so much -- just an everyday occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  The same thing, for example, one of the families that we were very close with after the war was the Vanderpool family. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Hela Vanderpool was a woman who had gone through all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And she was younger than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Also came from the same general area in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And after the war married a -- a Dutch man. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Her -- her maiden name was Helen -- Helen Enwine and then she married Max Vanderpool. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And my mother remained very close friends with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Probably -- she was probably my mother’s closest friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And the only housing that they could find in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was sort of left standing 1n this entire bombed out neighborhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And I remember this is a time my mother already had her <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , taking this very, very long walk across this bombed out area, this -- this -- all this debris and rubble, through August 4, 2002 the rubble to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they lived, this <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And again, it was -- 1t was a joyful occasion to take those walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I thought it was the most normal thing to do, was to take a walk across, you know, bombed out rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I remember thinking that it was the most normal thing to find <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> with shells on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Again, this was just part of normal growing up after World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">This is tape number two, side B. And let’s now talk about your schooling after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Well, before I even started schooling, my mother, who as I said before, did not really want me to learn how to read or write before had to teach me some other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And that was the first thing she taught me, was really a love for -- for <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , and for <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> type games, and I remember very distinctly playing those. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She would tell me things that -- plays that she had done when she was a young girl, young -- growing up 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , she was part of a -- a theater company. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And I would remember those, and that’s -- and I would -- I would actually start playing those before I even learned how to read or write, with a <span class="BUILDING">puppet theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That became one of my favorite toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Another thing that really fascinated me, probably because I August 4, 2002 had spent those early years completely confined to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> on -- on public -- this public conveyance, on the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And I very quickly memorized all of the stops on the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> , the <span class="DLF">local tramway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And one of the first toys that I got from Papa Madna after the war for my -- the first birthday that occurred after the war was a miniature <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And right about that time the numbers, in sort of a bureaucratic thing, were -- were changed on the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And I remember, since I didn’t know how to read or write yet, but I did remember asking either Willy or Davy to make sure and change the number on my <span class="DLF">tramway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It’s a very, very distinct memory I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">This was just about the time when I started <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> was right around the corner from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that my mother and I lived in, which was on a place called Archimaidastraat [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">street</span> -- straat in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> and right around the corner was the first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I do remember very distinctly enjoying <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , doing all the things pe -- children do in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , you know, making things wi -- c -- playing with clay, remember that very distinctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Little artwork, bringing that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , learning about some -- some holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">For example, I -- I learned about Mother’s day through <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and bringing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a card that I had made for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I also remember going shopping to buy my mother a gift, and 1t was a geranium. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That was the first plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I August 4, 2002 went to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and asked her, you know, if she has this much money, whatever it was, I said, what would she get? </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And so that’s -- that was the first time I ever bought a gift for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I think for her birthday, which was very close actually, since that was May 20" -- the two were very close -- I bought her a bottle of perfume which I accidentally dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Also one of those -- those childhood memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I kept it hidden from her in back of -- and so I was holding it in back of me, and phew, it fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> as th -- as she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">After -- 1t was after <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> that -- just about that time that my mother bought her business. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">That was in a -- that was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">cosmetic store</span> , <span class="BUILDING">perfume store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">It was in the --in -- not ina very good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , quite far away from where we had lived before and where I had spent my years with the Madnas. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">This was near the -- one the <span class="BUILDING">train stations</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Little bit of a red light district, as a matter of fact, and certainly non -- not a wealthy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , but it was the only -- housing was extremely short in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because o f-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> especially, because such a big part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had been bombed out by the allies, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And so we -- she found this -- this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , this <span class="BUILDING">perfume store</span> from a man who -- it was called <span class="BUILDING">Parfumerie Idajale</span> , and she bought it from a man by the name of Sharfstein who moved to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And she took over the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and we lived in back of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then I -- she -- she had to decided on a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me to go to -- decided that the -- the public August 4, 2002 <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were just not the greatest in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">There was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us, but for whatever reason, my mother did not want to go that route -- route again, because probably it brought back too many memories of my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So instead, I went to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">private Protestant school</span> called the Weeshuis, it was called Weeshuis, it means <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I don’t know whether there -- there ever was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> attached to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at one point, but that was what it was called, the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Which was a fair distance from -- from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but not -- not too great and I -- I was able to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by myself, and I went there for my -- for the first few grades, first two grades.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Was that a pleasant experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Did you find a better adjustment with the other children then you did in the summer experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  Oh definitely, I -- I did very well in -- in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , I did very well in -- I did very well in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and I did very well, I had no trouble whatsoever in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in terms of fact, you know, I sort of became a leader among ah, the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I had no trouble making friends at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">There was an incident with -- with a schoolteacher who sang a song that had some inappropriate words in it and I told my mother about it, and --
QUESTION:  You mean anti-Semitic? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  No, no, not anti-Semitic, just sexual. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And he made some gestures that were inappropriate and I told my mother about it, and I -- you know, the teacher and the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , with whom we were very good friends, my mother had become close friends with the fre -- with the principal and I was very close friends with the principal’s son. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">His name was Bati Bos, B-o-s. And they came over to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was confronted, I was asked to -- to confront the teacher and tell them what -- what had happened, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And after that my mother decided to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I then went on, took a <span class="DLF">tramway</span> actually to go back to take -- to -- to attend the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we had lived before the war, because my mother really felt those were the better <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And that was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And that’s where I went for third and fourth grades [indecipherable] something approximately, and I again, you know, enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And then subsequently then, after that, is when we -- when we moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And so I attended <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in - in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , if I remember correctly, probably 1952 -- either 19 -- some time between 1950 and 1952 1s when we moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And my mother at that point, at the -- was considering or attempting a remarriage that -- that utterly failed, but we did end up living in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> for several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  Was that hard for you, to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Madnas</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  It was difficult to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Madnas</span> and by then also I had become very close with -- with other friends of my mother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">For example, one family that we’re v -- we were very, very close with was a family that lived -- called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbergan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Husband was Truus, T-r-u-u-s, and Piet, P-i-e-t. They -- my -- my Uncle Emil, whom I mentioned earlier, had actually been hidden with them in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijnsburg</span> , outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leiden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And -- but he was -- he was found out by the Germans and was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And I never really found out anything else about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I have no new information whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But we became very close friends with the Ravensbergan family and we would spend many weekends traveling there. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">We would take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leiden</span> and then a second, more local tramway, actually [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">tramway</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of -- of -- of -- where they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I -- I would spend weekends there, or sometimes a week and I would ver -- I was very, very close with those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">By that time the Vanderpool family had left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They emigrated du -- in 1948 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so that was a loss for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And that’s, I think, when she became really very -- even closer friends with -- with these -- the Ravensbergan in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijnsburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And we would go there almost every other weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And -- and leaving them when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I remember catching rides August 4, 2002 periodically to get back to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijnsburg</span> is a -- is an <span class="REGION">area</span> where it’s in the middle of all the <span class="DLF">flower fields</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the flower industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with flowers would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to deliver them to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And when these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would go back empty I would catch a ride with them to go back and visit the family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So I remained in very close contact with them as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  Was your mother extremely protective of you when you were young, after the war because of what you went through? </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Did -- did you sense that maybe more than other parents of your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">It’s hard to say, you know, because it’s -- it’s compared to what, you know, I have no -- I have no way of comparing. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I-I don’t f -- you know, I -- when I was in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> I became -- I had -- I became very, very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I had a ruptured appendix. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And this was in my first year in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , if I remember correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And at that -- at that time there was no -- there were no antibiotics, as yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Penicillin had just come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So I was really very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for about 10 weeks altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And my mother had a tremendous fear that she was going to lose me at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And she talked about that, a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And that’s -- that’s when I really found out how much I meant to her, that -- that -- you August 4, 2002 know. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I was the one thing that kept her going, and she told me that many, many, many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So yes, you know, she was very protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But at the same time, for example, did allow me to play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , did allow me to have friends, encouraged me to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by myself, even though there was some danger there. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And one time I was almost hit by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But nonetheless, sh-she did allow me that freedom and she allowed me to grow up, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So she was not overly protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">She also tried to encourage me to mix with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Hence, you know, the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I went to -- I would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant elementary school</span> in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> , to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> which was in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> adjacent to the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And that was a very, very long walk actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But I [indecipherable] my mother never accompanied me. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">She couldn’t, she had her <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And she certainly allowed me to go there by myself, and I -- I do remember attending the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I remember also her warning, because I was -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> was extremely good at teaching Bible, and so she -- she told -- and I was very good at that, so she told me, don’t repeat in the afternoon, what you learned in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  Did you feel very Jewish then, when you were that young? </span><span class="sentence" id="706">You really knew you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  I definitely knew that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I -- certainly my mother made -- you know, sent me to the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> very, very early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I think at the same time, virtually that I started <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , I started going to the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> , which wasn’t much of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the time because there were very, very few kids left. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">My teacher was the cantor of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , Mr. Mussel, and I -- I don’t remember too much of what we -- what he ler -- what he taught us, but I -- and shortly -- it was around that time also, when my mother definitely found out that my father had died, when we got documentation through the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">My mother had a very good friend who worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Liza. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And he managed to speed things up so that we got documents from the Red Cross explaining exactly what had happened to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And as soon as we found out when he had died exactly, we - my mother di -- encouraged me to learn to say Kaddish and to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on his Yahrzeit. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And I probably was about six or seven when I started doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And I also remember going, certainly, to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Rosh Hashanah, on Yom Kippur with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I remember very distinctly, for example -- you know, that - this was an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> and so the women sat in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gallery</span> upstairs and of course, there I was all by myself downstairs, and I had to be adopted by some -- some of the men downstairs, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And I remember for the first time th-the honor of rolling up the -- the scroll, the Torah scroll is usually given to a August 4, 2002 child in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I remember being given the honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And then afterwards, you know, going over and shaking the hand of the president of the congregation, or the parness, as we called him there, and then rushing upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> to ask my mother if I had done okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Did she observe the Sabbath at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  Yes, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">She -- she certainly lit candles on Friday night and she observed Pesach, very distinctly I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">The Pesach I remember most distinctly was in- in 1948, and the reason I remember it is because my mother was telling me the story about the Egyptians, and then at the same time there was the Arab Israeli war. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I remember asking how -- her how this was possible since all the Egyptians had already been defeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So that was -- that was -- I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I remember, you know, going out and buying matzos, which were hard to get in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They were round and came in special boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The other thing was that -- that I remember in terms of -- of -- of Jewish things is that I had -- a-as I indicated before, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> , and either the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or someone passed out -- passed my name on to a -- a pastor, a p -- a Protestant pastor who was a Jewish convert, by the name of Suril Tabachsblaat. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And he came to my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with the idea, I think, of trying to convert her to becoming Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But by the time he left the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , she had sent him on errands in August 4, 2002 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , she knew he was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and so he brought back mezuzahs and a siddur, which we didn’t have, you know, none of that was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And to this day the mezuzah on my <span class="DLF">door</span> is the mezuzah that Mr. Tabachsblaat brought back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">She also persuaded him to let her -- and I don’t think it took much - she told him, she said we were going to have a Seder and she said, you know, Seder is not necessarily a Jewish thing, why don’t you have a Seder in your <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And she -- she persuaded him, something that became very commonplace afterwards, to have a Seder in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And my mother spoke to his congregants about the Jewish lifecycle events. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And my mother, in many ways, I think, rediscovered Judaism after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Her experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> did not seem to lessen her faith, but if anything increased it, and she became much more interested in Judaism after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Before the war she -- she used the word, searching. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">After the war there was no searching any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  When you were at this <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> , where there other J-Jewish children there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  No, there were no other Jewish children at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span> , I wa -- as far as I know, I was the only one there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  Were you accepted by the other children? </span><span class="sentence" id="742">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I -- I don’t think there was a -- as I said, you know, I was very close friends, for example, with the -- the son of the principal. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">The principal’s wife was also one of the schoolteachers and I -- I remember watching her grading papers and things like that and spending a lot of time in their <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and I had many other children in the <span class="DLF">playground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And I had no difficulty, you know, playing games with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I remember our favorite game -- my favorite game at that time, because I enjoyed going to -- Papa Madna had taken me to the circus and my mother took me to the <span class="BUILDING">circus</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , which is really a big deal over there, and I remember playing circus in -- in the <span class="DLF">playground</span> with the other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  Then, did your mother talk about your father and the children as you got older -- your sisters, as they -- got older, was it a big topic of conversation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Well, as I said before, my mother showed me my sister’s notebooks and through the Van Luhrmann family I also -- you know, we constantly talked about my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Maybe a little bit less so about my father except my mother did tell me about the -- his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and what it looked like and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> they had bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">In many ways he was really kept, you know, in the family and very early on she gave me a -- apen, a Parker pen that belonged to him, which I have -- which I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That sort of became a good luck charm. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Whenever I took an exam or anything, she told me to take the pen along and use that pen for writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So she -- she -- she really August 4, 2002 tried, you know, to impress on me who my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Said things like, you know, your father is with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And when -- whenever, you know, there were moments of difficulty, or -- or sadness, or po-potential difficulties, we -- I do remember fairly early on after the war, visiting the woman who had hidden my sisters, where my sisters had been hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">She and her husband, as far as I know, separated, so he was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">But my mother took me in to what -- t-to what me seemed -- seemed like a very long trip actually on the <span class="DLF">tramway</span> , way outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , somewhere near the <span class="DLF">beach</span> is where this woman lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And it was very important to my mother to thank this woman and let her know that at least one of the children had survived and to relieve some of this woman’s guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And my mother gave her some -- some money, some gifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I don’t know whether my mother had any subsequent contact with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">That must obviously have been an incredibly difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">We also had continued contact with the two priests, one of them I mentioned before, Father Schulling, the other one was called Father Lodders, L-o-d-d-e-r-s, and he was -- oh, he was much younger though, Schulling was the older man and Lodders was a- a younger, Jesuit priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And he would come to visit my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> quite frequently on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And I -- I very much remember him also. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And in some ways they -- they also encouraged me in Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Not too many forms, actually, the- you know, is -- I was at my -- my mother took great pride in exposing me in an ha August 4, 2002- to -- to many different beliefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It was very important to her, which is really amazing after what she went through, to -- to have a respect and an understanding of other religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And she would take great pride, for example, at birthday parties for me, in counting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> how many different religions she had represented. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And there were always very devout Catholics, there were the Madnas, who were probably Moslem in origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">There were the Protestant family from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijnsburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And you have to understand that in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , Protestants and Catholics do not speak to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But there they were, all around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And then there were Jewish members, and some of them were very Orthodox Jewish, and my mother took tremendous pride in bringing -- and in the convert Minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And my mother took tremendous pride in bringing all these people around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">This was very, very important to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  You had mentioned that when you went to visit the woman who sheltered your sisters, your mother wanted to give her some gifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Had j -- had your folks given any money to the Madnas to take care of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t give any money, as far as I know, to the Madnas, or they had th- in other words, there was no money paid for my -- for -- for -- for them sheltering me. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">They did give them some ration cards and ration coupons so that they could obtain food for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">There may have been some money, you know, to -- to -- to help August 4, 2002 take care of me, defray expenses, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But they certainly weren’t paid, you know, to take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">There was no -- no -- no, there was no monetary gain to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  And what about the family that took your sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  I think it was the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">No, it was really -- my sisters, th -- all their possessions were taken to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And again, the most important thing at that time was ration cards, and I remember what they looked like, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I remember immediately after the war even, you know, when rationing continued, going with my mother to get those ration cards at an -- at an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and standing on <span class="DLF">line</span> to get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So I was -- I was very familiar with those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  And then you also mentioned the probab -- possibly the Moslem background of the Madnas. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Were there any holidays or any traditions that you -- that they carried out while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Christmas was the only holiday because I remember the decorations. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They had a Christmas tree and it was decorated. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">There were no electric lights, but I remember there were real candles in the -- in -- in the Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I’m not entirely sure whether there was one during the war years, or whether the one that I remember was immediately after. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I th -- it may have been immediately after when my mother was actually in -- I just remembered that now, is when my mother was actually August 4, 2002 living there with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">She was there at the time, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So this may -- this -- this may have been the first Christmas, 1945, but I’m not --
QUESTION:  I -- I -- I thought you said she stayed a few weeks with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Or whether she came back, we came back to stay with them, that may have been, but -- but it’s -- I remember my mother being there for -- for that Christmas at -- at -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Madnas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And we may have had the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I do remember that, you know, seeing the decorations before, but that’s where sort of memories blend into each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Did you have any hobbies when you were a small child? </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Any -- or did you like sports?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Well, this was something that really was encouraged by my mother, who had a tremendous love for <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">My mother was also an accomplished painter, but I could never master that, but the writing -- I really did enjoy playwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And I also learned public speaking and the way that came about was kind of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">When we would go spend our weekends with the family in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijnsburg</span> , another religious angle, I would also always go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And after the church service I would be able to repeat the sermon that I had heard almost verbatim. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And so that’s -- that’s really where I learned public speaking, and I’ve -- I’ve always enjoyed that, and it’s -- it’s a very, very valuable experience I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">But the interesting thing 1s again, that my mother was not afraid to have me exposed to a variety of experiences, and then to know at the same time that my -- my Jewish foundations would remain very, very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">One more thing in the involvement in terms of the Jewish community in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> ; I mentioned, you know, attending services, but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">My guess is that it would probably have been ’46 - ’47 approximately, August 4, 2002 probably more ’47 because I remember where we lived at the t -- we were living at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">My mother already had her <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and she would dress me up as a Karen Kayemet collection box. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And I won second prize, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">First prize was to a girl who was dressed up as a Sabbath queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And that -- that was a very, very major event. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Actually, you know, now -- now that I think about it, prior to this Purim fe -- feast, 1t was also an even earlier experience that I had, which was a Hanukkah party earlier, because I remember very distinctly the kinds of gifts that we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And they were not toys, they were not books, they were socks and very common things that people needed immediately after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So that -- that probably was -- may have been the end of ’45 - ’46, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">As I remember also, related to that, going with my mother to -- to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where packages would arrive from overseas, and one of my mother’s brothers had survived and escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> and he arranged for packages to be sent from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And I remember going with my mother to collect those packages.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="834">ANSWER:  As far as we know, the -- the only person who -- who survived for sure was one of my mother’s brothers, Adolf, or Abraham Munzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And he managed to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on th -- right after, or right around Kristallnacht, and the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that he could go to was <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He had married a German woman who converted to August 4, 2002 Judaism, and they had one son, Norbert and the three of them managed to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">My mother’s sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was deported eventually, and -- with her family, her son Yossi, who was exactly the same age as Norbert, they sort of looked alike, and I have some beautiful photographs of the two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">But sh -- that part of the entire -- of the family was deported and all of the ones who remained behind, the immediate family that remi -- remained behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rymanow</span> , or my father’s side in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kanczuga</span> , they all died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">There were some cousins of my mother, an aunt of my mother who survived and we did not find out about that until we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">But she managed -- she survived with eight children, which was totally am-amazing, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  Were your parents strong Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  My mother was a member of some Zionist youth organizations, but I don’t know how strong Zionists they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">My mother, you know, did face the choice of after the war, whether we should come to -- go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I know it was a difficult choice for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">A lot of people did mo -- who we had contact with in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> came -- went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And it was probably about equally divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But she -- I guess I think she did not -- wasn’t ready for renewed hardship and she felt -- and that’s why we ca -- we eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , although that was not so many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">August 4, 2002

<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  All right, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So then your mother decided to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  That’s right, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> in 1952 and she sold her business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> and we then remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> until 1958 when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I attended <span class="BUILDING">scho</span> -- my -- my education continued in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and my mother made a decision that the s -- <span class="BUILDING">French speaking schools</span> were better than the a -- that the Dutch spe -- the <span class="BUILDING">Flemish schools</span> , so initially I went -- this -- this is where I did go to a full time <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> actually, called the E-Ecole Israel Elite in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> would pick us up every day, make the rounds and pick up the children for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Not a very big <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , probably had about a hundred students is my -- my guess, at most. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And I went there for approximately two years and then graduated and went to -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> they call it attenay or it’s li -- Lycée in French, or in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but basically that’s -- that’s seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I started the -- the <span class="BUILDING">Atheneum School</span> , and that was -- that was not a Jewish school. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">That was just a -- a <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> , in French.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  It was hard because we had very -- you know, as I said, we had many close friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">My mother attempted a -- a remarriage, it didn’t work out, she - August 4, 2002 it was someone, a man who was much older than she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">But at the same time, the positive thing that came out of that, we became very, very -- I became very close with his family in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , the Schumer family, and have maintained that friendship to the present day. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They were very, very warm, very supportive to me and to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Some of the members of the family live here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , lived there at the time, they were coming back and forth between <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and -- and -- and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and others lived in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And they -- so that became my next family. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I also became much more aware of -- of Jewish things, things Jewish after we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> had a much more active Jewish community, more <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">It even had some, as I said before, a -- a full time <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> that -- that had somehow survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  What about your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  And that’s where I had my Bar Mitzvah, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , actually, in a fairly small <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that was attached to a -- an old people’s home, <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="870"><span class="BUILDING">Nursing home</span> or <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen home</span> , and that’s where we had the Bar Mitzvah and it was very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I do remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  Did you have many friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  Fair number. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Not -- not a great number of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">The friends of the Schumer family, they were all there, but I -- we had some neighbors were friends, but ah, August 4, 2002 Jewish community even in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was fairly small, so certainly I did not have many, many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">But nothing again, that seemed out of the ordinary f- for me, simply because that’s the way things were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know, we weren’t -- it was much more of -- of a -- of a shock really, coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and becoming aware of the intensity of Jewish life and J-Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">That, you know, was just -- it’s a totally different scale.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  I did not enjoy the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> particularly, I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">It was -- I - | just did not particularly get along well with my teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It’s the only <span class="BUILDING">school</span> experience that I had that was negative, and I don’t know why it -- why that was particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I had a very good experience subsequently in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Belgian school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Atheneum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And did very wer -- well, even though French was a new language to me, but still, you know, did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">But there was some anti- Semitism there. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">It was very -- it was kind of subtle. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">There were several Jewish students in my class in the <span class="BUILDING">Atheneum</span> , and we had religious -- Jewish religious instruction in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">There’s no separation of <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and state in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And so the -- the probl -- the -- the s -- religion is handled differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">People -- students basically pick what religion -- religious instruction they want to August 4, 2002 attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So it could be protest -- they could go to a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant class</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Catholic class</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish class</span> , or one that was called ethics. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I did go to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> with a Mr. Deener, and I think, you know, the entire class we only had two or three students at any one time because there were so few Jews 1n the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">But then one time -- I did not -- there were classes on Saturday mornings, that was part of the regular school week, and I did not go to those classes on Saturday mornings, and I remember -- and the principal, you know, contacted my mother and said that I -- I was in danger of failing, you know, because, you know, the Jewish students, you know, were -- were staying away on Saturday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And that didn’t happen, the Jewish students graduated, you know, near the top of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But there was a -- that little bit, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Anti-Semitism actually, hadn’t thought of this, but certainly was prevalent also in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I -- I remember when I was walking back from <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> being pursued by kids yelling dirty Jew and things like that, or the equivalent in Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Was -- Jew with glasses was the term, I can’t translate it, burla yout. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And that’s -- that’s -- that was a very common thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So there was -- there was a fair amount --

ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We talked about 1t and my mother had similar experiences, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">One time she -- we were on -- in <span class="DLF">line</span> to go to a -- a movie and the newsreels. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And I don’t know, someone noticed my mother’s number and made a remark about, well there’s one they didn’t get. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">So it’s -- it’s -- there was still anti-Semitism after the war, certainly, in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">QUESTION:  So then you stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> until what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">ANSWER:  Well, in ninet -- I stayed -- I -- my mother stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> til 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> til 1956. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I had gone to summer came in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> sponsored by yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I’d been to several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> , but the last one I went to was one sponsored by a -- aj -- a -- a yeshiva, actually, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And they encouraged my mother to send me to a yeshiva full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I was not getting along with the man my mother had remarried and so that was one solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And plus the fact that, you know, I was really encouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So we -- I went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , a yeshiva in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called [indecipherable] and my mother took me there in -- in 1956 and that was a very, very wonderful experience, actually, a very, very positive experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">An extremely warm, caring atmosphere
QUESTION:  So it wasn’t hard for you to keep picking up and changing where you lived, I mean you -- you had already, at a young age, had made so many moves. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">But you were able to adapt to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">How do you explain that? </span><span class="sentence" id="922">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  I don’t know, but it’s -- it’s just -- it’s just the facts, you know, that I did really da -- did make many changes, and somehow this -- this was a very, very different atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Obviously this was a very Orthodox yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">It was -- the -- the head of the yeshiva was from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He was a student of the Chofetz Chaim, so it was -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">But I -- somehow managed to fit in very -- fairly quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Again, made very, very good friends very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And took charge actually of the -- volunteered to take charge of the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> , that was my first inkling of becoming a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">You know, all the students had different chores and my chores were in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="931">ANSWER:  No, I chose. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So that was the first time that I made, you know, the choice that I -- ultimately I was going to be a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Th-The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was sort of -- had -- had students from -- half the students were Ashkenazi and the other half were Sephardic from <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And so they -- that created -- there was an interesting dynamic. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">That was a whole different exposure again because they spoke Arabic, in addition to French and so to resolve that dilemma, the -- the head of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> actually decreed that were two languages that could not be spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">One was Yiddish and the other one was Arabic, they were forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And also, all the studying, everything was done in French as a result of that, which was very, very August 4, 2002 difficult for the head of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because his -- his French was -- was atrocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">But he was a very, very nice man who had been imprisoned during the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">His name was Haim Haiken. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And he died in er -- a very advanced age, in early 90’s.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  Di-Did you -- d-d -- were you upset that your mother wanted to move to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  No, because I knew that this situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was really not tenable. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">At one point I actually -- we had even planned on going to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">The reason we didn’t go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> earlier is because it took that many years to obtain a visa, because of the quota system. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And so we have -- we had applied for a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> in about 1954 or so, but then there was a flood in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and -- I may be off somewhat on my years, and all of a sudden we were told that the -- that I had -- that there was a visa for me to go to -- to th -- the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> opened the Dutch August 4, 2002 quota basically, because of the floods. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And so I got a visa and my mother assumed that she had one too, and she didn’t know about the visas being by national origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">So she did not -- was not able to come t -- [indecipherable] to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">But that’s -- as a result of that, we dropped our pla -- we had dropped our plans to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and -- so I was prepared for the change to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I had also -- I'd gotten different warnings. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I also -- the -- my -- my si -- teachers at the yeshiva and the older, more senior students, you know, warned me, said that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was extremely materialistic and I shouldn’t forget the things I had learned over there, you know, that -- and that one of the -- the lessons that I should take back from the war was that material objects were really not that important. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">There were more important things in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="982"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> over there was very, very much geared towards the Mussar ethical movement and was very, very valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So I was prepared for the worst in many ways when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but instead, I think both of us really adapted quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">We -- my mother purposely had booked a trip on -- that was fairly long because she -- she looked on this as kind of a- a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So our -- our trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> took about 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> made stops in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> before finally arriving in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> we were met by someone from the HIAS, August 4, 2002 Mrs. Citrin. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">By f -- our first exposure to a real American woman who was super- American.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  Did you know any English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  Very, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I had taken English as my second foreign language which -- which was really bare bones, was twice a week for about two years, so it was very, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But there was this -- this very swaggering woman, very, very different from -- yeah, the -- the very quiet European women we -- and that was -- that was intere -- and then we -- we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> to -- to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and joined -- and stayed with the Vanderpool family, who had -- since they originally -- they 1- initially had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamsburg</span> when they came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Hela Vanderpool had a job actually, in a matzo baking factory. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And then finally, you know, they -- they moved to a nicer part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">We moved in with them for a short period and got our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="998">ANSWER:  I very distinctly re -- remember seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">You know, we were having breakfast on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and there it was, and really -- it -- it si -- it did symbolize a tremendous amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">The other thing that really struck us as -- as we got off -- as we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> watching, you know, being processed August 4, 2002 on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , was they were -- the dockworkers were unloading things from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and that the dockworkers were wearing leather -- were wearing protective gloves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">That was one thing that really struck us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">The second thing that struck us, that on this big <span class="DLF">loading platform</span> at one point, they brought -- they dropped a newspaper and containers of coffee for the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And this was very, very different from working conditions in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And that -- those two things, the newspaper, especially, and the cups of coffee and the leather gloves, the protective gloves, somehow struck us as being very special and showing that -- you know, that things were much, much better in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">The other -- very shortly after our arrival, we also -- we started looking for permanent <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live and -- which is quite an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">We ended up in some of the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> of -- of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> before we finally found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but -- and my mother had to look for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And I remember visiting the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I think it was either the HIAS, or there was another organization called New Americans, which was -- and this was on <span class="DLF">Beekman Place</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , not far from <span class="DLF">Wall Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And I remember one of the first things we visited was -- was <span class="BUILDING">Trinity Church</span> and -- and the <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> , and how impressed we were to see this old <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> next to <span class="DLF">Wall Street</span> over these- these <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">That was also a very, very positive impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And we both feel -- felt -- my mother, I know, felt liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">She really is the one who wanted to August 4, 2002 leave behind the memories of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">She found Europe extremely confining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">The memories were bad, but in addition to that, she -- she did not -- she did not like being referred to as the widow Munzer, which was how women were still regarded, single women, widowed women in -- in -- in Europe were still regarded at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Whereas here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> she could get a job and make a living, and she would just be like anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B

And you’ve arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , did you -- and where did you eventually live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  We actually lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was almost next door to the Vanderpool family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">There were some people who -- these were two family, two si -- <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and we took an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> next door to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And we stayed there for several years and then moved to an o -- to a larger <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> a little bit further away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">My mother, almost immediately got -- got work, went to work in the -- the ladies’ garment business, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">She made -- she had a variety of jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">One of them was making hats, all sorts of things, til she finally got as -- a job that she kept for a long period of time, which was working as a t -- at a tailor in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">women’s store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">The August 4, 2002 reason she took that particular job, which was on <span class="DLF">Williams Street</span> , again, and <span class="DLF">Wall Street</span> , was because it was closed on Shabbas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And by then my mother really had become much more observant and she would go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> every -- every Shabbas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So that -- that became very important for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">QUESTION:  Considering what she had gone through during the war, how was her health?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  My mother was in very, very good health, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Had -- had no -- was never si- never sick at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Had no -- no major health -- no health problems that I know of at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">QUESTION:  And your health was good, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">ANSWER:  Yeah, I had no -- no problems in spite of, you know, malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I’m told that there’s some dental problems, probably from early, you know, development that may be related to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">My mother was concerned about my health early on, but there really weren't any -- any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">After we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , started looking for a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me and I enrolled actually at -- I -- we -- we explored one of the more religious inst -- yeshiva, Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in -- in- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">But that was in a -- in a -- in a very ver -- bad <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and my mother wanted -- but by then I was beginning to think really of -- of eventually going to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And so my mother really wanted me to go to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was more progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">That’s why I went to Yeshiva University High School in August 4, 2002 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And it was a -- that was a very -- it was a difficult move because I knew- spoke very, very little English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And I must say that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not supportive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">No one at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> asked any questions about how I had survived, how my mother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">It -- it’s unfortunately left a sour taste in my -- in my mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">The students were very, very friendly and the students were very interested in my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And I still have an article that they wrote for the school newspaper, actually an interview about my experiences in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">So it’s -- it’s -- but the adults were just -- I -- I -- for whatever reason, no one wants to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">The only person who really asked us about our survival, how we had survived, it was very interesting, it was someone who wasn’t Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">It was when my mother went to open up a bank account at Manufacturer’s Trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And when the -- the woman who read the application, she called over the bank manager and they were both in tears practically, when they found out my father had died and how he had died and -- and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">That was -- but that was unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Most people -- there were some other people, obviously, who had been through similar experiences we talked to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">We went to a small <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , Rabbi Moshe Weiss, and he had lost much of his own family and certainly we were very close with him and we talked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">But other than that, certainly at Yeshiva University High School there was no -- there was no talk about the Holocaust at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And I -- I was asked to take every single Regent’s exam for the August 4, 2002 entire four years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in that one year because they were afraid really of -- of giving me a diploma without doing that, so I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">But it -- I -- the unfortunate thing is that it’s probably as a result of that experience that I did not go -- did not attend <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I was interviewed there and would have gone there, but ended up going to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And that’s where I graduated from eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And that was a very good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And the interesting thing is that over there there were the beginnings of talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">At least there were other foreign students and there was some interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">But I felt very much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , felt very comfortable there, made good friends and really blended in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">QUESTION:  So you did not feel like an outsider?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">ANSWER:  Definitely not, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I -- o-or if I did, it was -- it was something positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">But I no - definitely felt a part of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1065">QUESTION:  And you obviously picked up English quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">ANSWER:  Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I had a -- I did have a -- a very heavy accent, initially, because I - and I had a very, very good speech teacher, Professor Dorothy Lawson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And she spent hours with me with a tape recorder, and I would listen to my voice and then she would make corrections and she taught me the international phonetic alphabet, and that’s how I learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">August 4, 2002

<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  No, I did -- I did not feel like any stranger, refugee or foreigner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I never really found that an obstacle at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I found it really a positive -- I tried to -- to use it as a positive experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">You know, certainly all of the different exposures that I had to different people, different cultures, different religions, I -- I tie th -- try to keep that basically as part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And I think to this day it’s -- 1t’s something that has -- has helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">August 4, 2002

[</span><span class="sentence" id="1086">indecipherable] everybody has wonderful experiences, but we were being interviewed -- we were interviewed by someone who basically told us that -- said, you know, remember in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you don’t do what you want, you do as you are told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">This <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is run like the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And that -- that was pa -- horrible, you know, and the man tried to trick me in -- in the citizenship questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">He threw my -- my mother’s green card and mine on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">The positive thing that came out of that is that I wrote a letter of complaint to the Immigration Naturalization Service, which initially -- and to the Justice Department, which at that time was headed by Bobby Kennedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I did not get a reply, but then wrote to Emmanuel Seller, who was my congressman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and who was head of the Judiciary Committee and I got immediate action, they actually -- there was a hearing held in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I was confronted -- and the man was forced to apologize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And I think h-he retired shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So it -- it did show the negative and the positive, you know, the fact that you can stand up and -- for your rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">QUESTION:  Did he give a reason at the hearing why he treated you that way? </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">August 4, 2002
ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">You know, it’s -- it’s interesting because the -- the hearing examiner told me that this man had never even served in the army, and why he was making the reference to the army was bizarre, and he didn’t -- he said he didn’t know whether the man was having a bad day, or what it was, but obviously the behavior was -- was totally -- was inappropriate.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1104">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I have a partner, Joel Wind and we’ve known each other for 21 years and we’ve lived together here for about 11 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And I’m very, very close to his family, another survivor family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Joel’s father is a rabbi and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1938 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , and -- on a scholarship to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theological Seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Joel has -- had an aunt who actually was one of the people who lived in August 4, 2002 the sewers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So there are a lot of connections, family connections and I’m -- I’m very, very close to Joel’s family and we are one family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Now let’s talk a little bit about some of your general thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Though, before we do that, you kept up your relationships with the mand -- Madnas I assume, all through -- once you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">ANSWER:  A-After we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I did keep up my relationship with the Madnas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">For many years it was just writing and sometimes, you know, there would be -- months would go by before I would write, but we always stayed in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I did not go back for a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> until I think in 1973, 15 years after we had been here is when I -- when I went back on a visit and spent a lot of time -- primarily went back to visit the Madnas, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And Papa Madna was as protective of me as he had ever been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I had never been to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">My mother had always said negative things about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , she sa -- basically she said my father did not like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , it was too noisy and that’s why he lived -- they lived in -- in The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And so, as a result of that, I had never gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And I decided that on this trip I was going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and Papa Madna again, almost completely dissuaded me from going altogether, then scared me so much that I went there for one day and then came right back t-to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And -- but that’s -- that still 1s the -- the -- the influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">You -- you asked earlier August 4, 2002 about whether my mother was -- was protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I have the sense -- I had the sense really that 1-in many ways he was more protective of me than she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">That was very, very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And he -- he had remarried in 1947, and I was very, very close with this second wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And they had three children, Vonny, Tolé and Matipah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And I was very, very close with all three of them, and remain close with them to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Vonny Madna and his wife Annika have been here to visit, and just a few weeks ago, their son Rodewick and his girlfriend came over here for a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And so the -- we’re -- we’re passing on the -- the accomplishments or -- of his -- of his grandfather, or -- of Tolé Madna now to the next generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I think that’s what the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is all about in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">We had a -- a wondert -- we had -- we visited the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> together and the importance of a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and of a <span class="BUILDING">memorial</span> suddenly hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Prior to that I thought that people could get information from books, but there is something very special about a <span class="BUILDING">memorial</span> , in terms of the passage from one generation to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">When you went back t -- at Papa Madna’s funeral, did you feel like you were losing a father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1134">ANSWER:  What do yo -- yes, I think when he f -- when he finally -- I -- you know, he was - even though we were far removed geographically, he really remained very much a part of my life to the very end, and -- and certainly, you know, his -- his death was - August 4, 2002 was a big loss for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Fortunately he lived to a -- a ripe, old age, and fortunately, you know, we were able, Joel and I were -- were able to spend time with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">It was very important for me for Joel to get to know him, and we made several trips together where we saw the Madnas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I made that initial trip by myself in 1973, but then in 1985 Joel and I were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> together and visited the Madnas, all of them, and it was a -- a very, very good visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And then Joel and I were back again just before Tolé Madna died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And that too, was very, very special visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  Did you speak at his funeral?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">ANSWER:  No, Rob Madna is the one who spoke at the funeral, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">But Rob Madna- I can’t remember ma -- whether I did or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">QUESTION:  Are you angry that you had to go through such terrible difficulties and such terrible losses and other people living, let’s say in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , did not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">ANSWER:  You know, there were times when I really miss not knowing, not having had, you know, my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Not having nephews, nieces and nephews and feeling lonely at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I certainly have missed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The interesting thing 1s that I really have never, you know, you -- you mentioned the word angry, and I don’t think that describes it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I don’t think I’ve ever really felt anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">It’s -- it’s very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">When Joel and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , for example, he was much angrier than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I was able to speak and converse with people without, you know, difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">We had August 4, 2002 one very special experience there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">We were staying again in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I stayed with my mother, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Ischl</span> , and we had ma -- made reservations 1n a -- in an <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> , and the woman who was the innkeeper, when we arrived told us that she had made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">She said, you know, you’re going to have to change <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> tomorrow morning because of some mistake I’ve made in the reservations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And I told her that would be very difficult because we were going to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> first thing in the morning to visit my father’s <span class="DLF">grave</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And the woman told me that her family -- she burst out in tears and she says, you know, my family is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> and I am so ashamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And we hugged, and that -- that was truly an incredible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">But Joel would not -- would barely look out the <span class="DLF">train window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">He -- he could not bring himself to say anything positive about <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and couldn’t wait to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">That’s one reason we did not -- this was around my - the time of my father’s Yahrzeit and so we visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> and then from there, instead of going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and said Kaddish in the <span class="BUILDING">Altneu shul</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  Do you feel you had a childhood, or you never did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  Well, it was a very different childhood probably, but I -- I definitely, you know, definitely had the childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I had a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">M -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I was taken care of by many different people and I was fortunate, I think, in having a read August 4, 2002 childhood, a good childhood, and learning many different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And I -- I think I - because of the unusual nature of my childhood, I had had many opportunities that other kids probably did not have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So I was able to learn several languages and be exposed to many different cultures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">QUESTION:  Are there any sights today or sounds or smells that kind of trigger memories from your early years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  Well, when we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> , I smelled the coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And there was something very special about the smell of Dutch coffee, and that -- that was very, very distinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And of course, you know, Indonesian cooking still ha -- is a -- something very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And I -- I do enjoy, you know, going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the sights of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And I do enjoy going back to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , the places where I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at van Kinsbergenstraat, number 40 doesn’t exist any more, but other <span class="NPIP">places</span> are still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Where my father had his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , that’s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">I’ve taken Joel there on a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So -- the -- the one <span class="NPIP">place</span> that- that gave me some difficulty was the <span class="BUILDING">Anne Frank house</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">It’s interesting, you know, you mention the word anger, maybe there I did feel some anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And the first time I went there was with my foster sister, with Davy and both of us had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">She more so than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">For her it just brought back too many memories and she -- she really was very upset, very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">In my case, it -- it was August 4, 2002 just wanting to shout out, you know, there were other people like Anne Frank, like myself, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And --
QUESTION:  Do you feel very Dutch, or very American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  I think I feel very American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">You know, I think the Dutch has sort of faded, although, you know, I -- I -- I still pride myself on being able to read Dutch -- Dutch newspapers and being able to converse in Dutch, but I -- I don’t really feel -- and my mother did not have any -- any great affinity to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">My mother, I think, really understood also, that there was a large Nazi presence in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> itself, and that -- that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> really never faced up to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Apparently that has changed and now there is -- there is -- 1t’s been -- there’s mo-more talk about the Dutch Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">It’s one of the things that even in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> doesn’t get enough emphasis is -- 1s the size of the Dutch Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">It’s -- it’s sort of between the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , when you look at the -- the percentage of people who lost -- or Jews who lost their lives, the greatest percentage was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But then there’s nothing said about it and why that was, and part of the reason was that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had a very large Nazi party which collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So we -- we know about the Vichy regime in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but we don’t know enough about the Nazi collaborators in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">As you’ve gotten older, do you think more of your wartime experience than European experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1195">ANSWER:  I think it -- it’s become more important for me to -- to really preserve the memory of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and of the story of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And I’m -- I’m very, very glad I’ve had the opportunity to sit down with my mother and go through all the names of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that she was in and sit down with a map with her, and -- and have a presentation p -- on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That -- that -- that was very, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Emotionally it’s very hard to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">You know, at times I have dreams about it that obviously come from there, and -- but it’s not a part of my -- my everyday life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I also -- sometimes I’m concerned that there are people who may resent talk about the Holocaust, and the experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">So it’s -- there’s some -- there’s a little bit of caution there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1202">QUESTION:  Are you talking about non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">ANSWER:  No, more in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">There is -- there is some feeling, I think that enough is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">At times I have -- I have a sense of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">QUESTION:  Are you more comfortable around people who were born in Europe and have wartime experiences than others who grew up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">No, I think it’s -- it’s really m-most of my friends now and most of the friends we have are p -- are people who grew up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">But you August 4, 2002 know even when you begin to talk to people, you -- you realize that -- how common the experience really is, and I’m -- people may have been born here, but their parents may be from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I had a ni -- a fascinating experience very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I - I was speaking to a young man at <span class="BUILDING">Congregation Bet Mishpachah</span> and he -- his name is -- his last name is Flatow, Warren Flatow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I told him, I said, you know, Flatow is not a very common name, and I worked with a gentleman many, many years ago who was a -- was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a German refugee and whose last name was Flatow, Anzd Flatow, and he said -- and he worked as a translator and I worked in the same <span class="BUILDING">translation bureau</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> while I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And he -- he said, gee, you know, he has a grandfather the same name, but his grandfather was a lawyer and to his knowledge never worked in the <span class="BUILDING">translation bureau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Then he asked his father and it turned out to be the same Anzd Flatow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And we worked together at the Lawyers and Merchants Translation Bureau in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And he was, you know, had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1944 and was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Obviously couldn’t do any work as a lawyer in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so he took this job as a translator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So the -- the connections are many, once you begin talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">August 4, 2002
QUESTION:  Did you go into medicine -- though I know you said you -- you thought about it early on, but do you think you went into this helping, giving profession because of what you experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1220">ANSWER:  Pro -- probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">It probably was one of the factors, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Certainly my mother always impressed on me that I was there to serve human kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And I don’t want to be overly dramatic about it, but that goes all the way back to -- to her reading the story of -- the biblical story of --
QUESTION:  Of -- of Hannah [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Oh Hannah, right, the biblical story of Hannah, and -- and Hannah’s promising to -- to -- you know, to have her son, you know, be in -- of service to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And that story really stuck to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">My mother said, you know, that I too, that’s the promise that she made to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And when times were bad, when I -- I would give her trouble or something like that, she would repeat that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">My mother never hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">She never spanked me, but she certainly used every psychological means, and that was one of them, and you know, and so becoming a physician -- she wanted me to be a rabbi, she didn't want me to be a physician, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">End of Tape Three, Side B August 4, 2002 Beginning Tape Four, Side A
QUESTION:  This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Alfred Munzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">This is tape number four, side A, and you were talking about your relationship with your mother and how she was -- she wanted you to be a rabbi and not a doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">ANSWER:  Sh-She felt that I was more suited -- that I was really suited to becoming a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">She -- she felt that I would not do well in -- in hav -- in business, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">She just -- she thought that I was too, quote, honest, and that -- you know, that that -- so she wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to acquire a family, in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">But she was basically, as to a large extent on -- on the respect that rabbis have in -- in Europe, especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">When we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> she realized that -- that rabbis do not necessarily have it all that easy here, and that <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> can be very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">So anyway, but -- but -- I had really never considered that that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">It was a -- was a brief consideration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">The oth -- the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> where that came from, being a rabbi was, strangely enough, the family that we used to visit in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rijnsburg</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and who would take me to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and then I would repeat the sermons and one of the women there would say oh, he’s going to become a preacher and then the other one would say, no, he’s going to become a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And so that was -- that was one of the early things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">But it August 4, 2002 was -- those were the two professions that I really considered seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">But from -- from my standpoint it was really all -- I -- I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Maybe it was when I was really sick as a child and had the ruptured appendix. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">That’s, I think, when I really made up my mind that I was going to become a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">But my experiences of -- of -- certainly of having had my life given to me in a -- in a very direct sense by -- by the Madna family, I would say probably it has had a major impact, not just on becoming a physician but also volunteering my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">When I picked a specialty it was one where I -- I knew I could have a wider -- I wanted one where I could have a wider impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And so I chose lung disease because lung disease is so much related to -- to an -- the environment, it’s related to smoking and I became very active in the American Lung Association and eventually served as -- as president of the American Lung Association, nationally, and also received their Will Ross medal a few years ago, which 1s their highest volunteer honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So at -- it’s -- that certainly -- and it, interestingly enough, at that ceremony the story, the Madna story was told very, very prominently and to -- to an audience of thousands of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And the Madnas received a standing ovation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">They weren’t there, but you know, just -- it was -- 1t was extremely moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So my past, my experiences certainly have been a very important part of forming my life and of determining the kind of person I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And I guess it’s possible for that, depending on the August 4, 2002 experiences, to be positive or negative and I’m very fortunate that in my case, it was very positive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">QUESTION:  In talking about the Madnas, did you -- have you come to any conclusion why Mr. Madna really risked his life for you?</span></p>
