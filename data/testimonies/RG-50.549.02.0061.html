<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  So there were six of you altogether?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Right, six brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  I’m correcting that because much of the Holocaust material said seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Any time that you have any question, I’d be glad to answer it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  And both your parents were -- were Jewish, and brought you up in -- practicing a sort of Orthodox Jewish faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Right, exactly, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  I was interested in the fact that you were educated privately --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  -- and I wonder if you’d tell me more about -- more about that, and also the fact that after the age of 14 or 15, you were given more freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes, that’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I -- I was raised in a strict Orthodox family, more or less my father belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hassidim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And -- but the only difference was, he was not a fanatic either. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We had been <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- three brothers and sister, we always brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> Zionist organization’s books. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We had to do always -- parents, my father’s j-job was to keep us busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So we could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Our education, he never rejected it, or tell us he want us to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And actually, what we used to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , always books, and all those brothers and sisters, he practically read all books, although he was more a model Orthodox person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  And was it usual to give young men much more freedom when they reached the age of 14 or 15?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  More or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I think this what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Til 14 - 15, actually, we had to go along always, like the services, special on Shabbas, on holidays, we always went along with my father, and it would be not nice for us not to go along, so we went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But after we had been 15 years old, we still went for education, Jewish religion, and higher learnings. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But my father had enough, was wise enough to see that the world is changing, and you cannot stay always in -- how he would like it, so he gave us more -- all brothers and sisters, freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">After fif -- 15, we could d -- go our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  I wonder if you’d also tell me how you viewed your family’s position. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">In the -- the videotaped interview, your -- you cover your family history, but would you tell me whether they should be regarded as urban or rural? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">As middle class, as a better off family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Oh, our family was a very great family, with lots of love. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Kids for parents, and vice versa, parents for kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Our economical status was fairly good, better than average. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And the most of all, 1t cannot go higher with regards in us to our parents, and vice versa, the parents to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I feel that love like this cannot be greater, and will never be greater, at the times what I spent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and close the circle with our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  And I assume that it’s that family background that enabled you to -- to cope with life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  This is a question actually, I cannot answer too good of it, because under the circumstances, I practically gave up life the day when I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">This was in January, must been around July or August, and I was integrated for Gestapo, and beaten unmerciful, but I was -- the most fear was, for me actually, beating, because they used to beat me when I was interviewed by Gestapo, til I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">When I passed out, they didn’t have running water, over there at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , they dragged me out to a <span class="DLF">well</span> , where they poured water on my head, and I was revived, dra- dragged back <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and again beating, and beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And this was my biggest fear of it was beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I begged the officer who interviewed me to shoot me on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He laughed, and he told me, “You don’t have to worry about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">You don’t nec -- you don’t have to expect tha -- that you will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But we finish you off not when you want it, we finish you when we want it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="60">This was the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did you ever know why they were questioning you, and what information they wanted to get from you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Yes, it’s a big story, I gonna try to -- just to tell you in more details. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We had business, all kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> -- my parents started actually, with a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , good business. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in his 20’s, early 20’s, and he slowly took over business by our parents, and he always looked at a <span class="BUILDING">food store</span> , little <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , we could make a living, he made a living, but he couldn’t make money all the -- actually for a better life. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So he started it, he -- he was a representative -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> was four smaller <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And the mostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn’t the most cheapest actually, tableware, what you can have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And this used to be shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galeetsia</span> , farther down near the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> where we had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And my brother used to supply raw materials, and apparently, I don’t know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the supplies profit. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season mostly in those <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , smaller fat -- f -- smaller <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> was about four or five months of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were slack. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , not for a favor, but actually to make some money, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So they paid so much percentage per month, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Then finally he invested in one particular <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , it belongs to a Gentile in out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , his name was Rochinsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed us, So he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And this went on til war time [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother realized it’s another -- a different era already. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We -- as being well and everything, but we realized that we shouldn’t show that we had any interest in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , because we know it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Nobody went down, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to get the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get familiar with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother said, “Don’t mention any more, you stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like anybody else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And take -- in 19 -- the end of ’39, we had to go in to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and life got terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for Gentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn’t got. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> was very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to pay 10 times the value, and so any other products. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well, life got to get very expensive until 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo, because he was more or less a intelligent person. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They had been scared, the Germans didn’t trust the more intelligent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And he was taken in the 40’s, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">After two, three weeks -- we didn’t know much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in 1940, but after two, three weeks, came a telegram that he’s not any more alive, and his clothing was sent back to his widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm band with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The green band meant actually that you are privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , or go out after seven o’clock from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to be seen on a <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They had still curfew for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And everywhere, wherever, you couldn’t move freely, but if you had a green band, you could ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you had been -- you could move freely, you could go out after seven o’clock actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And this was a -- of course, the German government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So many pounds, was -- I don’t know exactly, they gave you a green band that you are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- forced to perform some labor for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , otts -- clean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was assigned in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it - in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don’t know exactly either, how many hours we worked, we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and spend with our family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">This went on, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too, that I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">True, he had some connections in a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Bribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get favors from them, and they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">When my brother arranged the same way, he had to pay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , that my assignment will be to put in labor in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">At this time the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able to manage a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , she didn’t know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Besides this, when the German came in, they right away, they froze all salaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Practically anyplace where s -- they had [indecipherable] employees, they couldn’t pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war wages. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for themselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four or five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">When I -- when I had the permission to go down perform my job in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , my brother set me up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the war, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four times as much as they earned b-before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they should be -- come to work to do their job, and we will pay them real good. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I started to organize, and this -- people started to come back, until I opened the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and started to produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But, it was a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">You had to have books, because you never know when the German government going to come to check your books. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So e -- we have been forced to have double bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">One set of book was actually what we did pay them. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Same way we used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to <span class="BUILDING">dealers</span> , we sold mostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and they paid us the same way, two, three times this amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But the point was we still had to keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in °41, one of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already, and he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And he got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and he went to Gestapo, and he told them that the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> actually belongs more to us than it belongs to her, it’s a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish factory</span> , and he told all kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">For example, we used to have, when we finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our merchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they will confiscate everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far away from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and it used to be hidden aboll where we could always ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to confiscate the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the merchandise 1s in a aboll in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And finally, one day, like I said, must have been July or August, a policeman came to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he said that I should come down to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">jontamarie</span> , where they had their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Normally, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we didn’t had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , only jontamarie we had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don’t know exactly, they used to come in a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , SS, they -- if they had any complaints to take care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And iva the policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I remember, and I can remember it exactly like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I looked at my mother, and I saw her face, and it didn’t help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother, and so my father, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I went down in a sleeveless shirt --
QUESTION:  Let me go back and ask --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  -- ask you to describe your mother’s expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Because that would be something that’s always stayed with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Expression of my mother was -- it’s unforgettable, because like I just said, it’s exactly -- I can see it with my eyes right now, how her expression was -- she felt scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">She didn’t know it -- what it will happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I could read anything what she had in her mind, I saw it with my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I saw my father -- I was sleeveless, I didn’t took even my jacket, and I told them, I ha -- I practically shivered, and I said, “Please don’t worry about it, I will be back in a couple hours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But --
QUESTION:  Also, have you thought about why they -- why they took you? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Was it because you were younger, and might speak more freely? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Why they took you, and not your older brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Because I was in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  And your older brother, Haim?</span></p>

QUESTION:  I see, so you did know more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  -- actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And so the -- everything -- whatever he mentioned it, he mentioned me as a -- you know, the double bookkeeping, and everything that I was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And so this why they called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I went down, it was a pretty warm day, and I came down over there, and I was called in in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where I saw a very high officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I couldn’t tell his rank, I’m not familiar, but he was a very high officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I looked, he had a stack of papers, maybe two, three inches high, and he start to ask me questions, if I am in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> over there, if I help manage the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And right away I realized, when I saw this stack of papers, I realized what the questions are, that he knows more than I myself know, because of I realized that it’s no use to lie, and I start to tell anything fully -- fully to cooperate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But this was not a big deal, cooperation did not help to save me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He called in two strong guys from the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Young guys, strong guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And they had like a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , like to lay down on it, not to sit, but -- on my belly to lay over there, that my back, everything is exposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And they came in with -- the -- the SS and Gestapo, they used to carry, when they went on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , made from leather -- I don’t know even how they call this in English, I don’t recall, exactly, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You know, for beating somebody, just on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They saw a Jewish kid, or whatever, they beat over the head with it, something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And they told me to lay down on my belly on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , whatever it was, it was built special for this purpose, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And in both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , right and left, kept on pounding in my body, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And actually, it’s impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I was young, and strong at this time, maybe, but beating like this, I don’t think any human can take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And I used to pass out. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When I passed out, they dragged me out to the <span class="DLF">well</span> , they pumped water on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">As soon I came back, they dragged me back in, and again and again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I always was more on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> anyway, especial with the beating, I couldn’t stand straight any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They didn’t give you a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , and so you had a choice, all to be on your all four on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , or actually -- you know, to stay, you couldn’t stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was always on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I went -- he was sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , he had very polished, high boots on it, and I remember I practically was very -- pretty close to his boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I told him in German, “Please shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Please finish me off.” </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And he laughed, looked in my eyes, he said, “You don’t have to worry about this, but we finish you off when we want it, not when you want it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And this went on hours and hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">This was actually -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  What would be the reason why your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was spared, when much of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was burned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  This 1s a -- this is the same way, this -- you cannot ans -- for a question like this, this just happened to be that the -- first was burned the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , what this was once in the -- famous all over the world, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but all over the world, was a famous for art, and beauty, and anything what is possible, actually, to describe this <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And the reason was actually the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was near a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> what it went through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pilitsa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And it was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> actually was a <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It was not a heavy structure, a <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And when the Germans invaded, I remember it was on a Friday, the first of September was on a Friday when they c -- yeah, it was a Friday, and Saturday they have been already over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And so the first thing what they did, they tried to secure the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , they -- they can come in and cross wherever they wanted with their armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So they put the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> on fire, after they went in, and this was near the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and because the structure was a wooden structure, apparently -- I don’t know, maybe they put bombs -- firebombs actually on it before -- this 1 -- I don’t know either, because I actually, myself, and so the -- mostly of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , run away in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So we didn’t know exactly, but we know it right away the next day, that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Actually, it was nothing left over from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">This -- this all as I can recall, actually.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  That’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  And I want to fill in some gaps from that earlier interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Okay, go ahead, whatever you ask, I will -- 1f I can answer [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">One of the questions was when you were living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> , the main <span class="NPIP">place</span> , actually, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> it was the name, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> was the -- a divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">On one side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pilitsa</span> , where the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was, was the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chadbush</span> , when you crossed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , they called it <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vidamma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Actually, it was the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but it still, this was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chadbush</span> , and this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vidamma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when they had to leave everything, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and anything, and go, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was actually made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vidamma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The reason was because it was already a little bit out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and it was easier to petition it off with wires, or whatever, to make it that you cannot just walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as a free person. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And this was the easiest thing, cause of the German decided that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vidamma</span> wi -- will be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and this actually where all Jews, including my family, lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vidamma</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  I want to fill in another -- another <span class="DLF">gap</span> , or clarify something, and this is moving ahead to when you were in -- I think it’s pronounced <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Javishavitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Yavishavitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">This is actually -- I was four weeks -- probably it’s mentioned the same way, my first tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I went -- after the beating, they took me down, back to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and I didn’t know it even at this time, that the widow from the owner, actually, she was a -- she was not Jewish, a Gentile, and she was arrested too, for the same crime like me, that we had double bookkeeping, that we had hidden finished merchandise, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So she was arrested, and I never knowed it -- that -- til he -- until four weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But I -- I was -- first they put me in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> was not a official -- a big <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , was a very small -- in fact, they used to call it- | don’t know the name, accosa. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">A big <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> is like jeminale, you know, but this was a small -- it was just for drunks, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Not too much, you know, criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And they hold me overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When I came to this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , -- oh the first -- this was the first time in my life I came in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , but we used to hear stories, if you have been a newcomer in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , they made jokes with you, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">This was the fun -- this how -- it used to be a custom, and -- when you was a newcomer in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">When I came in over -- to this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , actually, they probably realized I couldn’t walk straight, and mine back, everything, was black practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But for some reason, they didn’t perform all those jokes, what they used to do it for a newcomer. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And they felt more or less like sorry for me, you know, that I was all beaten up, so they let me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a policeman, he was in charge of this small <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And he knowed my parents, or he knowed me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So he came over to me, he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not Germans, but a Pole, and he came over, and he asked me if I want write <span class="BUILDING">home</span> something to m -- to my parents about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">At first I hardly could even take a pencil, my hand to write any words, but I -- I said it’s necessary to write <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the same way I think on the ID cards what they distributed in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , what I took part those -- they have this saying in sayvay things like this you cannot forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I said in my few words what I was writing, I told them please -- twice I said please, please forget about me, I be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Go on with your life, noble. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Just forget about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> still. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">This was my last word to my parents and family. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The next morning they took me -- they brought me -- it’s just 40 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> , and the name is Koinsket. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">This is a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for the -- for -- mostly for people who don’t obey the law, whatever, but it was much, much larger. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I was brought in over there, first they took me to Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koinsket</span> , and I was real -- really concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I-I didn’t care, I was afraid just for more beating, that I couldn’t take it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So I -- every minute I was over there, I just kept on looking when they start -- going to start to beat me again, but they never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They brought me over to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">When I came into the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , I was released, that -- at least I wasn’t beaten any more, I came in over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And the same thing, I know the procedure again, that those all in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> gonna make -- have fun, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And they saw me coming in, and the same way they felt sorry for me, and they know it that I’m not a criminal, and they realize that -- why I am over there, because it was involved for politics too, because the bookkeeper from our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> used to always to give me a -- handle over some mimeographs that used to come from the underground, from the -- <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to tell you how the front goes on over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And so he told them that I -- I have knowledge about the underground, too, was a -- this was part why I was arrested, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And they kept on coming, talking this over, how I behaved, and -- and I did whatever they told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We have been in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , probably was over there the same way, between 30 and 40 people, and everybody has a -- like in a corner, in a straw sack he had over there where you rested overnight to sleep, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">In the same way it was no modern facilities in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We used to have a large can, real huge, and everybody -- what a human has to do it, or -- they did everything the whole night, in this large kettle -- can, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And in the morning it was always they changed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Two people, they used to carry out, and take care, and then was to sc-scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , to keep it clean, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I recall after a f-few days that -- certain the third day, the fourth day, it was -- I was 1n the <span class="DLF">line</span> to carry this out, and scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , and so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I went over to do it, I didn’t look that somebody should do for me any favors, I went over like any other prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And then one Pole came, and pushed me away, and he said he will do this for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I -- I didn’t want to fight it, I let him do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And the same way, after a few days, maybe after a week, the one who was in charge, like the warden in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , he was not German, he was Polish, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So he called me in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he came to me, I went down from that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And he told me, “Don’t be upset, you probably -- your brothers are working for you that you going to be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">You will probably be -- be released 1f not this week, is next week, a third week. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But they work for you, to release you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It meant that they going to bribe the Gestapo for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And he says, “I know -- they are in contact with me, and I will see that you get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">You don’t have to eat that food from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Somebody will bring in every day, food for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And so you going to have private food, not from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But,” he said, “just -- this 1s a secret.” </span><span class="sentence" id="251">This is a very dangerous thing, I should never tell nobody what happened, what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">He will see that I will be supplied with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I noticed that actually that it changed a little bit, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I felt more comfortable, and so were all those other in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , the other person thas this -- they didn’t know it, where I was exactly, but -- this was a secret when I called into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , to this warden. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But they saw something goes on, so I didn’t say a word, but they felt that I am better treated like anybody else, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And so they tried, actually, always, what I had to do, they jumped in, pushed me away, and they used to do it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And we got along fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">This was -- actually, in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> over there, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koinsket</span> , I was four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I remember one day they brought in two Jewish people, because I was the only Jew on the -- in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But they brought in a couple Jewish people, I know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vidamoff</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They used to be butcher -- butchers, and they got caught by the German authority that they butchered a cow, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They took them, they put them -- they brought them over to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And I can recall normally they have not been so religious people, a butcher, whatever, but one had along with him a prayer book, and the whole night he didn’t do nothing else, except he kept on praying from the prayer book. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Prays -- was it -- to me it was not strange, 1t was familiar, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And I ask myself, he’s not such hot religious person, why does he pray so much? </span><span class="sentence" id="267">What is happen, early in the morning, maybe five o’clock, still was dark, they called off their name, they took them out, and we heard a few shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The others in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> told me, “You know, they got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They killed them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Over there, outside the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I didn’t know now -- think I didn’t know it, if they are dead, if it’s true what they told me, but I know it -- it’s fa -- was not just calling off a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We heard shots.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  Do you know why they were killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  Yeah, because the same way, it was not allowed to butcher anything, especial on the kashrut you know, by a rabbi, and everything, this was their things, you -- this was not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">In fact, it was those -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so crowded, if a Christian, a Pole, start to bring in food to sell on -- for -- for profit, on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , whatever, and he got caught by gendarmarie, whatever, they put them in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">R -- they didn’t dare to -- even to bring in food, even to make money, they been scared for their own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  You said something that inter -- interested me earlier, which was that the Gestapo may have felt you had knowledge of the underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Yeah, they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Tell me more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  The bookkeeper in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , he was probably -- oh, probably eight or 10 years older than me, because he was married, and had I think, two, three kids already. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And he used to like, you know, to drink a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He was -- he was a brilliant man, a brilliant mind, very brilliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">His name was Levandoski, and he for some reason, he liked me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Was he a Gentile, or a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  A Gentile, yeah, a Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He liked me, and they didn’t know it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he used to take me along to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , where he used to buy -- h-he -- he da -- was not so well off, you know, but he used to buy me that I drink with him together, and I used to do it, actually, because he wasn’t much older than me, and young people -- young boys like me, I was at this time 20 -- 19 years old, so it was for me a privilege. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my parents used to think that I am sick, because they served dinner, and I didn’t eat it, I was not hungry, because I ate with him in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And the ta -- same way that he had touch with the underground, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He used to take me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , even <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , what is not allowed heah to foreign language -- <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> , and he used to, on short wave he get always, he got BBC, and plus he used to get once a month, a mimeograph, a little thing, they told you on the front what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And he always shared with me, he really kept me -- I don’t know why, but like I would be his closest buddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And he actually was arrested, too, before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They send him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the same way, after a week, two, he came a telegram, he’s not alive any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We didn’t know really what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> means, what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> 1s, but we always was thinking, okilly, as soon you go over, a week later comes a telegram you dead, so it’s -- must be more than what anybody knows about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  So, in fact, you wouldn’t really know for sure who told the SS about -- about you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yeah, I know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  It was the disgruntled employee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  It was a -- an employee, I knowed him very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">His name was Novokowski. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">He knowed me well, we got along real good. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I don’t know -- he didn’t meant actually to hurt me, so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He was trying to hurt the widow in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , because he was mad at her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Yes, but the -- the widow, in fact, sounds as if she always was very honorable in her dealings with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, she respect us, she respect our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">She knows how much money we have in -- it’s involved -- what we have over there in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Plus, she felt at this time, you have been a woman, a lady, something, you have not got involved in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">You was involved to raise th -- your family, the three girls, nobody’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  And so she was happy to see that I take over the duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Yes, I wondered if that good relationship was unusual? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I know that there was much anti-Semitism in <span class="REGION">Catholic Poland</span> , but perhaps because they were somewhat part of the intelligentsia, she and her husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Normally, actually, what it is, sure the anti-Semitism was a real great big, big, and every day got bigger actually, the anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">This actually why br -- mine brother left in °33, he saw it -- what is coming, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And he say he doesn’t want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , doesn’t want no part, so he just -- and he was a patriot to build <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , this was the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We thought he is not normal, he goes away from the -- from the good <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he used to say he’s ashamed that we are making money easy, you know, he believe more you have to work for your money, not just from business. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So far -- he was very, very much patriotic, but the -- with me, actually, I didn’t know it, I was over there four weeks in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and then suddenly, about -- after four weeks, I remember, yeah, somebody called my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I recognize right away this was the widow from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , Mrs. Rochinski, and she in Polish calls me, you know, and -- and so if she’s -- and she -- I responded, “Yeah, I am here, in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I don’t know if- where she know it, or apparently she know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And so she told me that she is released, she --after four weeks -- she was four weeks 1n <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and she said she -- they released her, she goes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">She told me that I shouldn’t worry, I will go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They had already the release for me, but they need a signature from a higher officer, and they have to go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for this <span class="BUILDING">high office</span> signature. “</span><span class="sentence" id="321">So you probably will be released tomorrow,” she told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And they all -- the other inmates in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> where was -- I was with them, they all heard it, and everybody was happy for me, I going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And they gave me addresses to go to their families, and their wives, tell them how they are, what they this. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was a -- like a holiday already, the day when she called us. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But the next morning, early in the morning, this what the procedure [indecipherable] in the morning, they called off my name, they called off other inmates name, but I -- something didn’t sound to me right, because they kept on calling too many names. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Because they used to do every few weeks, every month or two -- but I don’t know the same way, exactly how often they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They emptied the <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> for new inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">In other word, they took those <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> , and they send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or whatever, and -- but when they took us, they tied our -- our hand to the back, and -- just with a piece string, like, actually, nothing, and they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they drove, I don’t know how many kilometer -- I never know even til today where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I think -- I assume it was Kelsa, because from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koinsket</span> , biz -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kelsa</span> was not so far, and took about a couple hours in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And then they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> over there on the -- we have been told -- we saw all around SS, with machine guns, rifle gu -- whatever, circled around us, and they kept on bringing to another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , so I don’t know [indecipherable] else, until they get it, a large quantity of people the same way and it -- it must have been several thousand, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Took quite a number of hours, until when we all have been, and you have -- lay on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , on your knees, you could not raise your head, if you raised your head, your -- they told us, then you will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">You know, your -- right away they watched with rifles around over there, or machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Well, we all laid on the -- on the f -- on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> over there on this <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , until actually they had the amount of people, or whate -- what they expected to have it on the <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> , and they put us on cat -- those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> , in the same ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We used to see the one who guarded some of them have been Wehrmarkt, and so we have been more friendlier, because you couldn’t just talk to one from the SS, he finished you on -- off on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But we saw [indecipherable] they ask him where they take us, where we going to go, where we going. “</span><span class="sentence" id="336">Oh,” they used to say, “oh, you go probably where you going to have to | -- be over there, do some work, labor.” [</span><span class="sentence" id="337">indecipherable] all, and we didn’t know it until we arrived around midnight, probably, over there, and the first thing I saw it when they brought in, they opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and it said, the <span class="DLF">gate</span> said abait bakt fry. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I didn’t know that this was a g -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> a <span class="DLF">gate</span> , didn’t know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But as soon we -- we got off in restraints, although it was guarded off -- they have a bi -- large <span class="DLF">ramp</span> -- <span class="DLF">ramp</span> , and both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> have been guarded by SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And they had sticks, irons, all kind things, and when they chase you out, and everything was schnell, schnell, fast, fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And so you got -- wherever you move, wherever you go, it didn’t make any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">They hit you over your head, or your back. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It depends how lucky you have been, and we had to keep on moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And this what we did, and then we saw people, like kapos in uniforms, striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We didn’t know it -- they start to talk, and they said, “Here’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ,” you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And some of them have been only over there from those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> what they -- they want to kill you practically on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Any move, whatever it was, it didn’t make any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was only, you know, to make you so miserable, that you will give up li -- living. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The truth 1s, I gave up right away the first day when I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I figured this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And I could see it right away, wherever I was, that it’s nowhere in the world -- you know, the dreaming that I will go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , see my parents, see my family, or be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">A lot of -- the first thing when I gave up, I figured what’s the use to fight? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">You cannot fight this, and why suffer? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So you -- no use to suffer either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Well, what went wrong, do you suppose, in the plan that your brothers were working toward? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It seems you came so close to being freed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Yeah, this is -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">In fact, Jewish people have not been allowed to visit a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> if they have somebody -- like some other -- if you have been Gentile, you have been allowed, I don’t know, every two weeks, or every -- to see some relatives or friend, but for Jewish people was not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">One time, the warden from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> arranged that my older brother from me I was the youngest, but next to me, his name was Abraham, that he come to see me, he can speak with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I wait, he called me out to come to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , took me out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There I was in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he told me, look, this a -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">This is tape number two, side A.
ANSWER:  And he said he does it, but it’s not legal, 1t’s not allowed for a Jewish person to have any visits [indecipherable], but he says, “Your brother gonna come to this <span class="DLF">window</span> ,” and he hold me over there by the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and he said, “You talk to your brother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I went in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I saw my brother, and he said, “Moshe.” </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And I said, “Avrum.” </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We called each other’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And then the warden, he watched it pretty careful, and he saw through the <span class="DLF">window</span> that a s -- ess -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">SS car</span> coming closer, and he didn’t know where they come, but right away he said, “Back -- quick, back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and I never saw nobody any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Too great a risk for the warden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Yeah, and the next day, this when they called off and they brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And --
QUESTION:  I had wanted to ask, after you were -- you had been moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , would your family have been able to trace where you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  Probably not. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">No way, I mean you -- this was so secretly arranged, that nobody could trace nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">No, this was not -- never -- impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">This I know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And your information about your family after that, were you able to find out anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  I never heard it, and I never met -- I never saw nobody, not s -- ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">In the same way, even when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I saw this is the end of the w- world, and everything, but I never could forget not that I’m suffering -- this was out of the question, I just felt for their suffering, sorry you know, but it didn’t help me much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  So, despite much questioning, I -- I know that you’ve checked whether any Jews had survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chadbush</span> , and there were --
ANSWER:  None.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  -- there were none left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  None. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  So, of your family of six, only your brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> --

<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  -- 1s known to have survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Do you have any other -- any other information at all about members of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  I checked when they had one time -- the Red Cross arranged one time a reunion with other who have been with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And so I had left all names, and all whatever the questions what they gave me to fill out, and for awhile they send me a letter that they have everything, they keep on checking. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Then, maybe six months later, or a year later, they send me another letter, they did their best, but they can never could place it -- any -- any of the names that I requested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">In the years since then, have you ever gone back to that <span class="REGION">area</span> , or ever felt a wish to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  You mean my <span class="BUILDING">birth home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">This was in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Finally, I was -- the last dead march -- I -- I made more than one dead march, that was made in the end of December, between Christmas and New Year. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The first dead march was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yaveeshavitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Then, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> I’d say where I was 1n a subcamp from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , the name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Traylitz</span> , this is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And around early April, or the end of March they say the -- the allied forces start to get closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Well, the first thing, they put us for a recreation, too, they kept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They kept us in two weeks what 1s -- you know, I don’t want go into details, because y -- it -- I will never be able to even finish, even if you stay a whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It was -- I did survive the dead march. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They kept us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , we used to go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I just found out later that they used to, every day, from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> was maybe 10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have been -- our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was on a <span class="DLF">one track line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We didn’t go nowhere, we just went from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and the next day we went back to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And we thought -- we didn’t realize that this is the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we didn’t go nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I have been, for two weeks -- not me only, but all of us who survive what actually -- in a few thousand they started off when they evacuate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">In thousands, the all other been on the -- on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , their bodies was laying because they have been shot, they have been exhausted from walking, whatever, and automatically, if you couldn’t walk, automatically the guard shot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Doesn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But I survived over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So the last thing, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And this was -- the same way, you know, I -- I -- must be early of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And at this time, when I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> actually, I was probably 99 percent point nine dead, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I have very little signs that I’m alive, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And in fact, it was in -- a coincidence that -- even that I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litenritz</span> , one night, when they -- those all who -- who still have been alive, they brought us first the night before -- we have been in I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litenritz</span> , and this was terrible condi -- conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And being two weeks without food, without water, even the little food what we used to get, but without this [indecipherable] it didn’t -- we have not been far away in 100 percent to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And what had happened in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litenritz</span> actually, that they said in the morning they going to serve us coffee, a hot, liquid something, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And over there the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> didn’t had even <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , and laying in mud, you didn’t had no bunkbeds, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">If you laid down for the night to rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But nothing to -- less, and nothing more but in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And this was a terrible things, without everything, but a human, if you have anything, any instinct being a human, you know that this doesn’t go farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I didn’t slept even the whole night, but probably I would have been fall asleep, and waited actually that I’m going to get -- I know it would be a little bit dark, mud, whatever they called it, they called it coffee, but we get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And we used to carry always a can, a rusted can if they found it, if somebody going to give us something, that we have a can to take the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And early in the morning, they called you, coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And I was trying to be from the first, because I know it if I don’t go to the first, I will never reach any more what they gave you. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I was among the first, and they gave me the amount what -- in my rusted coffee, and I just pour it in -- in my body, whatever they gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I -- I don’t know til today what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I just poured it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And took a few hours, and they told us that the guards will come, they will take us to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , we know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> is not actually a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , it’s a model camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We -- we had not been afraid, we cannot go -- we cannot lose now, see, it cannot be worse than it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And we have been happy that finally -- that we will -- we will reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , but not always what you think is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , actually, I didn’t -- I don’t think they even had <span class="DLF">toilets</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I -- I was dehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn’t had it before because I was two weeks without food, without water. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I was fairly dehydrated and I couldn’t get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My friends, what we -- I know them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> still, they came by and they said good news, [indecipherable] you know, we going to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> in the next hour or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I told the one that I know them very well, w-was intimate friendship in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yaveeshavitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">His name was Yankey. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I told him, “Yankila, it’s too late for me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And he said, “In the all suffering what you know what you had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , and everything,” he said -- he said, “don’t make me leave you here.” </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  Yeah -- no, I meant that your -- your childhood would have been spent in different faiths, but you would -- you would ha -- after your marriage, you’ve shared the same faith, and also a -- probably both of you had known some degree of hardship. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Even your wife had experienced the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So probably your values were similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">ANSWER:  She was very cooperative, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">She had feelings, you know, to follow myself, so we never had any complications. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Even we have not been the same faith, in the beginning, but she accepted to follow me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I’m -- I’m asking these questions, too, knowing that a great many of the survivors with experiences something like yours, perhaps for shorter periods, tended to marry survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And that’s really why I’m probing with these questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Yeah, this is true, but like I mentioned, actually, I had bad experience when I had a friend to me what -- she was devoted to me, and this -- and I miss her very much, so this makes a strong friendship, and this why actually I was waiting until she had a chance to come over here, and to share a life together, that we do share, because we have been married in ’52. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">It’s actually 47 years actually are married.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="934">ANSWER:  Unfortunately, my wife was one time pregnant, but we didn’t have the experience, you know, how to be careful, whatever, in the pregnancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">She had a miscarriage, and it upset us both, but in the other hand, it didn’t change our life, either, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I always figured, if something doesn’t go our way, we have to accept it, because we never look- she was trying to get medical help, and everything, but it didn’t succeed, and so finally we gave it up, to take it as it comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I ask that only because I -- I understand some survivors have, because of their suffering, not wanted to have children, and you don’t seem to be one of those people who --
ANSWER:  No, it was not our intention. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We wanted, actually, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">In the beginning, the first years, we couldn’t afford to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We didn’t feel, well 1f we gonna bring in a life, and we have hardship to survive, but we always figured, when the time get better, we save a little bit more, then we start it. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And then we started, and it was too late, or whatever it is, 1t just did not materialize.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Tell me about reli -- what your religion means to you, and do you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> regularly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  About religion, as I mentioned before, I was raised Orthodox, and I always felt in my heart that the Jewish religion is the only practically religion, that you can believe in it, it has a ground to -- to believe in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I -- b-but I respect any religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I respect any person who can hold up his custom, his religion, I respect very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I am right -- no | am not a particular -- I wouldn’t call myself I’m a religious person, but I am very traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">In the past I remember the nice holidays, [indecipherable] and other things, in a clean, nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And I still try, you know, to resume those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And to be honest [indecipherable] I was asked by kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I lecture to them about the Holocaust, and they ask me if I believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">To answer this, it’s very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">In one way, it’s pretty hard to believe, if --
QUESTION:  I interrupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">You were telling me about the children asking do you believe in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">To answer you straight, what -- what the Jewish people -- nation, suffered, it’s actually hard to believe in God, but I take mine whole strength in to believe, and I’m not so highly educated to be able to say that -- to believe, or not to believe, though I acc -- I accept that the easiest thing actually to believe, and continue believing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">QUESTION:  And you followed all the traditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They’re part of your -- of your marriage and your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  More or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">To tell the truth, more or less I follow it, and I enjoy it, but we don’t run constantly to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but on the high holidays, we always attend the Services.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">What about friendships in your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="963">You spoke of different ones during the years when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Have th -- have your friendships been enormously important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  Oh sure, it’s important, actually, when -- I cannot lie, because I don’t have nobody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And so friendship is actually the most what we still have left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I continue to be in friendly terms with old friends [indecipherable] around here. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I feel I’m blessed that we have friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  In the early years --
ANSWER:  Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  Yeah, in -- in the -- in your first years in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , were you -- was your social group very much a group of survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  More or less, yes, but we have a -- a lot of friends, you know, they’re not been survivors, and a lot of Gentile families, what are very nice people, and decent people, and we enjoy very much to spend time with them together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">QUESTION:  I was -- in -- in thinking about how you, I think, managed to -- to endure those years of suffering, of extreme brutality and so on, and yet to come out of it and be able to be a sort of loving, warm person, I’m guessing -- I -- I’d like you to -- to tell me whether you’ve thought about how you were able to do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Was it the -- the upbringing you had? </span><span class="sentence" id="974">The friendships? </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I -- I mean, there must be things that you thought of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">ANSWER:  As far as I know -- it’s a very good question, but for me it’s actually easy to answer it. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">They are up there, I think, my whole family, all brothers and sisters, how we have been raised by our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">My parents, especially my father was very strict in behaving, but I’m really thankful for his -- that he raised us in a strict way, that I can have the -- to understand, and to know the difference between good and bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And we have been raised -- and I think all my brothers know in our family, have been more or less actually, raised the right way, and to respect where we supposed to respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And I feel that I was blessed with a family like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">QUESTION:  I asked that question, too, knowing that many -- many survivors have found it difficult to adjust to -- to life because of how much they suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Others too, have had full and rounded s -- remarkably successful lives, but do you think that you often suffer because of your earlier suffering? </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I was thinking about, does it show up in great anxiety, about your wife, for instance? </span><span class="sentence" id="984">If she’s late coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , do you feel, do you think, more concerned than somebody else might be? </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Are you more anxious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  It’s no doubt any survivor, I don’t care who it is, who had to go through so much humiliation, and suffering, and taking away the dignity from being a human being, if we want it, or we don’t want it, something is missing in us, and -- and I mean not in myself, but in any survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And this can never be fulfilled, even if you are successful in business, and family life, and everything, always will come to haunt you about your past, about your suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">But in other hand, I accept it, the philosophy, if I want it, I don’t want it, I have to go on with my life, either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">If I think too much about my past, and those all good things what I lost, is the only way to bury myself alive, not to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">But the -- so long I keep on continuing with my life, I have to be strong enough to take life and accept life as it comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">QUESTION:  Do you find that in the -- decades ago, in the early years, that you had to deliberately block out those thoughts, and -- and look to your future in order to cope? </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I ask that question because I know that you’ve given interviews like this in latter years, but not -- not earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  The same thing, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">As much that I remember those old horror stories, and they can never be told, but not a human being, I -- but my past from the suffering, but I have always thinking, not of a great deal about future success, but accept life how it comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And I think this holds me going the way how I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">QUESTION:  I wonder if when you and your wife were first together, would you tell her at great length of -- of what had happened during those earlier years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  Yeah, with my wife, I always discussed, and I always used to tell her. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And she was trying to protect me, like for example when it used to come the worst horror stories, and documentary on TV, she was trying, and not succeeded that I shouldn’t watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But for some reason, I tried never to miss nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And to be honest, when people -- strange people, or friends even, who were not -- had those horrible experience from being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I watched them constantly, and -- and most of the time, I don’t know why, this is actually, it’s a sickness, I hardly was moved by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I felt I’m more like a piece metal, a stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">But now in -- nothing ca -- can move me, actually to those old, horrible memories from the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">QUESTION:  Do you think that’s because that’s how you coped then, by -- by -- by becoming numb?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">ANSWER:  I accepted that I cannot choose my life -- things what is coming to what is not coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I lost everything, the best and the dearest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And then I actually made up my mind, and realized that this is only a way not to complain, and not to think too much about it, but you cannot forget, but to keep on going, as long as possible with my life I had, and take it as 1t comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">QUESTION:  Have you, in your -- your 50 years now in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , are there been -- are there particular causes, and interests that you’ve had? </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">You’ve told me how you supported the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , that would be more recently, but are there other political or social things that are dear to your heart?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  No, no, it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">No, this was impossible, and in fact, even I worked in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , we have been with Poles, Gentiles, together always, but it was not allowed, apparently, and never had a chance even to hear news, or even to look in a piece -- a newspaper piece, or even what it was months or years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">No, we never knowed much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">We know it only -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we used to have feelings, if they treated us bad, beatings, or really torturing, well, we felt this a good things, that they have losses on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">This -- this was our policy, you know, to know what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">When they have been nice to us, we felt they have too many successes on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">We like rather to suffer, and to be humiliated by the guards, and beaten by the guards, kicked by the guards; then we had hope that maybe a change can be soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">But we never expect to be free people, or be in -- humans any more, anyway, but this gave us some hope that eventually, sometimes, that maybe will be a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">You never figure that I will be the survivor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">QUESTION:  Was there any basis, though, for your accepting that when you were suffering, things must be going badly?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">ANSWER:  In 1945, [indecipherable] liberated, 1f anybody who could walk, or move around, whatever, the only thing what we as -- as survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , we only thought about, you know, how to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And another that you -- you are able, if you feel hungry, that you can slice a slice of bread, and eat as much as you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Otherwise the whole world didn’t exist yet, and our -- we still have been numb like you mentioned it, numbness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">We have been numb, we didn’t come to realization that we survived, and we are humans, and we had to go on as a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">No, we never had anything else to think, only about hunger was about all.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">ANSWER:  It -- it’s not a pleasant things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">We used to get a ration of bread, where we used to discuss with each other, what -- how is the best thing to digest the ration? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">To eat up, and make you feel that you satisfied your hunger, or take a bite now, and save it, and take a bite later? </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">This -- we always have discussion what is the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">But a lot of times we realized if you don’t eat it up, you never know somebody will steal from your pocket, or when you go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> you have been hiding, somebody steal away, so you didn’t -- never satisfied, y -- and you don’t -- cannot expect to get a ra -- other things, actually, wherein normally, 99 percent -- I was among those 99 percent, when we got a ration, we had a chance, we ate what we got, and we didn’t had no worries to save it, to keep it in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or whatever.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER:  Not about fancy food, never had any fantasies, we just had fantasies how to satisfy the hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Not suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Now, I wonder to what extent you’ve been left with a hatred of any waste in food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  Yes, still today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I cannot see waste of food whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I myself, where we live we have extra <span class="REGION">acreage</span> , and | have a -- a large <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and I have the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , thanks God, not for income, whatever, I can afford buy seeds, or whatever labor it’s involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">It costs me money, and whenever I have to harvest, I just hated to see that anything goes to waste, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , cause a lot of times, 1f nobody comes to pick up some vegetables from the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , I will go out of my way, and even travel hundred miles around trip, to give some friends from the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">This hurt me, to see food go to waste hurt me very, very much, and this will never change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  And y-your <span class="REGION">land</span> , perhaps, has that extra meaning for you, as a kind of security?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">ANSWER:  Not only about security very much, the <span class="REGION">land</span> means for me actually that since I retired -- I’m already 10 years retired, that I don’t sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , just keep on resting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I always loved to work, and physical work even when it’s hard for me to be more physical, I still love it, and I do it, and I think this keeps me alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1101">QUESTION:  You know, there’s a pattern too, of your surviving in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , of you’re always, perhaps being helped to survive by the fact that you could work and work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">ANSWER:  Actually, some work even in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , their heaviest work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">This is like being a human, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">If you see you accomplish, even for your biggest enemy, it give you satisfactory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">If you could accomplish -- if you have been able to do it, where actually, if you work, the satisfactory is larger than the hard work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">QUESTION:  And do you think that -- I wonder if you have health problems today because of the- all that heavy labor, or has that -- or is that the reason that you’re in such good health?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">ANSWER:  This is a very hard to answer, but one thing actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">When I was liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , this was probably the end of April, or beginning of May, in *45, and I was so sick and ill actually, what I never expect to be alive, and I never saw a doctor, whatever, to check me if I’m healthy or I’m sick, until I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> where they accepted me in a <span class="BUILDING">sanitortum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">This was the first time a doctor examined me and check whatever they -- the <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> over there, the management, they strictly took in only DP’s, Displaced Persons who had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And they treated us -- royalty is maybe the proper word to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And the first medical doctor, he examined me, and he examined me, he told me that I have an enlarged heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Even without knowing any medical terms, or whatever, I don’t know, I just happened to be that I asked this doctor, “Will this stay with me forever?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And he said in medical terms, it’s hard to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Sometime, if you live a normal life, it goes back to normality, it will disappear, and a lot of times it’s will stay with you your whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So far, thanks God, I felt if I worked physical, it helps me to stay alive, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So I continually -- my doctor told me that fairly I’m in good shape, and whatever you do, he told me not to change the formula, keep on doing the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And well, I’m doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  How would you get news today of world affairs and so on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Do you follow particularly carefully, or are you not interested in papers, TV news, radio news?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">ANSWER:  I’m interested, and I follow it, but I know not me even, because popular people, what know the politics and everything, it’s politics, to be honest, personally, I think it’s a dirty trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Nobody’s honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Very rarely you can find somebody who tells you the truth, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">This how I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And in the other hand, as a little, ordinary person, you cannot change those things, either, so you just let them go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  I -- I wondered, you know, wh-what -- what your attitude was, because you can argue the opposite viewpoint, and say that what happened in the 1930’s was because -- I think you can argue this -- was because the people who should have been involved in politics were standing by and allowing the, you know, things to change, and --
ANSWER:  We showed you actually, that the -- not people, but <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and I hate to criticize the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did a great deal for me, whatever, and -- and I -- I feel that I try my best to be a good citizen, actually, but on the other hand, you read about the past, and you call it a world of civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">In the whole world -- I don’t want to mention name, but this is including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , where I’m a citizen, and I try to be a honest, good citizen, that the whole world could stand by and see those horror, brutalities -- I don’t have the proper word to mention about it, and I don’t think the dictionary has even the proper words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And I don’t think you can express the proper words to -- to express about those past, and doing nothing, this actually, you lose the belief in any civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">There’s a part of me, it’s hard for me to believe that a civilized world exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">QUESTION:  Do you find it -- do you find it hard in relationships with people to trust them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Do you think you’re -- you’re different? </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I’ve known no suffering, and that trust -- trusting other human beings might be easier for me, or whether, in fact, you’re just the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">ANSWER:  To me, actually, you know, trusting or not trusting, it’s har -- very hard to trust people in general, but you feel more trusted when you come along to a Holocaust survivors, what they had the same experience as me, and then I realize they understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">But a average person, if you’re Jewish or Gentile, 1t doesn’t make any different to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But I realize right now, after 50 years, being more or less a normal person, that it’s hard to believe that it was so much suffering for those people who have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And -- and even somebody would say, you know, it never existed, it’s just a hoax. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">A lot of times I -- I feel I’m not mad about it, but I feel as a normal person, with normal thinking, you have to believe it’s a hoax, it’s not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">QUESTION:  Because it’s unbelievable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">ANSWER:  Th -- th -- exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1139">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">ANSWER:  It’s unbelievable, I mean, this is the proper word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">A lot of times I will in po -- in ger- in English, and hard to express me the proper words, but like you said, it’s unbelievable, in the same way, with as much as you talk, or videos you interview, but the true story will never come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And I hope that we never come to a point where the true stories of new sufferings comes.</span></p>
