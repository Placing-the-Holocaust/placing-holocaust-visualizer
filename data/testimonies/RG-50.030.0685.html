<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  But I also remember, now that you’ve jogged my memory, that I went to pre- school or <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , first grade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> , and we had to draw red stars and — and you know, Stalin’s picture and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So that obviously was during the Russian occupation, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  So we were there already during that — the Russian occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Do you remember where you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> , what it looked like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yes, I— I—Ido, because, course we lived there until 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  And it was in Tilto Gatvé number 12, which is, know, a block or so, couple of blocks from the <span class="DLF">Cathedral Square</span> , the center. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">February 18, 2013
QUESTION:  It’s the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and it was one of those things typical of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This was not in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was in the — what’s called the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which is probably 200 years old anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And it has a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and it looked like an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and you walk in through a little <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and there’s a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And so, our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we walked through the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , up some <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , and — but our <span class="DLF">windows</span> were out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Ah, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gediminas</span> or to <span class="DLF">Tilto Street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER: <span class="DLF"> Tilto Street</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Uh-huh, so that’s a small <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Yeah, it’s —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  And it had a lot of great little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , most of which are gone now, but they were still there when we were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  You — you say that you remember seeing the German soldiers marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">February 18, 2013
ANSWER:  Well, I don’t think it was marching, I guess there were just — there was a parade, I guess, aft-after they do — marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But I don’t remember them marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I do remember when the war began, I was walking down <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tilto Gatvé</span> , and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from somewhere with my mother, and we heard like a muffled explosion somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I guess that was a German bomb being dropped somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But there weren’t too many of them, they didn’t, you know, mash up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But then the Polish woman, remember running by yelling, paniczka(ph), paniczka(ph), wojna, which, you know —
QUESTION:  And what does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  That means, paniczka(ph) means like lady, lady, it-it’s war, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  And so that — that’s what it sounded, but I don’t remember — there were no acts of war in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The Germans just, you know, moved in and that the extent of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of how the atmosphere in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> changed? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Did your parents look nervous, did they seem —
ANSWER:  Well, I mean, everybody was nervous throughout this whole period. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I do remember that there was a lot of social activity, that they would go together, you know, and have parties, and you know, talk and why my — my father never used to February 18, 2013 smoke, well then he started smoking with his friends, because they were — they were always nervous and not certain of what — what was going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  And his job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> had been — can you tell us a little bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well, he was — like I said that — at — at — at first he was ins-inspector of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , where he would go inspect and file reports on various <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that he was — somebody who I guess oversaw the hiring and promotion of teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And then at a va — at the la — last position he had, he was a director or deputy director for special and vocational education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  I guess the reason why I come back to this is that during the first Soviet occupation, teachers were particularly targeted for deportation by the Soviets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  And so I’m surprised that they weren’t on this — that they weren’t targeted 1n this way, that he continued having some sort of job in the educational sphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yeah, I — and in fact, he — he took advantage of — of, I guess the Soviet occupation to move into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> because before that it was Polish, and there was no such possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But I guess a lot of opportunities for people to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> became available just before or during the Soviet occupa — first Soviet occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">February 18, 2013
QUESTION:  Well, I realize that the period of time that we’re talking about with you, really will start from 1941 til 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And at that time you were between six and 10 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Well, nine to —
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Nine, 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So how — do you remember ho-how life changed? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I mean, you saw — you had an image of — of German soldiers marching in a parade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you have an image and a memory of a Polish lady ran — running and — and saying —
ANSWER:  Yeah, the war is —
QUESTION:  — the war is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">What were some of the other images, some of the other fragments of memories that you have from the very first days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Well, the first — it’s hard to say because na — we lived in this little <span class="DLF">street</span> , away from — only about a block away from a main <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  But as far as a — a four or five year old, six year old child is concerned, it might be la— two miles away, because you’d never get out there anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So, I didn’t see very much of — I do remember, before the Germans came of — I was walking again with the — well, we — either my mother or my ma — her mother, my grandmother would take me for walks, you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> , and before the Russians left, I saw February 18, 2013 some — right around <span class="DLF">Cathedral Square</span> , there — there — there were a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> passed with — loaded with people and with Russian soldiers with bayonets standing in the corners of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I later found out those were the people who were being deported to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Did you ever walk — remember walking around in the real old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which would have been the Jewish quarter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes, we — we do that all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My grandmother would take me to the old <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , she was a devout Catholic and she would go — I remember there was — I think it was the <span class="BUILDING">Dominican church</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">stairway</span> that the supplicants walked up underneath.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  And they had little relics of saints’ blood or something like that and that they kissed it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I remembered that — her doing that, and in fact I — I was able to see that at one of our visits, you know, I-lately, about, you know, five, six years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They’re rebuilding the whole thing and I actually got to see the same <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , only now it looked a lot smaller than it did before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Did you notice — I mean, since many of the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> were interspersed with where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was, where the narrow <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were, where there were Jewish peddlers in <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Did you notice these things? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Did you notice February 18, 2013 any part of the Jewish life that was going around? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">You were a child, of course, but was that something that —
ANSWER:  No, I—I don’t specifically recall, you know, seeing the — the — the Jewish life or the peddlers or the — the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I— I—I guess we didn’t go into that <span class="REGION">section</span> very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We went, I guess, near the <span class="DLF">Cathedral Square</span> and the wa — or the Saint Anne’s church and the <span class="BUILDING">Dominican church</span> was in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Did you know of anything, even at that young age, that there are people who are Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Did your parents talk about anything like that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t recall we were specifically talking about that, until later, when the Holocaust started and I remember once my father saying to the Germans, we’re offering, you know, for those who collaborate, you know, with them, offering the chance to be the first ones into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> of the Jews that they — that they deport to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  So he mentioned that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yes, and apparently some people were taking it, you know, cause otherwise they wouldn’t be talking about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But my father was as — as poor as a church mouse, but he never do — did anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  What a — did you ever see any Jews when you were a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">February 18, 2013
ANSWER:  I must have, but I— I just don’t have a recollection of wha — of what they looked like, except for one incident which does stick in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Tell us about that incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And this was something that has really etched in my memory, because I do — I don’t remember very much from that time period, but this one of our walks in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And I guess we were walking somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Who were you with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Who were you with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  With my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  And whether I’m — and we were walking down some <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and at this time I guess the Jewish people were still not locked up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but they had to wear a yellow Star of David on — on their clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And at that — by this time they could not — they were not allowed by the Germans to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , they had to walk in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we were walking along and I saw this German soldier run up to this elderly lady with a gi — with a yellow star on her clothing, and strike her with the — with his rifle butt. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And it turns out like wi — he was doing it because she was walking on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I remember very clearly I—I-—I- February 18, 2013 it’s not something that you see all the time, and my mother getting very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">She started to yell at that soldier, you know, how can you be doing this to an old lady, and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And so that’s something that I — a-an act, or a— a—a real act of violence against a Jewish person, and by — apparently it was some kind of a guard that walking around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , taking care of, insuring that nobody was walking on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> when they’re not supposed to, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Did he turn on your mother, did he pay attention to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  What did he do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Well, I—I just stay with her, I asked here what’s going on, and this — she said that these people are like beasts, you know, the — who would be doing that, you know, to defenseless old people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  But did the guard hear your mother and then turn his attention to her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  No, he didn’t, he just said something in German, probably something that’s like stay out of it or something, but I didn’t understand it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But he didn’t do anything to my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Did you walk on afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">February 18, 2013
QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And did your — did any explanation or further conversation about this happen at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Well, I—I-—I suppose there was, but I don’t recall, you know, what happened at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The — my mother probably told my father what was going on and they talked about it, but I don’t have that — that recollection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What — did your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> change after the German occupation on <span class="DLF">Tilto Street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Well, we don’t — we didn’t — our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , you know, the people who lived in that — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> facing that <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> probably were the same people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The only thing that I learned later, th — much later, while my mother was still alive here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , is that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the middle of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> — it was a couple of — series of small <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> within the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , which were quite old and I think they’re designated as historical monuments now. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Anyway, she told me that during the Holocaust, during the shooting of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paneriai</span> , those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were used to — to store — to — to — I guess to — to house some of the shooters. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And — and she said that you know, every morning they would take them out there you know, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And then in the — in the evening they would — they would bring them back, and they all would, you know, stumble and fall out February 18, 2013 of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> completely drunk, with bottles of vodka 1n their — 1n their hands, and apparently that —
QUESTION:  And the neighbors —
ANSWER:  — that’s — that’s who they were, they — they — apparently th-these were people that, I think they were called the — the Ypatingas Burys, a special, you know, troop who did the shooting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  And where they got was people, and they were all young hooligans, hoods —
QUESTION:  Were they German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  No, they — they were Polish and Lithuanian and they were local — they were local people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> who obviously were doing it to be able to get their hands on all the vodka that they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And they would start drinking in the morning and — and — and not — and not finish until they were passed out at night, I’m guess that’s — that’s how they did it, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Did your mother — did you have conversations — now this takes place in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when you’re already older and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Did you have more extensive conversations with her about these things, about these topics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  Well she — she didn’t like to talk about that very much, but of course she was very much aware of what was going on there and — but I don’t know if she really February 18, 2013 knew exactly what was going on there because this was not something like a public record, but of course everybody knew what was happening to the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  But I mean later, after the war, when you said that when you were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , she mentions this — this incident, that these are the soldiers and they were in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">At that time, was there more conversation? </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You were already in the west, you were already — you know, it was safe and — and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Was there more conversation about such things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Well she — she was always very — a humane person. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And it’s obvious that it was difficult for her to talk about something as — as hag — ghastly as that, you know, where — where you know, mass killing was — was carried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And she — she was, of course were very condemning of the — of the g-guys who were — the drunks who were shooting there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But other than that, oh there was — a-and — course th-the — the whole drift was that we don’t have anything to do with them, these are just extremely, you know, bad people, they were the — should stay away from them, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  As the war progresses, you get older, you know —
ANSWER:  Uh-huh
QUESTION:  — you — your grow — and so by 1944 you are how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  ’44, I was nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">February 18, 2013
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  This was in December — in December we — we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> and then <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in December of ’44, when the front was advancing toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">What were the rest of the war years like? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Was there any other interaction with Germans that you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Did you ever pass the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by whe — after it was established?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  I don’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We might have, but I don’t think anybody wanted to go near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off with <span class="DLF">gates</span> , and people just didn’t want to get in — near that whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I do remember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I guess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian — Lithuanians to establish a—a SS regiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked were shipped off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , and you know, some of them died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And so I remember that for — for weeks, my father and — and his other colleagues, you know, switched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily found if — if — cause usually when they come to arrest you they come — they don’t go to your <span class="BUILDING">place of work</span> , they — they come to — when you’re sleeping in your — in February 18, 2013 your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So they — they were — well, you know, scared of getting shipped off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and so they — they did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And so that was, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of — of the German occupation with. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  Are there — are there any other memories, fragments of memories from that time, about the war, about the occupation, about perhaps conversations that were had about these things, that — that you can recall, when you were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t think that our parents, and of course nobody else talked to children about what they knew what was — that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Now of course, they all knew what was going on, but they were not sharing this with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Of course, I think that my mother was always, you know, aghast that this was going on, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And my father, you know, our — this was a time when there were epidemics now going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There was a typh — typhus epidemic which my sister and I spent a few weeks, you know, trying to — to get to — Deet. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And I remember that, you know, before — before the, I guess <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and — and the destruction of the Jews, our family doctors were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Dr. Gehrler(ph) and doctor — I du — don’t remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And I think that — and then toward the end, I guess, they weren’t — they weren’t there any more, so that was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">February 18, 2013
QUESTION:  Did you have any memories of who th — of these individuals? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Do you remember th — how they looked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  I faintly remember how Dr. Gehrler(ph) looked, because he would come and take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But I don’t — don’t know anything else about him or what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He obviously wound up at some — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paneriai</span> or whatever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">When did your own interest 1n — in these events that people were so silent about, when did it start to appear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter — the na — the international press and — and some books about the Holocaust, and — and the — the — the destruction of the Jewish population of <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And of course you would — could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian press here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because that was like a taboo topic, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Why do you think it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Well, I think many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who controlled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They did not want to mention it or to — to — to — to even, you know, mention it in the — in their papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Now of course, there were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you February 18, 2013 know, some nonsense that the Jews are — are spreading, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But that — that, I think, was the minority, most of them just didn’t want to, you know, hear about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  But why would they have a feeling of shame?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Because they knew that there was some — obviously they knew that there was some involvement by — by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Because when you look at — at — I-I started researching this thing on my own a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">As soon as I got my degree and started working and se — then started reading books. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And when the computers came out, I w — I went to the web pages of the various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know, find out what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And after — and — <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> became independent again in ’91, there was — there were publications by the — the history, a kind of, I guess history department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took place in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I was amazed to see that the whole map of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was covered with these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , which also mentioned a number that were executed in each <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  And — February 18, 2013
QUESTION:  It’s a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And so it dawned on me then that this not something that could have been done by, you know, couple of hundred of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I mean, they had to — somebody had to round up the Jews in each one of these <span class="REGION">localities</span> , drive them — march them to the <span class="DLF">graveside</span> , and then whoever shot them, shot them, but the — the shooters themselves did not do this, obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of that — of the provincial police forces, who were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And obviously this is the case, an-and I’ve been trying to find out who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And in fact, I’m reading a book now by — just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD, Sutton, I think was it —
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Sutton, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police chiefs of the <span class="REGION">Lithuanian provinces</span> sitting, a nice picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And of course I— I —I—1t doesn’t take much — I don’t have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking about there, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Why is this important to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">February 18, 2013
ANSWER:  Because I am Lithuanian, I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">What happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> is important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I want to know the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I mean, it’s — 1t’s — it’s kind of hard to take to — to talk about the people who — who are, you know, accomplices in something of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But if that happened, I want to know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I want to know who these people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Where th — where the — are th-they now. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Most of them are dead, but, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Do you think that that curiosity, that need to know — it’s more than curiosity, do you think that’s shared by many people in the Lithuanian community, whether it’s here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I think a lot of them take the attitude that oh, this happened, you know, 60 years ago, forget about it, you know, it’s gone, let’s just go on with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They don’t care what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Would you — why sh — do you — I mean, this is a leading question, but, why should they care?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Well, any human being should be concerned about a — a — some — something that happened in which millions of innocent people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And so I don’t think anybody can just shake their head and — and forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Unfortunately, th-things like that haven’t stopped happening since then, your — you look at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Srebrenica</span> , and look at <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I mean, genocide, that goes on even now. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And February 18, 2013 I think people have to be aware of this an-and try to stop it, be at — learn from mistakes that were made, or — or they weren’t mistakes, it’s just a misplacement of — of priorities —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  — where the National Socialist Order simplistic solutions to — to complicated problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Okay, you don’t like the Jews, the Jews you think are doing something against your, you know, countrymen. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So, of course, you kill them all, that’s the best way to get to redress the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And this is exactly what they were doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and — and in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that, and that should be something that people would no longer think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Thank you very much for sharing both your memories, and your thoughts, and your interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I appreciate it.</span></p>
