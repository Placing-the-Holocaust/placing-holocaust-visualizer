<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So you were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> overnight and then into the morning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  That’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So we were staying in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and some people had to make their business right where they were sitting, they just couldn’t hold it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So then in the morning after about nine, ten o’clock, it was in the morning we find out we came to and that time, I never was there before, and so they took us out there and put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and made it real crowded in there so there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Either they want to save the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , not have too many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Whatever it was, it was a cruelty thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We still couldn’t go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , some people had to clear out one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and we let them all go in that one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and after then we stopped at a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The <span class="BUILDING">station</span> which we didn’t know the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , I don’t think so, somebody knows ,we didn’t know at that time where we was. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We went out of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , we were allowed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">restrooms</span> at that time and we find out this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Right outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> we just took all our clothes off, we had to get the clothes which they use in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , the striped clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was not built up completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It didn’t have nothing to do for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  So it was still in the process of being built?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  In the build up, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So what actually happened, they took, they give us some bags you know where you fill 1t with straw so you can sleep on it, make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Everybody has to fill it themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was everything new. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was for us, it doesn’t look too bad, it didn’t look at that time like, we didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We saw something it was built. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So they took us a whole bunch of the old Jews together there. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was not too many at that time there and they brought up to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they have in the <span class="DLF">street</span> some rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">A pile of rocks lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So the SS man said everybody take one rock and march that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">O.K. so everybody took one rock, some were small, some were big and we took the rock, 1t was not very heavy, we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> about a mile and then they said O.K., now put the rocks on that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and make a pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So 4 we put the rocks on that, we go to another <span class="DLF">pile</span> , pick up another rock and put it on the pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They had nothing to do for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  This job was just to keep you busy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Just to keep us busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">O.K. so anyhow that was the beginning there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">After we built up more <span class="DLF">blocks</span> there and I was in one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I think it was 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Were more and more people coming 1n after you arrived? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Were you one of the first people to arrive there, were there people there already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , at that time, everybody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Communists, homosexuals, religious people, big owners from big <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Everybody came in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We had our yellow star, the criminals had their green star, the homosexuals had an orange star, you know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Everybody had a different star. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">That was the way they were identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Anyhow, there wasn’t very much to do to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We had an SS man and the SS man said, O.K. The SS man took us behind the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , he make us some kind of contest of running. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He built two columns, one of the columns was A one of the columns was B and we had to see which column can run faster the distance which he is giving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">That was actually the business at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Then we were all finished, then he teached us some songs, we had to run around. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was all no punishment there, it was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in the build-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And all night we all had stars on the jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There was a <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> , in this <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> we still could buy something if somebody had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So some of the people, we went down, we buy something then they discontinued that, we couldn’t do anymore and I had a bright new jacket, I didn’t have my star on it yet, so the people said, well you have a brand new jacket you can go in the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> for us to buy something. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So I went for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I took the chance and bought something for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That went up to July 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  So you were there for about three months? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">A; From April to July. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Then we get the order one day in the morning you all get up take your good jackets and everything out we give you some other things to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You are going to be going away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We came again on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">This time it was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , this time it was a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
