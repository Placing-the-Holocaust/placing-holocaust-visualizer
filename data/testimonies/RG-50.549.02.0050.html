ANSWER:  My mother, my older brother, and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My father had already died. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My grandparents, who had immigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my uncle, who had immigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 30’s, were hiding in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but we did not know where they were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">There was a little bit of contact between them and us, through a third party, who supplied us with ident -- false identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So -- But we really didn’t know where they wer -- we didn’t know where anybody was, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We didn’t know that my uncle and aunt, and their little daughter had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and then were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My uncle went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , we didn’t know where anybody was. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I mean, we only found that out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So that was really my immediate family, my mother, my brother, and I, and my mother didn’t want to be separated from her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My brother, at the beginning of the war in 1940, was 14, and I was 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, anything else that you would like to know about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Well, during that time, how much information could you get when you were -- when you were in hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I mean, did you have any sense of what was going on either in the world, or how dangerous it was for you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I found out later that -- I wasn’t aware, I was kind of numb during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I found out later that my brother would go in one -- 1n the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> of the -- of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and apparently the neighbors had a new radio, and they were listening to -- illegally to -- it was called ra -- Radio Oranga, Radio Orange [indecipherable] was -- 1t came from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and he knew -- he -- he would listen very carefully what they had to say, what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He did hear a little bit what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We knew that the invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , for instance, we were very happy, because we thought we would be liberated quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And we knew that they -- all they had -- all -- came all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> , I mean <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and -- I mean, we -- we heard some stuff, but we didn’t know really the -- the -- the -- the -- the scale of the -- of the war, and the destruction of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We would hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming over, going -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English planes</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to bomb [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We -- I was really pretty numb, that’s really what it was, so I was -- I Just was kind of waiting for it to be over, and took a long, long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">You have nothing to do, [indecipherable] happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Nothing to do, so days were very long, and nothing happened, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Was that one of the hardest, the boredom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  No, th-the -- the hardest thing was really the fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Boredom was -- somehow you -- you know, as a g -- as a girl I would -- could -- if there was some food, we could peel potatoes, I could knit, I could read. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We were keenly aware that we were very much in the way, that we endangered the people we were hiding with, that there was not enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That we had -- somehow there was a terribly -- disturbance in the family, that my hiding mother was extremely anxious, that my hiding father was the one who wanted this, who did this, with all his heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So we -- we -- we kind of picked up constantly these -- these -- these cues, I would say, from everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The children were angry, the little ones were -- the young ones in -- in that family were not -- you know, they -- they couldn’t play the way they would play before, or talk, because they had to keep this a secret that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">A family would visit, we had to quickly go upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , and then be very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So it was a very tense situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I -- Boredom was -- I would almost say secondary [indecipherable] you know, it was -- it was really the fear that any of us would do the wrong thing, and then it would leak out that we were hiding there, and then we would be sh -- sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and al -- and of course, my hiding father would be also picked up and sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We didn’t quite know that, but we knew it was extremely dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  You often mentioned in the videotaped interview about Walter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Walter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Walter, Walter Verhane -- see, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , that -- the -- the young man, who between 16, and whatever, older, 26 or so, were sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , to the -- they had to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> , yes, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And he was -- he was the one who was called up to go to one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He decided to go and not to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And luckily he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That was one of the most horrendous things for us, because we knew -- we always suspected he had gone there because we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and that he really couldn’t go into hiding, because, well, we needed to find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they would be looking for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And after the war, we -- we always heard that he suffered terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was very difficult to think about, always, that he went there because of us, and I never realized how long he was there, he was there from 1943 to ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I thought he was there maybe for a half year. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So many, many years are -- many, many decades after the war, I wrote him a letter, and asked him exactly why he had decided to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and then he wrote back that he -- it was adventurous -- an adventure for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I don’t know if he was completely truthful. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He was a very religious man and he believed that he -- that he would be saved, that he would not get hurt or killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He had a terrible time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He was -- He was imprisoned there, I found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I -- I mean, I -- I- I probably heard this all in 1945, but somehow I pushed it away, and he -- I found out later that he had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and then he said something that -- against the German nation, and somebody revealed that to -- I don't know to whom, and he was eventually taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Did you -- So, did you continue a correspondence with him [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah, well, I go regularly to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I mean, regularly every three years, four years, five years, and we always meet up. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he has done -- which is very interesting, he has made contact with other people who were in there, in [indecipherable] were in the same <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , in the same workcamp, and they have a reunion, so they have done quite, you know, similar thing what we have done, kind of come out, and talked to others who were in the same situation, and he even wrote about it, and I have his -- his story. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So --
QUESTION:  What was the name of his story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I re -- can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I [indecipherable] can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I don’t know if he gave it a name yet, or -- but, you know, it’s just a personal memoir.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  So what was the relationship like between your family and your hiding family? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was [inaudible]
ANSWER:  During the time, it was very -- it -- very tense at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">After the war, we would -- we still -- we always go there, although my -- my hiding parents are dead now, but I -- when I’m in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I always visit with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My brother always sends them -- he’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> - he sends, around Christmas [indecipherable] he sends oranges, or -- or grapefruits from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We call at Christmas, and we call at birthday, to the er -- just the oldest d- daughter, not all -- not all seven of them, but one or two are -- have -- one -- one of the sons 1S very angry with us, because they thought that my mother was very rich, that she had a lot of money, and that she didn’t give enough money for our hiding to her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My mother was very poor, she was a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The -- The other childs, that’s the one, two, three, fourth oldest, and there is another one who also doesn’t feel so comfortable because they think that, you know, he -- we should have given more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We didn’t -- My mother didn’t have money, and they were paid very little through the underground, or through my uncle, who was -- he was -- as a fact, he was in hiding in -- in -- 1n the east of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I think they sent like, only some money, cause he owned a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">With the others, it’s -- it’s -- it’s a pretty good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We always have to be thankful for them because we -- now the children, you know, they -- they are aware that they suffered, too, while we were in hiding there, and the interesting thing is this happened very recently, I got -- for our 50" anniv -- wedding anniversary, we got a letter from the third oldest child, who is really -- I would almost say obsessed with the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He reads everything, he talks second World War, and -- all the time, and he now has written -- he wanted us to read this during our party, but we didn’t because we had to translate this, and it wasn’t quite appropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But in the -- in this particular letter that he -- was sent the 10 of May, which was kind of interesting, this -- the war started in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , 10“ of May of 1999, he sent this letter, and there was a paragraph in there which said that the children of rescuers were not recognized, especially not in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And it just so happened that I know a psychologist in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , who had just written a book about the -- the selection, and dislocation of the children of rescuers. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, what I did, I put them in contact with each other, so that this man, who is in his 70’s now, not well, can talk to this woman who just wrote the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">She is -- Her name is Luma Abbas-Amden, she’s a psychologist, she has written quite a few books about rescuers. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">She was in hiding herself, was found, and went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so she has -- she is very, very, very familiar with -- with subject, has done quite a bit of resear -- research. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So, I hope it will help this particular man, Donald Prafana is his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Maybe if he speaks to this Luma Abbas-Amden, maybe he gets a little bit of validation, and a little bit of relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So that’s kind of right now my relationship with -- actually the -- only now with the children of my rescue family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Let’s -- I guess let’s -- let’s go on to after the -- after the war, after liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  After liberation, that was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We -- We had to leave there, but we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, we were 1n hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , and we were -- returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So my mother found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to stay with a -- actually, it was the hiding family of a great aunt of mine, who was an ice skater, I can’t remember for how long, until she found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , you know, she was given an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I -- I can’t tell you how long, or -- how long I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The -- The only thing I remember that, it was a very strange family, and that for the first time, I saw somebody who used opium. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Th--Th- The father in that -- in that <span class="BUILDING">household</span> [indecipherable] can’t tell you, it’s the only thing I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He was addicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That was like in May, June, of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My mother found it very necessary that I would go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my brother went -- they tried to find work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He didn’t want to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He went and -- He went on hashava [indecipherable] from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don’t know exactly what the dates were when he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So my mother and I lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was -- she had gotten <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a very bad <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , and eventually we moved to a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I went -- My mother felt that it was necessary that I would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with girls my age, 16 or 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So I went -- She got me -- and this is remarkable -- she got me into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for home economics, which was kind of an -- kind of after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> you went there, and at night I went to <span class="BUILDING">evening high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then we found the Zionist organization, and that’s what we did in our free time, and that’s where we found back -- actually we didn’t find back, we found other people that were in hiding that came back -- back from -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I didn’t find back my friends, my old friends from before the war, except one. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So that was really my life after -- after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My mother tried to make a living, didn’t succeed very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She didn’t have specific skills, she was -- I think she was selling some perfume, and stuff to <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and then eventually she found a job as a manager in a clothing -- in <span class="BUILDING">clothing stores</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Was everyone at that time trying to -- just go back to normal life? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I mean, did -- did -- did it -- you know, like it could possibly be like [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  We tried desperately to go back to normal life, but it was very difficult, because all around us, everything was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You know, you always be -- you -- you know, just me going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for home economics with girls who had gone [indecipherable] to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I didn’t fit in, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">In the <span class="BUILDING">evening school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">evening high school</span> , I didn’t fit in either. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, it was kind of an -- we tried desperately to kind of live a normal life, but I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , we couldn’t really do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There were too many -- it -- it- it was just so -- 1t was such a destruction of the Jews that w-we constantly were reminded of it, even if you don’t want just to really face it on, [indecipherable] see it, but we were constantly reminded of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my uncle, and my aunt, and my -- my cousins were -- were killed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, I didn’t have family. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My -- Luckily, my grandparents, and my uncles also survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They were just caught maybe two days before the liberation, and they didn’t know what to do with two old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And my uncle, they put him in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and then the Germans left, and so my -- then -- then they were freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But it was just at the last moment that they were caught, and -- and like I said, the Germans didn’t quite know what to do with them because the war was almost over. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I- It -- What I remember, the best part of our lives was then the Zionist organization where we all came together with those who survived, and had weekends of -- you know, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- like studying, and we danced, and we sang, and we talked every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We all wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">My brother was called up to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , because that’s -- in 1946, they were going to fight to keep <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> at that time, the Dutch East Indies independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And the Jewish -- many of the Jewish survivors, young men, didn’t go, and they went on illegal alleyah to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And my -- So my brother left -- I guess 1t was in 19 -- maybe 1946, or so -- earlier than that, to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , and -- and then went, I don’t know, maybe stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The whole trip was like three months, and then he went on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and he was -- he was on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that [indecipherable] was caught, but went all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and went into an -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He didn’t go -- The next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So he has been, since 1946 [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So -- So my mother and I were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I met Ed in the -- in Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He left in -- Yeah, go ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Actually, in the early -- in the early 80 -- actually, probably late 70’s, or early 80’s, I become more aware that I was different, that I had been in hiding, and there must be a lot of people who were in h -- had been in hiding, right around here, but I couldn’t get to them, and since I was a social worker, and was a group -- also a group worker, I said, I -- I should maybe get this support group together. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And what I did was I called the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span> , and I knew that other Dutch Jewish immigrants were in -- had been registered there. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And so -- And luckily, the woman I spoke to was a social worker, so she knew what I was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I ask her if I could send -- if she would send a letter from me to people she knew who had been in the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , Jewish people who had been in war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and if they would then contact me, maybe we could meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And so I started a support group, I think it was in 1982, of Dutch Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And the difficulty was that I th -- that we came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , <span class="REGION">Westchester county</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> -- I had k-kind of asked her to send letters to the me -- <span class="REGION">metropolitan area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And we met the first time was kind of an interesting [indecipherable] maybe 20 people in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We met, and there were older people who had been in hiding, and younger ones, like people who had been in hiding when they were in their 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And one man said immediately, he said, “You know, we don’t need a group, we know who we are, but you youngsters, you were children and teenagers, you didn’t ha- you really didn’t have an identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">You suffered more than we did, because we had an identity.” </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And he wasn’t so wrong, but I couldn’t quite understand what this was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And so we met another two years with the people who were younger, because the older people said you know, that we don’t want the group, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We had this -- I had this support group with younger people who were children and teenagers in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And that was very interesting, only difficult -- we had a difficult time to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to meet, and -- and that kind of -- like I said, it was two years, that was until 1984. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And so we had- | ha -- I realized that y -- I found people I had something in common with. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I think what- maybe what I’m not talking about 1s that we really kind of led a so-called normal social life here, in -- in resh -- here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hastings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">You know, we went out, we had friends, we had dinner parties, but it -- it -- plus we were always a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It wasn’t that we were completely isolated from -- from -- you know, from our neighbors, or the parents of our friends, or friends we had made on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But it wasn’t like -- we didn’t quite belong, it -- I can tell you, we were at the dinner party, and people had invited some friends, and there were like a couple of couples, and there were two couples who didn’t know each other, and then they found out that they grew up on you know, in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , and all of a sudden, they had such a strong connection, even, to you know, I don’t know which one it was, Public PS whatever, and do you know that, you know, this one, and do you know that one, and what did you play in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , stickball, and you know, we didn’t do this, whatever they played. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I realized, I never can meet anybody who I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So these kind of things did happen, and I felt very kind of isolated, and when the -- when do I ever meet somebody I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So, I guess what I wanted to say to you is we kind of led an -- an -- a normal social life here, but felt different, because we had gone through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">When we -- When I had the s- support group of Dutch Hidden Children, we had some connection, I had some connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And in the meantime, I had become a Social Worker, and I was working as a Social Worker, and -- which was -- I -- I -- I loved my work, and -- but I didn’t have the same background as they had, although, you know, I was very well integrated in my, you know, professional community, of where I worked, at work, you know, there was -- | -- I- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Then, in ni -- 1980 -- 1990, we did our interview in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and it’s a very complicated story how we -- how they- how we found them, and how they found us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We did go for a weekend to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washingt</span> -- to be int -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to be interviewed, and I forgot ex -- was a terribly rainy day, and it wasn’t in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> yet, because the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> wasn’t there yet, 1t was somewhere else in the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I remember that I watched -- watched Ed on a monitor, but not in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and he watched me on a monitor, and we were completely wiped out after we had told the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It was really from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video, so it was from early years, and then into -- into the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And we were absolutely emotionally exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And that was really the very first time that I had told my whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I -- I even now get, you know, very moved about it, and I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So that was in 1990. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">At the same time -- at the same -- around that time, one of my colleagues gave me an -- he said, “You know, you might be,” -- I had spoken with him, I guess, about my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">He gave me an announcement of an -- of a conference in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , about the psycho-his -- the psycho-history association gave an -- an -- an -- an- an -- an conference for children of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And it was -- he said, “You might be interested.” </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So, I said, “Yeah, I might be interested to do that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So I went there, I took a day off, I went to that seminar, and there was a whole row of people there sitting behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and -- and I was there, and I -- you know, somebody was going to listen to all these papers they were going to present. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I listened to the papers they were presenting there all about -- they were very professional and they had done a lot of research on children of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And all I heard was kids who had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I, at one time I wanted to ask -- I ask a question to these professional people, was -- one was Judith Kastneberg, and some others, Eva Fogelman, and some others, and I ask a question, if they had done any research on children who ha -- children of the Holocaust who had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they said no, they hadn’t, they don’t have any data on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And somebody in the back heard my question, and came over to me, and she says, “You have been in hiding?” </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And I said, “Yes.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="337">You know, we are planning a conference for Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding, or children who had -- Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding, are you interested?” </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I said, “Yes, I’m interested.” </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So, we exchanged telephone numbers, and she said, and there’s a meeting whenever, to -- in one week or two week. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I went to that first meet -- for me that first meeting, of children -- wh- which was -- which was later called Hidden Children of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And they p -- were planning a conference from the Memorial Day weekend of ’91. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And so I started to work with them, and I said, “You know, I’m a social worker, I can plan workshops.” </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And so I got connected to this group of people who all were -- had been in hiding, and -- and wherever, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , not one from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And we started to work on this conference, which was very intense, and regular, you know, meetings, and planning, and shouting, and arguing, and -- and was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I started my work, getting workshop leaders together, I got -- you know, there were lots of people who had been in hiding, who were in the mental health profession, so I had no problem finding psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , or overseas, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I mean there were lots of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So I began my work with the Hidden Children, and in a ki -- in a sense, I found my community. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I -- I did things I had never done before. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I didn’t know anything about how to organize workshops, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I - | -- You know, we made all kinds of decisions about -- about the conference, how confidential it should be, who should -- what we -- we -- we planned workshops, we had to give names, you know, we had to find out what was -- what would be appropriate workshop for people who had been in hiding as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And we came up with all kinds of -- you know, we got some consultants, there’s a psychiatrist in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vancouver</span> , who was a hidi -- had been in hiding as a child, who had been very involved in child survivors of the Holocaust, so we -- we contacted him, and we -- we got all the names for the workshops, and -- and titles for the workshops, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We had to read up on it, you know, like abandonment, trust, you know, relationships, all these problems of -- of people having because of the Holocaust, and the experiences they went through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  What was that -- What was that like to all of a sudden look at these issues in such an intellectual way, rather than just from your own, you know --
ANSWER:  From my own exp -- oh, it was wonderful to do it in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Was great, I mean, I -- well, don’t forget, I have been in psychotherapy -- I ha -- in -- in therapy since ni -- I was in therapy already since 1979. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">1970, I had been in therapy, so I mean, I could look into -- intellectually in -- in a way that -- cause I had my -- you know, I had done some work in therapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">There was -- I think what happened that you felt kind of a little control, and a little power, to do it like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It wasn’t that easy when people talked about it, you know, when other people talked about how they were abandoned by their mother, when their mother waved them goodbye, or when they were placed in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , you know, I mean that -- that wasn’t easy to kind of listen to. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But to plan it, wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I still - End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  -- from where you were before, when you -- you said you did the first video interview, and that was the first time that you really told your whole story , sort of [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Chronologically, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  And -- And I wonder if you just could talk about that a little bit more, what that was like to begin to see that experience as a -- as a story”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  You know, you talked about how was it intellectually, you know, you can do all these workshops, you know, that -- the titles of the workshops, and you can talk about abandonment, and all this kind of stuff, and the -- the interesting thing is that when I have written a -- a paper about the vanished culture of Holocaust survivors, and I was just going to be published this summer, and I write about it, that there are other therapies for Holocaust survivors, other than individual and group therapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">There -- Such as giving a testimony in a chronological order, not only that you’re going to validated, but somebody is listening, and that your -- for whatever hours it is, to your story, rather than to just a brief segment, and -- but that you are being validated, that you go through it, that it is your story, that -- and not only I say that it is, you know, therapeutically very important for anyone to tell their whole story, chronologically, other professionals, I mean I -- it’s not my inve -- you know, I didn’t find that out, I -- I read that over and over again, from other professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It is -- I didn’t realize that it was so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Not that I’m watching my video, I never look at it, I -- you know, but it’s there, and we gave it to our children, as a document. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And you can see I get -- every time [indecipherable] and I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Because I have kept it -- You know, one of the workshops we have, keeping -- keeping a secret, I -- I actually did the workshop, keeping -- keeping a secret, and this 1s what we really have done, because we wanted to lead a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And we succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You know, we had -- we had a family, we had children, we went to the PTA meetings, we went -- we went on vacations with our children, but there was so much else. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So, I think that when I did this interview, in a sense, for the first time somebody listened, and asked me questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Like I said, I was -- I s -- I was -- I was validated, it was -- it appeared to be a very important document. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And when I so casually said, you know, they take a little s -- you know, a little piece out of, then put it on the -- I wasn’t pleased with what they took out at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , but it’s there, and -- and you know, when my -- my -- one of my daughter’s friends went to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and she said, “I saw your mother on the -- you know, on th -- on the -- on the video.” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Or -- And somebody else said, “I looked for you on the video.” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Something happened, something -- and like I said, something -- the story that I kept hidden all these years is now out in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So, I think that’s important. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It’s -- It seems to be more important than writing 1t down, because when I -- when I wrote my paper, or -- or when I spoke, you know at some conferences about it, it isn’t the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">It’s not that I’m talking about myself in the paper, but it’s about Holocaust survivors and their losses, and their -- the -- the terrible harm that it has done to people who have been in the Holocaust emotionally, and how people have continuously to suffer, some more, some less, and you know, s -- most of us every day think about the Holocaust in -- in a very -- Sometimes just a minute, you know, or -- or sometimes longer, but there’s always a reminder, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">There’s always in your life a reminder of the -- those years that we were in hiding, or even before. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">See, you must have seen in my video, that when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with my grandparents, I already was persecuted there in a s -- in a sense, because I couldn’t -- like [indecipherable] and my grandfather said, “Oh, you may not speak loudly, you may -- don’t -- don’t draw any attention to yourself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I saw -- you know, I saw the SS already marching around. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So I grew up with -- for a long time since 1936 until 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So I -- My -- My -- My whole life until 1945 was the Holocaust really, you know?

ANSWER:  Not Jewish as a religious person, Jewish as [indecipherable] people. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">One experience I remember 1s that when I was in hiding in the second -- with the second family, maybe a year into that, so let’s say that 19 - 1943 - 1944, at one time I realized I don’t understand that I -- I, or any -- or my mother, my brother, had to go through this. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Cause we were kind of innocent people, we didn’t harm anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And if there was a god, why -- why did He do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Why did He do this to us, and to the other Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And in particularly there was round -- when we -- we -- before the war, there was a Jewish family around the corner, they had two very small children, babies, and they -- somehow we knew that they were not in hiding, I don’t know why, but that they were shipped -- that they went to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I just could remember these little girls, and [indecipherable] what happened to them, and -- and you know, that they would not sleep in their own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and they would be somewhere in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , and I don’t know what would happen to them, we didn’t quite know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">These little kids, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Horrible, when I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So I -- I -- At the time when I was in hiding, I think about [indecipherable] of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Why, why did He put us here? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I mean, in hiding, we afraid every day for your life, and for the other people’s lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So, I kind of said, I -- I don’t es -- I don’t believe there is a God. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I still don’t -- I mean, I’m still struggling with this in a sense, because I don’t know how this all happened around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But we are not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We celebrate Hanukah, and Pesach, and Rosh Hashanah, mo-more as a -- as a tradition, and as ee -- having a Jewish identity, not necessarily religious identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And we were also [indecipherable], so we got kind of an -- a different identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">When you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , you - you don’t need to be religious to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So, our children were not Bar Mitzvahed, and Bat Mitzvahed, we have never belonged to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , we are not affiliated. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But when my mother -- before my mother died, I went to a - to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> down here, it’s a <span class="BUILDING">Reform temple</span> , went to the rabbi, if he wanted to do a service, and he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And when my mother died, I went down there, and he did the service -- graveside service, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So there is some -- I think it is more -- my Jewishness is more connected to tradition, and to the Jewish people, rather than to religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I went a little bit to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but that was not a very good experience, because my mother sent us to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> on the holidays, and she usually didn’t go, and -- and it was very boring, and it was all in Hebrew, and we didn’t understand anything, and -- and -- you know, the men were there, and the women were upstairs, and it was not a good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So, I guess you get the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  How about in terms of your [indecipherable] family, and -- you -- you talked a little bit today about the importance of having, you said, a normal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I think what we all -- most of us who went through the war wanted to lead a normal life, which meant getting married, and having children, although there are many -- quite a few hidden children who never got married because they’re -- they [indecipherable] had a terrible hard time with relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">With -- I got married when I was 19, and -- and I think that’s the most important thing, to have a family lead so called a normal life, have -- our -- both our children got married, they both have two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It’s amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I mean, that -- that this happened after we were not supposed to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So when -- when we had our anniversary, and yo-you know, months ago, there were our children and our grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Unbelievable, you know” So I think that’s -- th-the -- the accomplishment that we -- I’m most proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And they seem to -- a little -- I’m -- our children are affected by our Holocaust experience, they seem to be managing quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">My daughter is married for 23 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Our son is married for 10 years, more than 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So somehow we have instilled in our children that family is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They’re good parents, they are extremely good parents, sometimes a little too permissive, but they’re good parents, they love their children very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And you see it every day, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They -- So, I think that that’s my proudest accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you would want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  To what? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">To family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  To everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Oh, the -- you want to know a little bit? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">How much more do we have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  We -- We have enough time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Well, the -- the -- the mo -- the other important thing is that -- I was telling you about working on the Hidden Child conference, and that we did have the conference, and it was an incredible success. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We had -- We had expected 300 - 400 people, there was 1600 people and we didn’t know what to do, the people in the workshops, that were like workshops -- 75 people [indecipherable] you know, the workshops [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But it was such a success, and it changed many people’s lives, including my husband’s, which you probably will hear on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It changed because people found each other, connected with each other, and what we did after the conference, we started support groups, and I’m still running a support group here in <span class="REGION">Westchester county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We just had a meeting yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So that’s from August of ’91 until now, is eight years, we run -- once a month we have a meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It’s not always easy, but we do have a meeting, and I have been working since then for the Hidden Child Foundation, which is the organization, and in the last few years since I retired from the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> , and I only working part time at night, <span class="BUILDING">private practice</span> , I am working with Holocaust -- needy Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">What I’m doing is trying to help them connect with resources, financial or psychological resources, so that they don’t continue to suffer unnecessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And that keeps me quite busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I go once a week to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , and I work with -- I -- with <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> , or with the Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They don’t [indecipherable] to have been in hiding, anyone -- anyone who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or child of Holocaust survivors who are needy for whatever, psychological services, or financial services, I will connect them up with whatever 1s available. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So, that fills kind of, my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">This is not all, you know, because I s- spend about two -- two and a half days in my <span class="BUILDING">private practice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I have my family, whenever they want to come over [indecipherable] we always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But it is a major part of my life to be involved in Holocaust survivors, and their -- their needs, or just maybe a party or an -- an -- like we had yesterday a brunch, where people get together and connect, because that’s really one of the most important things for the survivors, to connect with others. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So -- Because, for instance, with hiding, we understand what it means -- when I talk to somebody else who has been in hiding, I know what it means to be -- have been in hiding, and have your schooling interrupted, your family life interrupted, your friendships interrupted, everything interrupted, I never was normal again after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  What -- What is it about you and your husband that have led you both to become so involved in this way, where others may -- may not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  Well, Ed wasn’t involved in the planning of the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I did -- I kind of dragged him along. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And then he got involved very much when -- with the sh -- with the Shoah Foundation, when he started to do the interviews, he got very involved, which is only I think the last three years or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I don’t know -- I am involved because I think I can contribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It’s my community. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Although socially we don’t get together, it’s -- it’s an interesting contradiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I can work with them, but socially, you know, with a few, but not with the whole -- with all the people that I am in contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I can only -- it -- it -- it feels -- it feels good to -- to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It -- I ha -- kind of -- I can contribute because I’m a social worker, ca -- ca -- I can do the work, it’s not difficult for me to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I -- I can’t really tell you why -- it -- it -- it just -- that’s what I need to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I can also tell you that I never was a member of any organization before this. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I never was a member of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadassah</span> , I never was a member of, like I say, of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I never was a member of any organization before I got connected to the Hidden Child Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I didn’t belong, I didn’t feel comfortable, I -- I me -- I mean, I am now a member of the Clinical Social Work Society, I go to their meetings, but it’s not the same, it’s a professional organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So, I guess that’s where I feel I belong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  I thank you very much.</span></p>
