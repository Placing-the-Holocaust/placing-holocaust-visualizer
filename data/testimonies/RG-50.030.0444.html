<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  It was -- I try to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was quite of course, to go up as a little, little one with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">You know, it was quite of course that we thought like our parents were thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And this was so tradition to have all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And at -- probably felt myself religious because I wouldn’t have touched what wasn’t allowed, for instance, ham. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I wouldn’t touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I would not, never as a youngster, eat what I was not allowed to eat for the religious reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  So that everything was kosher in your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yeah, in my family, my family, but not -- one friend of my sister’s family was also kosher, but otherwise all our friends were not religious at all, brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They were conscious Jews, I think, but not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">In general, they were very assimilated, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We all felt Viennese, and not Jewish Viennese. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We didn’t emphasize the Jews in -- but we felt very Viennese, of course, growing up there, and living there, and we loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, I am sorry I can’t say -- I mean, I think I only accepted what my parents expected from us children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  What many children --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  -- most children do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  At that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And then, afterwards, I mean when I was maybe 16 or 17 years old, I -- I felt different. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I felt that it is really some of the things I didn’t want to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">For instance, I wasn’t allowed to ring the bell when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">To me it was much more work to knock than ringing the bell like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Was this every day, or just on Shabbat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We were not allowed to ring the -- oh, excuse me, that -- that was a good question of you and a bad answer of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It -- yes, it probably was only si -- as -- as -- as -- Saturday Shabbes, you are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It was not the whole week.</span></p>
