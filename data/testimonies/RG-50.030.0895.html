<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  And she stated it with so much common sense, that nobody was arguing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So I stayed with my grandmother, and contacted my stepsister once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Very — you know, it — and then in three years they were together only — only three years, and then became 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so that day, that big day came, when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and military machines, and guns, and unbelievable attack on every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They just shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They August 26, 2016 were shooting without aiming. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They just were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And then a young man, a German fellow, soldier, came in yelling and yelling and pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Broke down the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , and he said, schnell, schnell, that means hurry, hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I had what I had on, not special clothes or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I just grab my pocketbook, and — and for — for 1-identification, and — and — and a little jacket, that’s all.</span></p>
