<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born in October 7th, 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">However, it was other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> when somebody else was born, like my father or my grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Tell us about your family and your parents...when you were very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">When it was still <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I was very little, my father, whose name was Shlomo Joszef, he was a Czechoslovakian employee, Czechoslovakian government employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He made the passports from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tisza River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He was a modern person even though we lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slatina</span> had a yeshiva and the majority of people were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We were kind of a little bit of an outcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We were modern people and they, the religious people did not like them people, did not stay in the same religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Her name was Fanny Joszef. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Her maiden Dicker, D-I-C-K-E-R. My father's date of birth was uh 1901. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My mother's date of birth was 1905. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">If you want more background I can go back generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">What I'd like to know is what was your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">What, what did you do as a little girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Well, we were three children and I was the oldest this and they called me Shari at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Yaffa is my new name in Hebrew and my sister who 1s fifteen months younger, Eva, and my brother was five years younger than me, was named Kalman Yoszef. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We were children in the usual sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a small <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We were not very rich but we were comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother was a very beautiful, immaculate woman, <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">01:03: The children...very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They were very disciplinarian for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I remember hearing my mother say to her friend, you can't show children too much love because then you won't be able to discipline them. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That's was the style at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We had to listen to our parents . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My father, as I said, worked for the Czechoslovakian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He also had parts in a <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> or he went to the <span class="BUILDING">cattle markets</span> to help buy the cattle and by our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we had a <span class="DLF">yard</span> with geese and chickens and a <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">As I remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The lower part was where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Then was the middle part and then was up, the upper part where the Okno ?? _, </span><span class="sentence" id="41">where the <span class="DLF">mines</span> ...there were <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We lived 1n the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slatina</span> , the part that I knew and most Jews know was the main <span class="DLF">street</span> with main <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and they were mostly Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We hardly knew the Christians because they didn't live between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We really separated ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It was not a shtetle atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It was more because of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> , was more sophisticated, let's say than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">However we Jews did stick together and we lived together and we were separated from the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My grandmother lived in...1 remember my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She made a living off making popcorn over flames and selling (it in) newspapers made into cones. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Our family lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for many...for quite a few generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Naturally it was not the same nationality because the <span class="NPIP">place</span> changed hands and not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ___.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  We went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Under Czechoslovakian government every...all children went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">However, let's say <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and things, that was percentages for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The numerus clausus. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Not all Jews could go because there was only certain percentage that could go...even under the democratic Czechoslovakians it existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So we all, all of us children did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">01:06: We were mixed with Christian children, but there was never closeness with the Christian children and our Jewish children in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There was a beautiful <span class="DLF">park</span> that we used to go to because it was <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and <span class="INT_SPACE">salt baths</span> , you know, for health purposes they had <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They had beautiful <span class="DLF">parks</span> where we went sometimes to listen to music, but not always did we dare go because there were always bad times for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I do remember as a young girl the Czechoslovakians had a <span class="BUILDING">sport complex</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokol</span> and they played tennis there and I just drooled. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I wanted to play so terribly, and naturally I wouldn't have been accepted and we don't even try. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I'm making up for it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Again my father knew many Czechoslovakians because he worked with them and the only intermingled my father used to go in once in a while in the <span class="BUILDING">billiard clubs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">At the time they played billiards, and he used to know a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I remember one...my parent's anniversary was on Purim, the holiday, and he got drunk once a little and he ran into the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we ran after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We were kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We didn't want him to because we were afraid, but he said, what is it you want from us Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">What did we do to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That was one occasion that sticks in my mind, but he was kind of a little fighter, my father, and that is how we lived until 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  What happened in '38?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  In 1938...I don't know the dates or so...but the Czechs left. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I remember they had colonies of beautiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , the Czechoslovakian people, up on the upper part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they left and the Ukrainians took over and I remember it only because we had to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I mean the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the same, but the language we had to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We studied up till now in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> Czech, and we had some good teachers, some not so good teachers, like every <span class="NPIP">place</span> else I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now the ___ were the Ukrainian fasc...uh fascists, like the SS the German, the _ the Hungarian, the ——_— was the Ukrainian uh fascist organization, but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we started learning the alphabet. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That's what Ukrainian use. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We learned their anthem, their national anthem, , which I still remember, and uh but they...Ukrainian hated the Jews more than the Czechoslovaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There was lots of fear and panic and sometimes they picked up some men and we never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And uh I only remember vaguely that there was a lot of panic around. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Supposedly there was a list of about three hundred Jews, maybe not all in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span> , to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Just a list of Jews to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But it seems to me that as of the same time when the Jews were supposed to be killed, the Hungarians came in and took over and we were very happy that the Hungarians came in naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">At least for a day or two we were happy, but then the atrocities started with the Hungarian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Generally, it was accepted that armies marching in will commit atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Ol:11: As kids we only heard that there were rapes and women tortured, breasts cut off...as children we heard those things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">However we kind of for a while felt comfortable because they didn't kill all those Jews with the list and the Ukrainians were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Naturally my father didn't have a job by then because the Czechoslovakian government wasn't there and they put him to work in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> , in the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> , down deep in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we became very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">However we were kind of proud people, my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I remember on Friday nights for the Sabbath that my mother covered empty pots on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> so we don't show anybody that we have nothing to eat, and that we have nothing to cook with, but all in all, my grandmother was making her popcorn and she then she moved in with us, and somehow we survived that part too. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And there were a lot of beatings from the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Sometimes they went around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , the Hungarians, all the villagers together which were not pure Hungarians...they were mixed Romanians, Hungarians, Slaves, Ukrainians, even Shobs (ph) were around in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and whoever was in their way or whatever they felt like attacking, they attacked and they hurt and they killed and O1:13: they took what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">My father worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> and he also tried to go to the <span class="BUILDING">cattle markets</span> to see if he can do some business because people still ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There were still a lot of butchers around and cattle and many times he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> beaten up and in the spring or early summer of 1941, while my father was away in a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , the gendarme or whatever...I don't remember anymore what they were calling the police...came with an order to tell my mother that in a week, in a week we will be taken away, that we are not Hungarian citizens and we will be taken away someplace else, to someplace where there is work, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now as I say, my father was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What my mother did at first is what every Jew, good Jew will do...take the children and go to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and open the Torahs (ph) and cry and beg. ..... </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">O1:15: And we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that evening when we came back from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with horses in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My father was brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> beaten very severely and we took him in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We did to him what we can and when my mother told him that we'll be taken away, she suggested we hide out and go to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sziget</span> or wherever and hide out, not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But my father felt it can't be any worse than it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">In a week's time everybody got a bundle. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We took what we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We were not allowed to take anything else except what we can carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They packed us into in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I don't know if there were seventy or a hundred or how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I know there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We were able to somehow stand and I also cannot tell you how long we were in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They were not fast, and they took us...we don't know how we traveled...the geography of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I can look at some names on the maps and remember where we were, but I don't know how we traveled with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about that ride? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">What was it like inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was hot and crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">No water. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">No hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They didn't open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for two, three days at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We had dead people in with us and when they stopped maybe every every three days when they stopped, we handed out the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They didn't let us do any hygiene or wash our clothes or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">If you had some food with you, you ate something but you shared with your people that you were around, but there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We kind of sat down everybody and where you could, but we really couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We stayed in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , night and day. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Hygiene or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Went on for I think about a week or so, because I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were put on <span class="DLF">side lines</span> and we stayed standing still. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were not always traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I don't know if they had a name where to bring us or not, but we were definitely standing still for many hours and hours and hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The heat and the smell were... a young girl...in 1941 I was twelve going on thirteen, I think...I can't count now. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I just remember the terrible smells and the terrible situation that it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But we arrived...I think the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yassinga</span> (ph) in the Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We got out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">01:19: I don't know how many died on the way, how many we handed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Most of the older people did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Our grandmother stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It was my family, my father, mother and the three children that were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yassina</span> they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , also piled very close on and drove and I think they dropped us off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomeia</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I'm not sure of the names and the route. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And we were still with the Hungarian guards when they dropped us off, and they said in the middle of a <span class="DLF">highway</span> they dropped us, you cannot come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We will shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">You can only go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , but from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> Ukrainian guards came with rifles and said to us, you can't go this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You can only go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We were on this on the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the Ukrainian shot started shooting and people were killed and I remember one of the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">His arms were shot off but it was hanging and bleeding and we were still in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we walked away to the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and most of the people sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Now we were a big group of people, because wasn't only from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but it was from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> doing the same thing, but the man that had his arm hanging begged, shoot me please. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Please shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">At that time they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They just let him stand and walk around with the families crying and begging. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">After a time...I don't know how much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I can't say. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They let us walk towards <span class="NPIP">inside</span> Galacia (ph) and but before that the man with the hanging arm was taken away and we heard the shots and the family dug a <span class="DLF">grave</span> at that time and they buried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I don't know where it is, but there in that <span class="REGION">area</span> we also met people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> that came at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Now they did not have <span class="NPIP">places</span> where to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We only walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> by the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and we kept on walking, day in and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">No water. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">No hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">If we were lucky enough to be by a <span class="DLF">field</span> that was growing something that we could eat and we can take it, we tried to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The shooting was very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Anything they didn't like...that was the Ukrainian . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Anything they didn't like or if they were annoyed they just take out the rifle or they hit with the rifle or they shoot with the rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They gave us rest maybe once or twice a day, and we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I don't know if it was twenty, twenty-five kilometers daily, children and older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I remember there was a boy that walked next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was a big transport by then...a few thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He carried his sick old mother whose legs were very swollen, on his shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He was young, about fifteen, sixteen year old boy...for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Each time we rested he took her off the shoulder, put her down to rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Then he got up, took her on the shoulder and carried her further and one day he didn't do it fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They killed the mother right then and there, by the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They wouldn't even give him time to bury her. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">01:24: We had to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The , they were very primitive people, very religious Catholics but very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Very hateful towards us Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Some of them were happy to kill us and hit us and do the worst that they can do to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Now at this time I only remember the walking and incidents that stand out. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that there was a <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I see it in the middle like. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I don't know where it was and what but it was a <span class="DLF">well</span> and we were like around the whole transport and the ___ were standing close to the <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">A little boy...to me he looked very little...went over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Said can I have water. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He said you want water, and the boy says please, water. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">He could hardly speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And he took his rifle and shot him right there, next to him by his feet, because the boy wanted water. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And that picture is with me through the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I I live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I mean I

class="sentence" id="201">Same day they picked out when we were resting at night by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , they picked out men. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I remember it well because we lay on my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We covered him, the children and my mother covered my

id="206">We never heard from them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They were killed. </span><span class="sentence"

QUESTION:  Tell us about what it was like at your uncle's.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  Well, my uncle lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Najvarod</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He and his brother-in-law, they had a <span class="BUILDING">brush factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They were at that time still pretty comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They were very religious and I came from a different type of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I did not get along with...they had one daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I was not very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We had our bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">brush factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I cut off one of my fingers with a knife there, but that wasn't the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But with my uncle I got along well, but with my aunt and the daughter who was approximately my age I would say...a little older, about three or four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I remember I needed guidance and help at a time in female... it was the time for me at the time and they were laughing at me and not because they were cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Because they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They were not aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They didn't know how to deal with what I brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from where I came . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I left there and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> where my sister lived, they rented like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in our family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My sister, a girlfriend of mine Franceska Nemeth, from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My sister worked in a <span class="BUILDING">sweat shop</span> sewing buttons and making buttonholes. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I took on the same <span class="BUILDING">sweatshop</span> , the ironing, for twelve, fourteen hours because it paid better and I was the older one. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was thirteen, fourteen ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="302">already. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I remember when I get my first pay, I mailed home five Pengo, the Hungarian money at the time, to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And that was 1942 when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and worked there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">When I could, I sent some money <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I understood from letters that my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goeren_</span> , later on my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sziget</span> where he was hiding out, so they were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and we were young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We tried to make the best of what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We met...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verilatse</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Utza there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish temple</span> , so we many times we went there to just be together with other young people at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> like then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  At the time uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in '42 and '43...there was anti-Semitism and there was hatred for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">However, you somehow could still work and live. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">You didn't need to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at the time either. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And you didn't have the yellow star at the time yet either. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Later on it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We lived and mixed with Christians and non-Christians, but the minute they found out that you're Jewish, they did not care very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The majority of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now I can't say that everybody was, but the majority of people did not like the Jews 10:41: and they didn't want to have anything to do with the Jews, but we were kids, young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we didn't feel...as a matter of fact I was going out with somebody that was non- Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He wrote poetry to me that I still remember by heart in Hungarian. (</span><span class="sentence" id="322">in Hungarian) . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">What it says that you are a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He wrote it for me, that you are a prisoner in your <span class="NPIP">dream</span> , but don't dream so much because when you wake up, you have to face reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So it 1t was, you know, you went to a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">You ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You clothed.(dressed’?) </span><span class="sentence" id="329">01:42 You did the usual things that when we went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to meet other Jewish young people, that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">This went on till 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">October of 1944 there was a coup against Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It was a happy day at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I'm sorry to say nothing happened to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">After that though we had to start wearing Jewish stars and we moved away from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> only. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">At this time we already had some money from working, many hours of very hard work, but we worked and we had some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I lived for about two years on bread and jelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I didn't mind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We moved away to a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I lived as a matter of fact in a what is called Okatsvo ? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Utca. ( </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It's a...well, later it became the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the...I don't know whether for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> the numbers it became.???) </span><span class="sentence" id="343">That's how it went on till 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">My sister lived someplace else from me and the real serious trouble with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and everything started in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">You couldn't go to work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You had to wear your stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You couldn't go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">After a certain hour you had to be back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You you couldn't go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and it was very, very, very hard because nobody was prepared for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You had to get out of your own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and move in the ghetto part. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In late 1944...I think in the middle of the summer of 1944 all the Jews had to go toa <span class="DLF">raceway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I don't know if you ever heard about that gathering of the Jews on the <span class="DLF">raceway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And from there...
QUESTION:  Tell us about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Excuse me...tell me what happened at the gathering. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  In the <span class="DLF">raceway</span> ...it was just people. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Just more and more people coming into the <span class="DLF">raceway</span> because they were gathering all the Jews from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I haven't got a clear picture of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I just know that we were put in certain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , groups of people, and they started marching us towards the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which naturally we don't...at this time I didn't even know that we're not bordering <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...we approach <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and we marched in groups, but it seems to me that there were a lot of young people, because I remember I had experience from 1941 that I tried to gather young people and we sing songs, most Hungarian, because Hungarian Jews didn't know any other language. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I knew other languages, but Hungarian Jews knew only Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And we started singing songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It somehow kept the spirits going. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I didn't think of it consciously at the time, but that's what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we walked and walked, but one good thing...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> the villagers and the people, they're not as bad and as cruel as in <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">In <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> we sometimes, we were cute little girls, you know, go to a <span class="DLF">fence</span> and they will give us a bread or something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It was for them too very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It was towards the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There wasn't much left there either. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But they once in a while did reach out and gave us some food and we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called close to or ...1 can't even pronounce it. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I have it marked out on the Hungarian map. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and they...we settled in on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> because they said that's where we have to wait for transportation to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Dysentery broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Diarrhea and stomach upset for the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Again, no hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I don't know how we survived and how we were on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We were there about two, three weeks and there I heard that there was ..I don't think it was an order or a request...that children under thirteen should be returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and by that time I was about close to sixteen, seventeen, and I said to my friend Francesca, who was with me at the time...now and again my sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> but she had Christian papers in her own name made. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I don't know to whom or who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It could have been Wallenberg or not, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">She had in her own name, Eva Joszef, Christian papers, and she lived out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">She didn't go to the <span class="DLF">raceway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">She stayed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">In between I tried to study in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> Catholic religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They said that if you became Catholic, they will keep you alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">They will not take you away, so I studied the Catholic religion and then I found out it wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I did not take on another religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I stayed Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So my sister was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I don't know where she was...safe supposedly with Christian papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I was with Francesca, my girlfriend, Francesca Nemeth, and I said let's go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I don't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I know what they do to people there, and she didn't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">She was afraid and I begged her and kind of coerced her. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I said you carry on, put your hair in braids and uh let's try and let's try and we we succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We walked back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I called Francesca. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">She lives in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I wondered if she remembers names or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">She does not remember anything, but she was just thanking me for keeping her alive, because she says that if not you, I wouldn't have been alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But at the time I just felt that this is our way of surviving, to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We walked again back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I don't know how many kilometers, how we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We were a small transport of children and we walked but while we were still on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , we got some of the Hungarian village people to gave us geese. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We cooked the geese and we gave the soup for the dysentery sick people, the soup, and we handed out meats for the children to eat, for the young children to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I remember I was very involved in that and many people ...1 don't know where they went from there, but some died. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Some got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I don't know if it was from the soup or not, but that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and we went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , into a Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I don't know if it was a Swedish or a Swiss Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Supposedly a safe <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , on Okativo ? </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Utca. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It was the same <span class="DLF">street</span> I lived, but further down. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We were there...it was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from an electric I think public electrics or something like that and they had anti-aircraft guns on the same <span class="DLF">street</span> right across from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="418"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was at that time being bombed from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Constant bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Terrible bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">All that time we were in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> with helping mentally disturbed people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as a result from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They were all lying on <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">No medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">No hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Some I remember they bring in people who got hurt from the bombs, you know, from shrapnel, they brought them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It was terrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Some of them lay there for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The the meat was rotting away from their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">The smell...it was horrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The dead people were taken out to the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They were piled like wood logs piled, cross-wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">One on top of the other, the dead people, and I know only about the Jews because that's where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but I know it was not very good in the rest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> either, but we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">To that to the bombing and everything else, the Nilosz (ph) which was like the SS in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , came in many times to safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> to people and started killing and letting their angers and fear go to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We being Red Cross used to go out and help save whoever we could save at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We walked even while they were bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We walked in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and go into <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and see if we can help as much as we could with just get living out from under the dead or whatever we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I had a bladder infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We had no sulfa or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I remember somebody handed me a little...an old sock with sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They said heat it someplace and put it and try to make yourself comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I don't know how and when I'm OK, but this is...I'm bring it up only as to show you what it was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> until of January of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I never went down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with the bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I was at the stage where I didn't care if something gets me, if I stay alive or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">At that stage I didn't care, and one morning I looked down from the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and there was the Russian army, and being that I speak other languages, some Czech, some Yiddish...there was a Jewish officer in the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvow</span> and he said you're free. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I said what! </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He said you're free. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And he came out with breads, loaves of breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">There were very few people left alive, but whoever was we all went down in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> where he was with the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That's how that's how we freed, and that was in January of 1945 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Do you want me to go on anyplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Let's stop for a moment now and we'll change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">This is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Tape #2 Life has a different meaning...it has a different flavor I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We're back on camera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  I'd like to go back to the safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and would you...would you tell me more, as much as you can remember about the people in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  It's very unclear about the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I do not... cannot pinpoint an organization, if there was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I just know that the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had a sign, a Red Cross sign out. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I know it was a foreign Red Cross, Swede or Swiss Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It keeps in mind more Swiss than Swedish Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">The people whenever they picked up people in the <span class="DLF">ghetto streets</span> that had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and we brought them in, not that there was <span class="NPIP">place</span> but we just put them down next to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">After bombing, people were injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">If they were injured we brought them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">If the horses were killed, we used the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That's what kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It was winter, so even the horse laid in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for many days, we used it, kind of gave us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I don't remember people themselves, if there was anybody to instruct us. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I know that there was some sick people that turned to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I was healthier. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I was around. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">My friend Francesca was there on a different <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and we tried to do best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There was nothing to work with or help with. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I remember one young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">He had internal injuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There was one doctor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I can't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But he said he has internal injuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He was twenty...I don't know...to me he looked young at the time, and I remember holding him and he says, just stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Just stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Just stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I tried as long as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">When the sirens went on, the majority of people that could move went down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to protect themselves from the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I never went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I picked...I didn't care if I live or die at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We were at the state of non-caring and that is the worst human state that you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Nobody should go to that state, but we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I can't clearly bring up people to remember them or or names or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">01:03: I haven't got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I just know that one day in 1945 we looked down in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and there were the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And we couldn't care less who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They brought us bread and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">No heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">No hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">For weeks on and weeks on we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I don't know how it was in the rest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was inhuman. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Inhuman state of...I don't even remember how we dispersed from that safe <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very fast because we were afraid that the Hungarians will come back or the Germans will come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So we ran from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I ran from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but I wanted to find my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">She was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> but not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I was going from <span class="DLF">street</span> to <span class="DLF">street</span> at the time the Russians freedom, it was kind of open. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was snow all around and I was walking towards where we used to live before and I see a black coat with a white fur cap and I started screaming Eva, Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">That's how I found my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , right after we were freed by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It looked that she was searching for me and I was searching for her, and we walked 01:05 somehow going towards the same direction, and with all those people and all the war and everything, somehow we kind of ran into each other and I can't tell you that feeling to be able to see my sister and her black coat that I remembered with the white fur around her head and find my sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We started back. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We were...today they call it hitchhiking I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Whatever transportation we could find...we wanted to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> the worst, the worst way because we were afraid that the Nazis might come back in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I remember we were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There was no organized <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Whatever came along and went someplace, we hopped on and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We also had to kind of at that time worry a little bit about the Russians not grabbing young girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They grabbed other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I know they grabbed many watches and an army, as an army and any army that comes in first, you're better off not to encounter with them, but somehow we made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> , and stayed for a few weeks with a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And then we went on further and I went, I went towards <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I don't know where my sister went, but she wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We young girls we were not very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Sibling rivalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We're very close in age...fifteen months apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She's younger...fifteen months. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We went our different ways, but she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and as I said before that I think I mentioned it to you privately that uh when I saw the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...1t might have been a lot of things together... found _ high temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was ripped...the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were ripped out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The <span class="DLF">roof</span> was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Papers thrown everyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Nothing...I collapsed and they took me into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sziget</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they took my tonsils out or whatever they did for me, and when I got better I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> to see my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We traveled all over and when I came back...then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Another thing...in every terrible thing there is something that happens that can give you hope in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I heard that my mother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , you know, if you went you...in certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> they gave you disinfection, DDT, and shower treatments for the people that came out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and...and they also gave you some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The Americans at that time were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They gave you some money to help you over...peanut butter and some food and things like that and we kids went in for that to help us travel around. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I went into one of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> where they did it, and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> I hear Sharika, Sharika. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">My mother was in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">She came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> and she came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and she was there in transfer in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">Elizabeth School</span> it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="549"><span class="BUILDING">Ersebet School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I ran into her like that in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We just couldn't believe that that what we ran into. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">As I say, there 1s always some kind of hope that gives you a will to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I found my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">She wasn't the same person anymore but I found my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">My mother lost her will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">However, we were together for a while and we went to...we had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galanta</span> and we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Later on uh my mother married that uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It was...let me see...my father's sister's husband who never came back and my father never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">That was a year or two later after the war and they married and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Germany camps</span> to wait, waiting camps until they were transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">01:10 I joined in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> the Zionist organization and we traveled around to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and for a while I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The transient people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They called it a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> where the doctors examined and I was kind of an assistant in there for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> with the Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Dror Habonim was the name of the organization, and for a while I still helped out with the Brichah to transfer people over the <span class="DLF">borders</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They were in transferring the people to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and then transferring them back to towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> where there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transient camp</span> and then toward <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and then from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , whatever <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> can be arranged for the people to go to <span
