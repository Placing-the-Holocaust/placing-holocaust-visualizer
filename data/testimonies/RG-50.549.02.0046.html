every child has -- anyway, in 1941 in January, my -- the child was born on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> like this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , a wooden <span

id="209">And I somehow -- what I saw what they were doing to children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I p-p-pledged that I would see to it that they wouldn’t put a finger on this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">You know, just I -- Pll do everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And then, what started, you know, I was going back and out, you know, for the child also bring a little milk, or something, to feed her, you know, and -- and in -- I was caught by [indecipherable] on the way back, I was caught by the Gestapo, and I was imprisoned, and you know, the conditions in those <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> that time were terrible, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">You had to -- Now, not a single criminal in <span

Jewish people were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Now, my father met a Polish policeman, of German descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">You see, there were just like in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , somebody may be American citizen that has grandfather or great-grandfather was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So, they call it [indecipherable] of German descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We had this man of German descent, and he found out that he had some connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He all -- called up to him, he said, “Look, I don’t have any cash, but we have a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> set in hiding by Polish friends, that we gave the set to our children when they were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We will give you the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> set if you to -- see to it to release me from

was a deal that he -- he -- he -- he knew probably somebody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Anyway, they release me from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and we -- when I came back, of course how happy they were, but later again, at night, they came and they took me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Now, what he did, undoubted -- that’s -- that’s the way we -- we assumed they -- I’m sure, he probably told them, “Look, I can get my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> set if you let him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Later, you ca -- any time you want to, you can get him back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They came at night, at -- at -- at our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and took me back to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that time, let me tell you this way, 26 men in one <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">You can’t imagine the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">In the morning, at five o’clock, the <span class="DLF">door</span> would open, the two German Gestapo men, with the German Shepherd. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">When they were pointing a finger at one of the prisoners, s -- and say Juda, which means in German language Jew, the German Shepherd was trained to jump at this Juda, you know, and to tear him apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Every second <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> they were like this, every second, they open, you know, and they were killing, like murdering three or four ki -- men, and then later replacing them, so always 26. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But then, this was already 1942, and I found a -- 1-1 -- 1n -- in -- in June, I found out that they liquidate -- liquidating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Liquidating it means they are going to take the people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Now, in order to have again access to all those people, they surrounded first <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">nursing homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , some <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , or whatever, you know, they got children in, and also prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Anyone in relatively good health was taken -- loaded into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , -- you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka concentration camp</span> was -- I call the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">destruction camp</span> , was about 80 or 90 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">1,000,000 Jews were ki -- destroyed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Now, anyone that was -- let’s say children, or teenagers, or people older that were not, you know, in -- in the best health, they were taking to <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , which was outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , was too big to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they were executed there, and thrown into <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> that time, had approximately 300 - 350 bodies, each <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And the -- Some of the children were half -- not yet dead after they shoot, you know, or a little breathing, or so, they still were thrown into the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Now, when they surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , we’re all -- open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , wi -- every one of us had to go down to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , you know, out and loaded -- tol -- they would load us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And there was tremendous chaos als-also that time, there was just hundreds and hundreds, you know, of the -- anyway, I was able to escape from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , together with few other men. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We had no prison uniforms, just to -- you know, just old clothes to -- I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you can imagine how my wife, and my parents, and in-laws, how they saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">My father, [indecipherable] my in-laws, how they saw me, how happy they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And I told them, look, what they were doing to children, what I saw, and so on, I -- you are not go -- I -- I am going to do -- work out something. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I had connections with some people from the Polish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I work out forged documents that were Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">My wife, the baby and I are Roman Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">She also was blonde, looks like Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And the -- the -- the ka -- you know, the documents that we had, the forged documents, the stamp, swastika, I took a potato, a regular potato, cut out the potato, made a stamp out of it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">To make the first -- the swastika pi -- stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And that’s was our document. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">If they would look closely, that -- at it, they probably would realize, but you know, ju-just to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Anyway, and I arrange an escape, how I arrange the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Our child was that time -- this was -- we planned everything, after everything was organized, I planned, you know, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , far -- to far -- about seven -- 80 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaws</span> , everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">It took us, you know, close, you know, all t-the June and July. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I plan, on July 31“, 1942, I plan the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Now, a friend of mine, a young doctor that was there also wun, he injected her, put her to sleep, the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">She was about one and a half years old at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Do you know what he gave her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Injection, to put to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  But you don’t know what it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  No, I wouldn’t know, and I didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He said, “I will put her to sleep.” </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So he injected her, put her to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We put her in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My wife -- Men couldn’t do it, men couldn’t be -- wouldn’t be allowed to follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">My wife followed the funeral -- I mean, funeral, it was just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> with the horse, you know, and the horseman, and the -- and -- and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">She put on a piece of black material, she put on [indecipherable] on her head, and she walk aw -- and she went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">When she went -- came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , the <span class="DLF">Gestapo gate</span> , they wanted she -- they sh -- that they -- the horseman should open the ga -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> , to see, maybe some smuggling going on, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But my wife said to -- to the man, that she died from typhus fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">You see, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because of the conditions, very bad con -- the -- thousands and thousands of people died from typhus fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So my wife said -- and so here -- wu -- th-those -- those be -- they were like, you know, th-they were very brave with harmless people, with children, with it, but they were scared of -- to death of contagious diseases, so he moved away from it, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> , and she went through to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The gravediggers wanted to pick up the baby, throw in the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">My wife screamed out, “She’s alive, don’t touch her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They can’t believe their eyes, they couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But you see, here again, I thought everything in advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">On Jewish cemeteries, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , on Jewi -- only Jewish gravediggers were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Not others, like here, let’s say or so, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So, like here, when my wife was buried, in <span class="DLF">Shalom Memorial Park</span> , here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , you know, in the suburb of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , three months ago, you know, there were not -- not Jewish gravediggers. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Now, we got [indecipherable] they -- I wasn’t afraid of any betrayal. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So they -- anyway, they took out the baby, with my wife, and they too -- put them in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where before the war they used to wash the bodies, prepare for regular, you know, burials, you know, normal funerals, and they were waiting for me over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">In the evening, I again, like always, slipped out to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and I went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , met her at close to 10 o’clock in the evening, with the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Now, with -- you see, the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> had -- they were -- adjoining <span class="DLF">Polish cemetery</span> , and <span class="DLF">Tartar cemetery</span> , there were <span class="DLF">brick walls</span> in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I made -- work out with the <span class="DLF">Tartar cemetery</span> -- Tartar cemeter -- cemetery, the caretaker that I will knock at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> with a stone, and he will drop a stepladder, and we will go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and we gave him something for it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And would go out, and we’ll be on the other -- and then we’ll escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I knock at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> with a stone, he let out the stepladder, went on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we slept the first night -- nobody would suspect that we are such, you know, idiots. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We slept in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where -- si -- there was -- the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was, I think, six or seven story, I don’t remember, but up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , there was Gestapo po -- railroad police, above the regular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we slept there one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The man that wa -- he was a member of Polish underground, but he didn’t know that we are

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and this was -- I prepared a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , about 75 - 80 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , where I would -- there was a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I would work in the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> as a laborer there, and then, my wife with the baby would be there, I would took a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and --from a peasant -- p -- the pe -- the Polish peasants, the tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know, with the w -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron stove</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> with the pipe, and it -- one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Three of us would sleep in the one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Now, it’s a -- it’s a -- a wooden -- you know, s-story -- it’s a one story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , small. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Now, I prepared there a very ground -- very deep <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> for my father and my in-laws, they could not be in the open, you know, as Gentile people. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So I prepared a -- a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , a very low do -- very deep <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Yeah, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  So, you know, anyway, when I came t -- first of all, when I came back, I found out that my in-laws, and my father, you know, were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I told you I went there to get them, I came back, told my -- I had to tell my wife about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You can fi - riz -- realize how she felt about it, but we decided one thing, we’re going to live for no other reason, to save the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Do everything in our power to save the child, both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And we did it, we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">My wife was going every week to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">At night, in the evening, before we’re going to sleep you know, she used to, very loud at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , pray for the night, so the neighbor, you know, the one that we ri -- renting the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from, she would hear it, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And that’s -- nobody would suspect us, you see, that we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And, of course, we were raising the child, and we were very, very poor that -- I mean, I was working, I was getting rations in the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> , as a laborer, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But that was -- we were going through all kind of different times, and I also had to watch, you see, very carefully, you know, that shouldn’t sometime recognize, or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">There was one -- one boy that was a clerk there, not a laborer like I, was v -- 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Very delicate, very gentle, good looking, and a blonde boy, and he always [indecipherable] he saw me to -- picking up a big piece of lumber, let’s say, you know, to put away, he said, “Mr. Podalski,” -- I was already in comparison old man, I was in my -- you know, 20’s, he said, “Let me help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I said to my wife many times when I was coming to the -- where I -- walking distance from the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> , I said, “You know, there is working one boy, I am very suspicious about him, he is too delicate, he is too gentle. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He’s ats -- I don’t know, he’s not an average,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And I want -- I said, “I’m going to find out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And I walk over one day to him, I said, “Look, Wally, how about to go with me Sunday to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I didn’t go like my wife was going, I didn’t, but you know, I said Sunday to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">He says, “Okay, why not?” </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was about three kilometers away from the <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> , you have to walk on the <span class="DLF">highways</span> , and on bo -- on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , on both sides of the <span class="DLF">highway</span> were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> -- <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I walked with him, I said to him, “You know, Wally,” -- in Polish, of course, “what would- wis t -- what should we do if some Jewish people were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , would run out and attack us?” </span><span class="sentence" id="401">He said, “Mr. Podalski, I don’t think there are any, but if they are, they are happy they will li -- that they are left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They’re trying to be in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They wouldn’t torture, they wouldn’t hurt us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I said, “Wally, I am Jewish, how about are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And he embraced me, he started to cry, the boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He was Jewish, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I wri -- I wrote about him, and that whole story, in my book, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So, you know, he was Jewish, too, he was killed later. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Anyway, we -- so we had all kind our tol -- our dow -- our daughter while we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">One day, she devel -- she got sick, she got very high fever, and my wife went with her by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">children’s hospital</span> , to check with the doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They check her, they said, “Oh my God, she has tuberculosis.” </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And the only way we could save her would have -- she has a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in her lung, the left lung. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The only way we could help, if you could have gold injections, so we could, you know, cover the -- with the gold injections, the -- the <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the lung, and she would be saved -- you know, got rid of the bi -- tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We didn’t -- We couldn’t -- We wouldn’t have a penny, we couldn’t dream about gold injections. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But then we had an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We had a very close friend, a Greek, Stamatos Kokinikis. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He used to have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halivah</span> , you know, making. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was business, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I used to -- I was an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">My wife graduated <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I -- You know, and I, like a -- you know, like here, you know, accountant si -- let’s say, you know, public, or a peer -- a regular accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Anyway, and I was taking care of his books, so my wife went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I -- Later I found out that he was arrested few times even, because he was helping Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But he had connections with the <span class="BUILDING">Italian embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , because Italy- Hitler and Mussolini were allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So he said -- My wife told him about the gold injections. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He said, “Don’t worry, I get it for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And he got it through the <span class="BUILDING">Italian consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">He got injections and he gave it, he save our child. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And when she was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , his -- he had a maid, a Polish woman, who knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">She used to come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to bring her goo -- you know, some good food and things, you know, to -- to give the child, you know, the -- well, you know, she a Polish woman, you see, she was doing it for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So, anyway, and then sh -- when she was later okay, our daughter, and there were times when we -- you know, were s -- were scared all the time, because we still had to watch ourselves and so on, but somehow, you know, we’re through -- the whole t-time, or like this, and nobody could recognize us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But one day, when the -- the Jewish boy was killed, you see, 1 -- had -- I write a -- 1-1-1n the book about his family, and how they were -- why they were killed, and so on, but you know, we were scared that they may [indecipherable] because they knew that I was close already, you know, always with the boy -- go nice with the boy, and that I was -- his parents were there, living not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So anyway, I put our daughter in a <span class="BUILDING">sanitortum</span> , because you know, to- altogether that she should be, you know, well taken care of, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And we were watching, and so on, and one day -- and I f -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Germans trucks</span> surrounded the -- the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> , looking -- I di -- that time I found out, looking for his fa -- the boy’s parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Now, what I found out -- not for his, but they looking for the more Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">What I found out anyway, that his father -- you see, they were from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and he -- they were very well-to-do people, very well off, he had a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But his father in the -- they all pretend, three of them also, that they are, you know, Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But his father, in order to operate with the peasants, that they -- together he was making -- they were making whiskey, you know, in many -- the some -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> some, you know, <span class="BUILDING">home</span> made whiskey, and he was with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And -- And I understood that -- that something came out that he probably was in there drunk, or something, that they suspe -- you know, that they called the Gestapo, that we think that they are Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And they came one night there, and they killed him, and th -- th -- the -- the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But after this, you know, we were already shaken, we were very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So one day, there was a man working in the -- a laborer, but he was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where they had all kind of things there, you know, in the <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> , but anyway, a Polish man, and he came over there to our little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we lived there, and he said, “You know, I had to get drunk to tell you, because I didn’t have never spoke to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Somebody here asked whether you are also Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I wouldn’t like this should happen to you, what happened to the [indecipherable] -- to the other one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Listen to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And he said, “But my wife said to me, “You see, it’s all your fault, especially that there was that.’”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She says, “Y-You trying to, as a Polish officer, you’re trying to do everything, you know, for the [indecipherable] and th-th-then they call you here, they think that you are Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="449">You know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She just made it so that -- and he said, “Oh my God, I am so -- I love you,” he said, “I,” -- you know, changed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And [indecipherable] but we already scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And then there was occasion I wrote about in the book, I left the [indecipherable] and got the job in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , you know, and somehow we survived like this, that in 1944, in August, were liberated by the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And you know that 1-1-1n ’41, they started -- they became enemies, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So, for two years they were allies, and later they were enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So that’s what it was, and they were liberated that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And so you go on farther, what you want more?</span></p>
