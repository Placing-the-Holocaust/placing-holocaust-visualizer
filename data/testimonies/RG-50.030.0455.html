ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Would you be kind enough to give your name in there and tell me where you were born and where you lived as a young child and how you got to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is J-Juergen Simonson. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father was a judge in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">His parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">But, under Nazi laws we’re regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan, and so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 percent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We were in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">east Germany</span> , where my father was working as a judge and then when Hitler came in, in ‘33 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and lived in -- in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> , until 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish background in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a move to a bigger <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where they might be more anonymous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Do you have memories of that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  What are your memories of that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  My memories are that I went to this -- to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as <span class="BUILDING">second grade school</span> and my main and most painful memory is that -- well, I noticed that for some time, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends distanced themselves from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I used to walk with them to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then there came a time when they said they wouldn’t want to walk with me any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  And you were how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I was then -- 1938 -- 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Born in 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And one day, after break, I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and there on the notice board, written with chalk, it said, “The -- the Juda mus game.” </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The Jew must be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Which of course was awful sh-shock to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So -- my class teacher was very embarrassed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I left immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My parents had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> -- because my father’s sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And I was being looked after by a niece. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And in the afternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see what I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I mean -- this, sort of -- so typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn’t want to be involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So after the weekend, my parents came back, they’d found a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> and within, I think 24 hours, I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Never looked back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And --
QUESTION:  You felt you’d be safe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , m-more. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And, in fact, my father found a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me, where I was admitted by the headmaster, who knew my background, but was prepared to take me on. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And, until ‘42, I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , had very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends and even managed to do my -- take my matric in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Pll come back to that in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I just want to mention that two years ago I was back in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> , with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> right on the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I suddenly realized I was only about 50 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> , where I was brought up and where I had this [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  How do you spell that name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  F-o-r-s-t.
QUESTION:  Just as it sounds, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And decide to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was a harrowing experience, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had been just on the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , had been overrun by the Russians and really looked like a very neglected <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">eastern town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before ‘33, in the early days of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And went round the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to identify my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and one or two other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Went back to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , had a few minutes to spare. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Went back, waited at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Walked down <span class="BUILDING">station</span> roat and remembered that one of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends used to live there and he -- his father had a <span class="BUILDING">agricultural place</span> , <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I was totally amazed that the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was still there, with the same name, Lishgut. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and said, “Yes, my father-in-law 1s here, I’ll go call him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he was out in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , I went out and said, “Hello, could I speak --”. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He didn’t recognize me after 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I mentioned my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And he looked at me, took my hand and before he said anything else, said, “I’m so very sorry for what we did to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And it’s been always on my mind.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we --
QUESTION:  Did you think he meant what he said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  -- and we embraced each other and I said to -- quote, “That was a long time ago, let’s forget about it.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we only had 15 minutes before my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was due, to catch up on 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And then of course we kept in touch by letter afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And w -- he said, “I’m so glad that we’ve met again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But it was an extraordinary experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And he died a week ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Did you keep up with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  SO -- yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Yeah, after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  So I was so glad that --
QUESTION:  That you’d gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  -- I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  -- and that we met again by pure chance, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Luck, luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And there a sort of reconciliation took place, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  He probably didn’t know what had happened to you, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">No idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  So he must have been so glad to see --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Didn’t know that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Amazing, that’s amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  So then, as I say, I took my matric -- matric in ‘42. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because of my Jewish background, fortunately I was n-not allowed to be called up to the armed forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">All my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends were. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Most of them perished, many on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And quite a few were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And in the end, there were only four of them left and we still meet, every other year, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Really, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  So I had to do some kind of forced labor -- first in <span class="BUILDING">armaments factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , on the <span class="INT_SPACE">shop floor</span> and then in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  And where were your parents now, this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Oh, yes now, my father knew that his life was really in danger, but was very difficult to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You had to be sponsored by somebody abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And as it happened, years before, he had met a young, English student, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> , who was staying with a family of friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And my father had written to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He’d, in the meantime, become a British diplomat and was out in the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , but came on leave in ‘38, saw this letter and wrote back to say that yes, he was prepared to sponsor him. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And so in March, ‘39, he left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">With 10 shillings, that was all he was allowed to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And really no -- no job in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I mean, as a judge, he really had no chance to find a job in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  How many siblings did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I was the only one. [</span><span class="sentence" id="95">indecipherable]
QUESTION:  You were the only child? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So when you say he left us, he left your mother and you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  My mother and me, that’s right, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  And, do you remember your reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Well, of course was a terribly sad moment for all three of us, to be separated and not to know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Now, I think I will first tell you about my father, perhaps, at this point, because in the sequence of events, that comes next. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , was met by this wonderful man, Dudley Cheek, who has since died, who later became an ambassador, British ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And stayed first with -- he had some distant relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and then stayed with other people, but of course had no prospect of an opening for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He had become an active Christian towards the end of his time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He used to go -- there was an <span class="BUILDING">Anglican church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , which he used to attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And there was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , an organization called the British German Christian Fellowship, with which Bishop Bell was associated. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">He was the --
QUESTION:  The British German Christian Fellowship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Of which he, I think, was the chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  And father was introduced to him and there were -- 1n his typical way, sort of pulled out all of the stops and eventually, in September ‘39, father was given a case at <span class="BUILDING">congregational theological college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112"><span class="BUILDING">Cherchant College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">As a student again. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He’d been a judge and started again from scratch --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  -- there, as a -- as a student.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Theological student. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And in the meantime, he had also arranged for us to follow him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Again, some kind people had offered accommodation and there was even a place for me at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And we wer-were supposed to follow in September ‘39. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">September ‘39 of course was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We literally missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  By about a week before that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  What -- what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  So we went on living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My mother was eventually declared a widow, because my father was no longer regarded as being alive or -- for all intents and purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Did you -- she was not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  No, she wasn’t, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  So therefore, she would have been allowed privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  But you would not have been allowed them, because you were --
ANSWER:  Yes, but I was partly protected by my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I’ve just been going through it all again, because I’m now writing quite a few notes about the Holocaust in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because the Holocaust was not only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Have you come across -- do you know German, or --
QUESTION:  No, I don’t speak German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  There is a -- there are some diaries by a German professor called -- it -- I'll look it up later -- who t -- who was a -- again, a Jew married to an Aryan lady and what they endured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Th-They -- it was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , this diary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  And he writes every day, secretly, his diary is about this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And what they endured 1s just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">In the end, out of 5,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , 60 were still alive at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  5,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , 60 alive at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  All the others were deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  All the others were deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Ta-Taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Let me stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I just want to --. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">What was your -- what was your main fear? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You hadn’t made it, you didn’t know whether you’d renite -- reu -- reunited with your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">What -- what were the signs around you that -- that were most frightening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  That one really had no idea what the future was going to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">That one really lived from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We lived a relatively normal life, because of my -- thanks to my mother being Aryan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  And how did she protect you? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You were -- you yourself were half-Jewish, how did she protect you? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Did she not discuss what you were, or did you -- did people know or what? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I mean, it sounded like it was very evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, fortunately, as a -- I mean Jews from ‘41 on, had to wear the yellow star.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  The yellow star, so --
ANSWER:  I didn’t have to wear that, so --
QUESTION:  But how did you get away with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Because, I -- as a half-Jew or half-Aryan, I didn’t have to, it was only full Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">This wh- whole crazy legislation of 100 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was 50 percent and so I could not be treated like a normal human being, but on the other hand, I was not treated as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was sort of in-between.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  What -- what did that mean for you, in terms of having friends who were Aryan, who were not Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  They -- I mean, looking back on it now, I am absolutely amazed, because I mean, obviously I was, to a certain extent, probably being watched. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But they -- they stayed low and treated me as -- just like a -- very good friends and so I owe a great deal to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Then, of course, the critical time came in ‘44, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And at this point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler’s ministers, to be engaged in emergency work, for instance, the building of the <span class="DLF">Atlantic wall</span> and the repair of bombed <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> , <span class="DLF">lines</span> and all that sort of thing, in east and west. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So we were not soldiers, but we were sort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We didn’t wear a uniform, we just wore an armband which said, Tut Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And we were made -- made up of people with my background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">A queer mixture of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And when was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">April °44, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen to her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Obviously we had no real contact with my father in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I didn’t know where I was going to land up, they didn’t tell us, we were just loaded onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> and eventually we realized that we were on our way to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we’re then sort of detailed to work on <span class="DLF">railway sites</span> that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going out -- going off at <span class="NPIP">place-places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And that went on til September -- from April ‘44 to September ‘44. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Mainly in the <span class="REGION">Paris area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And then there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I’m sorry -- who realized that one day this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">The allies were sort of advancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then of course, what was going to happen then? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Especially towards the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and try to find the French Resistance movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Could you say that a little louder, I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  We jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Train</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Well, we -- no, what happened was that my other aunt in Dresden, my father’s sister, wa-was also married to an Aryan and she was allowed to send monthly food parcels to my grandmother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I -- again -- only discovered this now, that all they were allowed to write back by way of n -- acknowledgment, was a printed card which said, “Parcel received, we are well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They were not allowed to add any other information. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And once that information -- that acknowledgment stopped, we knew that they had gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  So probably after a few months, the -- these -- she must have died and my aunt was then moved on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The awful thing was that in one of these papers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I found that the official document says they were -- my grandmother and my aunt were aukershoben, which simply means -- it’s -- it’s a word that you use for cattle transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They were just shoved away. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I mean that’s how people treated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">That’s how they were looked at. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Not as human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  When did your father find out?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  That’s right, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And again I’ve only just sort of realized that had my father not found this diplomat as a sponsor, he probably wouldn’t have been able to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">He would have had the yellow star and what happened to all the other Jews, he would have been deported eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And we would have all moved into -- after some time, all the Jews were moved into <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish quarters</span> , where the Gestapo could kee-keep a close -- watch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And -- so we would have been --
