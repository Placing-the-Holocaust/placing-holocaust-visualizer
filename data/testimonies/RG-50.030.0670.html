<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">ANSWER:  — to get out of the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And here were the Soviets full companies, and still exercising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">I mean, it became clear eventually, the reason they had them there, because they had no jobs for them back in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And obviously it was safer to keep them a-at bay in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , than to bring them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">That  90September 12, 2012 was probably one of the main reasons they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">They might have had other ideas too, but the fact that they’d start another war seemed most unlikely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And was a very — I mean, it was a very easy job, it was one that I enjoyed thoroughly because I, for the first time had my — my eyes opened to — to the things which I — which wa —I would never find anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">We went to numerous <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , and concerts, and re-really took full advantage of whatever there was in — in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> at the time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">ANSWER:  The one of our dues — before I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we were involved with what was actually an army project, but we were there assisting, I guess, which was to collect scientists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">I mean, the army immediately began looking — I mean, as soon as they hit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there was a special detachment of the army which started looking for any scientist who had anything to do atomic work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1349">ANSWER:  And there’s a book written about that, which was quite interesting, the extent to which these people had to dig to find people, and to uncover the stolen and hidden  91September 12, 2012 art pieces, and other jewelry and — and — and — and mal — any — anything of value that Hitler, in particular Goring had stashed away in various <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">That was a special unit that just did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">But we were looking for scientists, and — and we didn’t have to look hard, we simply said, we’re looking for scientists, and they came from all corners of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1353">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">The idea that they might go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was enough of an attraction to — we — we practically had to shoo them away, and eventually we had so many people who claimed to be scientists and had really nothing to offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">But I did have one case, which I think was quite interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">It’s the -a—a-—a woman appeared, who was a very small — she was small stature, and her name was Hanna Reitsch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1357">QUESTION:  Who was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">ANSWER:  She was a topmost German test pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">She actually flew their latest developments in jet <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet aircraft</span> , and was obviously very valuable to our — our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">And for some reason she came to me, or I was assigned to talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And it was not an interrogation, these were discussions we had with people, because there was neither the time, nor the facilities for doing anything more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And as I was talking to her, she pulls out of her handbag, whatever she had, a huge medal, which was a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 93September 12, 2012 swastika surrounded by diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">There was a whole ring of diamonds, around a huge swastika, which itself was made of diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">It was just unbelievably heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">She gave it to me, and I held it and I looked at it, I said, I don’t want anything to do with this sort of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">I gave it back to her, and to this day I wonder what she ever did with it, because she took it, I’m sure, back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">She ended up in the United States, and she became a citizen, and I think a good citizen, and obviously was helpful to the aircraft people here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and she became a citizen, and I think a good citizen, and obviously was helpful to the aircraft people here in the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">QUESTION:  But how did you feel when — when it sounds as if, from your telling, that there was no punitive interest at all, in — from the U.S. military side, and the OSS, at least the arm that you were involved 1n, or the unit you were involved in, in catching anybody who would have — the word is war criminal, but who would have been involved in, let’s say the persecution of — of — of Jews, of civilians, or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">ANSWER:  No, you know, that-that’s an interesting question, because I — I could never find the answer to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">They — there were obviously teams doing that, I mean, the army had far more facilities and personnel to do that kind of work than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">I mean, our work was so specifically targeted against information that we needed, that the idea that these might be people who would be of interest for other reasons, or Nazis of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Not in my unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I— I do — I don’t speak for the OSS, because it  93September 12, 2012 was just too diverse, and there were too many different people doing too many different things, for me to say what OSS was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">I can only say my unit had this one task, which was to interrogate, or at least to — to get to know a scientist well enough to make a judgment whether it’s worthwhile to send him onto somebody more technically competent to do the interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And she obviously was one of those people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1733">QUESTION:  Well, is there anything else you would like to say that you would want — is there anything else you would like to say that you would want people to understand, either about what your experiences were, or some thought that you’d want to leave people with, or that you’d want your children to remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 4September 12, 2012</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I—I’m not very good about the idea of changing people, or that people are changeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">People are born with certain ideas, principles, and conduct, which is theirs for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">And I’m always surprised at people being able to move from one <span class="NPIP">religion</span> to another, or act in various capacities that they would normally not act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">But I do believe that the Jews kind of formed very early in life, and that you stick with those ways because they seem comfortable to you, and you feel secure in that environment.</span></p>
