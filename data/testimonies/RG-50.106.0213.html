ANSWER:  In 1938, right after the Anschluss yeah and I presume that after a while, even that way of earning a living petered out because we had no money after a while to the point that we had to eat in the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I discovered this only from the notes that Harris was able to get from the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> which has the records apparently of the Jewish council who were given the unpleasant job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> of deciding which Jews could leave and which could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And my father, when he went to the Jewish council, said that he could support himself because his skill was as a trunk maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That’s what he had done before he opened the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And he wanted to take with him in addition to his wife and daughter, his mother in law and his niece, Susan. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the Jewish council because they were limited by the Nazis couldn’t allow the, his mother in law who was over the age limit. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The age limit was 70 and she was 72 and they denied also Susan coming with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So Susan escaped with her mother and father and brother Max to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from there to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they were imprisoned by Klaus Barbee. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So they never made it and —

<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Yes that’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But then again it doesn’t hurt to lose a part of a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You just mature at an earlier age. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And you end up in having a certain empathy for humanity, whoever they may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So it’s not a lost childhood in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">You gain by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Also by being stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">You — I realize later what I do is what the Japanese call bushido, the warrior, the samurai will distance themselves from the emotion of the time so that they could fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">They would distance themselves from fear, anger and simply concentrate on what they have been trained to do and I find myself doing that in difficult situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I set myself apart from it, don’t allow myself to feel the emotion so that I can go through what has to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And that I think is part of my being a refugee from those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So that’s what I mean that it doesn’t hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It helps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  Gave you skills that you ordinarily wouldn’t have had if you were born here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  Right, it gives you an outlook and an inner and outer strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Inside may be turmoil but you don’t allow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">https://collections.ushmm.org September 19, 2013 31
QUESTION:  Well that was going to be a question I was going to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Are you two different people — someone on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and another person on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  I think I’m a unified whole, but Pve learned to control so if there’s anger at a situation it’s not anything to do with the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But if there’s anger in a situation I’ve learned to cover it up so that I can go ahead with what needs to be done, so there may be anger but I don’t show it. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Or there may be sadness and I don’t, try not to show it in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But does your question mean, am I in turmoil because of the two cultures that I’m straddling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  Yeah and the fact that you had to escape with your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Well I count myself fortunate that I was able to escape and badly that there were others who didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But we managed to escape and unfortunately others didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So there’s no elation over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">There are no extremes of feeling over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Simply an acceptance. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It is what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  Are you more comfortable around people who were refugees like you than people who were born in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Do you feel a connection to someone who —
ANSWER:  Well here I think I straddle two cultures again. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">For someone who’s European I do feel a certain connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I think there’s a certain behavior pattern of Europeans that isn’t American and yet there’s a certain behavior pattern in Americans that isn’t in European so you simply straddle the two cultures and it’s not that you’re a chameleon. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You take on the coloration. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It’s simply you have a certain empathy with these different cultures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  Comfortable with others who also came from Europe like you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">https://collections.ushmm.org September 19, 2013 32

<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  What are your thoughts about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Well I’ve always been pro-Zionist and certainly my belonging to Young Judea fostered, fostered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I feel it’s crucial that we have an <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because with our nomenclature of the wandering Jew hopefully this ends that period and I fully believe that the full extent of the Holocaust would not have happened had we an <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">A homeless, stateless people is a very vulnerable people. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And I remember reading about Hitler and the Armenians and when the Armenian, no one really came to the Armenian aid and Hitler said the world didn’t watch out for the Armenians, therefore we can do the same with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So I feel that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is an essential absolute necessity.</span></p>

QUESTION:  In other words, you go back every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  Because Harris mentors his group of students at <span class="BUILDING">Catholic University</span> and they go into this arbitration debating that meets in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> so that’s how we get back there each year. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Otherwise —
