<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  There was no name, just -- just <span class="BUILDING">haberdashery store</span> and I don’t remember seeing any name over a particular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Although, next door, there was my grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and she had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electrical appliances</span> and her <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">So I -- I don’t know why my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had no name. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> na -- <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ’s name was Znicz. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Znicz, Z-n-1-c-z in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and that means a flare or a -- in Hebrew, mare tahmid, a light forever, Znicz. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And that was my grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , which was next door to my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Okay, and you had -- your sister was older than you, or younger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My sister was older than I, five years older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And her name was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Her name -- the Jewish name was Malka Arahel. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Malka Rachel. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">She was commonly known at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as Mareesha.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Five years older, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">You mentioned in the videotaped interview, back in 1990, that your parents disappeared at certain points during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Do you remember what years those were or how old you would have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  I can give you approximate times. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">A-All I remember, actually, was the seasons of the year, whether it was cold or hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My mother disappeared, I think it was 1942 and it must have been July, or August, was very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I understand that there was a big German aktion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and that’s when she -- when she was caught in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and brought to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> , which was the -- the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , where they took all the people, to send them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I found out later on that people who were caught and -- that day, were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  So that was 1942, in the summer --
ANSWER:  Yes, 19 --
QUESTION:  What about your dad, was that earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  No, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">When there were the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span> opened up in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , there were different <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in different parts of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Where we lived, we went to work at the brush makers, making brushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And my father and my sister and I, we lived at the <span class="DLF">Narlefke Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">This was already maybe the third or fourth time that we have moved, since we were thrown out of our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My father went to work at that particular time and did not return. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It seems to have been an aktion and all people from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So he never returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea when that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  It must have been a few months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Must have been a few months later, can’t remember the date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Okay, so we’re still probably in 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Late ‘42, I would think, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And it was then after that, that your sister was captured?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Do you remember when that would have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  After my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I-It must have been -- it must have been the end of ‘42, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was an aktion where the Germans came into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and flushed out -- or at least tried to flush out everybody from their <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And at that time, we were 1n an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">street floor</span> , just a few steps going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And the -- We were left -- my aunt was left, my Aunt Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My grandmother was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My Aunt Esther’s little boy, who was about three years old, yeah, it must have been ‘42. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my sister and I. And when we heard that the Germans are coming in, we started hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy, went to a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> underneath the <span class="DLF">window</span> , which was used instead of -- instead of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And th-the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> were thick, so there was enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for those people to get in and I closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> and put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> in front of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And my sister didn’t know -- I -- we didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">folding bed</span> that when it was folded up, it looked like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And she crawled in there and I put a -- a cover over it and then I didn’t know what to do, the Germans were already in, so I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , but they looked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then I saw on the -- at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> -- on the wall of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , it was a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and on top of it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was also a light bulb above the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I don’t know how I was able to, but I really went up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and sat down on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> and unscrewed the bulb, making sure that no-none of my clothes hang down. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">By that time, I could hear the Germans in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , coming in and my heart was banging so hard I hoped they didn’t hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And that’s when they found my sister, and they took her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">At that time they didn’t find my grandmother, my aunt or my little cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But they did find my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Some people told me afterwards, some neighbors, that she was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I cannot recall -- I was in such shock, that I don’t remember what I heard and what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I just remembered that I heard her cry and they took her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They found her in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  And she would have been about 17, it sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  I’m curious, with -- with your mother and your father, your description in your videotaped interview was, they went out and they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I wonder what that was like for you, what you remember feeling, that you never really knew what happened to them, you s -- they just disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Well, where my mother’s concerned, we heard from her from <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">She managed to send word that she is there and asked [phone ringing]
QUESTION:  Before the phone rang, we were talking about yo-your mother and your father, when they disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Yeah, well we got word from <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> that my mother was there and she was asking for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And my uncle, at that time, tried to -- to contact some friends who worked with the police -- with the Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But, before anything could happen, we got word that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So, we know that she was caught there and that she was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And of course, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> left to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , that’s what we were advised. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">When my father didn’t come back, we did not hear anything, except that there was the aktion in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the people were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And this was, oh, I would estimate maybe two months or three months after my mother, because I remember the weather was windy. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I really had to judge everything by the weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I had no knowledge of dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was no calendar to look at. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I think that I was too young or inexperienced to -- to really remember dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Life there was like life of a rat that is hiding and it’s constantly chased. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And one does not know exactly where and when it 1s, day, night, summer, winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">This kind of sticks in the mind because it is -- you remember whether you were cold or -- or hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But the dates -- exact dates are not known to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Later on, when I listened to some people, who were a little bit older, even three, four years older than I am, they knew dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I have a friend who is 10 years my senior, she remembers every date and she has a terrific memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But I don’t remember the exact dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were thinking or feeling? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">You were about 12 now, a very difficult time --
ANSWER:  Yeah, 12 and a half, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Do you remember how -- what -- how you reacted when you found out about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">When you realized that first your mother, then your father was gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  I was in shock and I don’t know if I can -- if I can assign any thoughts to that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I know that I was in shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I know that the thought that was the most important, was survival and probably I -- probably I thought, “How can I survive without them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was actually a -- a selfish feeling, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It’s very hard to describe, I even get goosebumps when I -- when I talk about it, even now, because now I -- I miss them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">For all these years, I’ve been missing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But in those days, I think 1t was more of a -- of a self- preservation feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Of a, ‘What am I going to do without them?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And that’s all that comes to mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">What next, how to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Were you very close to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Very close to my parents, to my grandparent. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I was the youngest grandchild until my little cousin was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I was quite spoiled as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Had terrific childhood, very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I had good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , good teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I had everything I needed or I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I can’t imagine anybody having a better life than I did at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My sister and I, we were kind of spoiled children. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But I was even more, because I was the younger one, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  You mentioned in the videotaped interview that -- that you had made efforts after your sister disappeared to try to find her and I’m curious what -- what you did -- that you just sort of were never sure she was really gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I was never sure that she was gone, because I didn’t hear or see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And the efforts I tried to make would be after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I tried to put ads in paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Went to agent -- Jewish agencies to look for survivor’s names. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I wrote to the international Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I even wrote to them to find out if they heard anything from my parents, because I hadn’t seen them being killed and -- and -- and I thought that maybe miracle do happen and people do survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But everywhere I turned there was a closed <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There was -- Not a closed <span class="DLF">door</span> , but there was a ‘no’ answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Was this when you were in -- where were you when you were making contact in the papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  I was -- I started doing that when I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , tried from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , tried again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  And did they have any record of your mother at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , any --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  No records whatsoever, not that I could find any. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There is one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , very curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It -- It happened kind of in the last two or three years, that I came across a book of pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And those pictures were compiled by a professor from -- from <span class="REGION">California</span> and I contacted him and he said that he went to the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koblins</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where they have many, many films taken by German soldiers during the war, and the pictures -- th-the films have only dates on them, dates and <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but of course, no names of people or what th-they took pictures of. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I looked through -- through this book and I found two pictures where my uncle was in it and that’s when I contacted that professor and I wanted to know and that’s what he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He said if I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koblins</span> , the people there are very accommodating and I could look through any pictures I want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But of course, I didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I had a sick son, whom I lost since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  I’m very sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The uncle, whose pictures you saw, which uncle was this and where was he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  This was the uncle who helped my escape, as well as the escape of my grandmother, my aunt and her boy and his brother and the wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He helped us all escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , just as the Warsaw ghetto uprising started in ‘43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  And what was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  His Jewish name was Mordechai, but he went by the name of Mietek. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  And where were these pictures taken, that the professor had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  It seems to me that it was taken on the stage of a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There were two or three <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , one of which was familiar to me because my uncle performed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And th-the name of the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was Azazel. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I used to go there, almost daily to watch the performances of -- of the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , I used to love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I used to go there every day after so-called <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">There was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for us, but we had a professor who formed classes in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he was paid by my parent with whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Could be a pair of socks for his children or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he formed a class. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So some of us -- we started out with about eight or 10 children in the class and little by little, there were fewer, because they were caught, they died, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So, every day after the classes, I would run over to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and watch the performances. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, when I saw the pictures, I saw also the other actors, whom I knew, whom I met there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I tried to even locate them, but it -- it is not very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Although I was good at locating people -- I knew where to go and how to go about it, but those people I couldn’t locate. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, I recognize on the picture the stage, and it must have been taken there. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I would have loved to go there, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koblins</span> and look for more pictures and God knows whom I -- I could identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But, at that time, my younger son was very, very sick and I just -- I just couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I went away somewhere for a week or 10 days, I think to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and -- and I was sorry I did, because he couldn’t -- he couldn’t really look after himself, he was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And he passed away Friday the 13th of December, of ‘96. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So this Friday -- that -- this 13th of December that’s coming, will be two years that I lost him. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So I didn’t pursue any more looking and with me getting so -- falling apart, kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It’s -- It’s tough to -- to concentrate on everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  You mentioned that Uncle Mietek was the one who smuggled you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yeah, he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Forgive me for asking you a date again, but do you remember what -- around when that would have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It would have been in 1943, a little before or after my birthday, which 1s in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Probably was in March, maybe in April of *43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And then you describe that there was a period of you living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then at one point, you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And that would have been ‘44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Oh, that was still ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">When -- When we were at -- when my uncle smuggled us out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we -- he prepared, with the help of my other uncle, his brother and -- and her - and his wife, they prepared an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And my aunt’s brother made a double wall in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> without a <span class="DLF">window</span> and we could hide there. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So, if anybody knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> or anything like this, we would just crawl in and hide there until we were found out and of course, thrown out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  When -- After you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , after your uncle was shot, you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and you described that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was -- everyone was forced onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and you ultimately went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Well, that was a year later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  That was -- I would say more than a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">The -- The ghetto revolt was Passover of “43 and the Polish revolt was September of °44. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So, it was a year and a half later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  What do you remember about those two events? </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Yes, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I was working as a cook’s helper, in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> that’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jolybush</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">When the -- When the Polish revolt started in September, at that time, my aunt was across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pragga</span> and her little boy was on our side, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , take -- being taken care of by a Polish woman named Olga -- Ola. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I remembered that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I went to visit my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pragga</span> and she knitted a sweater for her s-son. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She gave me that sweater -- of course, nobody knew we were Jewish -- she gave me that sweater, I brought it to her son and by the time I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jolybush</span> , I heard shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And that was when the Polish revolt started, September of *44, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  And what -- And what was -- What was going through your mind at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="195">What did you think was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  I was not terribly emotional about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I just thought, this 1s a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Nobody’s after me, specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">This is a war, there were all kinds of rumors going on, because at -- at some point, we were -- we were bombed by the Cartushas from -- from the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And they were, I think, the Russian Cartushas. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And sometimes we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and shooting, lot of shooting, and there were some direct hits. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But it was a different feeling for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They were not chasing me because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was just a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And of course, we want to stay alive and we want to survive the war, but it was not the same as being chased because you’re Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  When you got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and you were being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span> , had you heard any stories about what went on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">You described that when you went to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , you thought that you would be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I was curious how you even would have known about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  We have heard that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , some time before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  They were -- It seems that there were some people who jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was very small, they -- they were tightening it all the time and rumors spread all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There were some rumors to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, when we were taken, in ‘44, as Christians, there was a thought about it, but the thought was immediately countered by a feeling that this cannot happen because I’m here among Christians and not Jews and they probably would not do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">At one time, there was a possibility to escape and I did not take that chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  When -- When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowed down and it was not part of the way, it was an half open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> where they keep cattle, in a half open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They -- Only later they switched to a all closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But at that time -- and it was still on <span class="REGION">Polish soil</span> , there was a -- a way to jump out of -- of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when it slowed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But I did not take the chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Why not, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Well, I was with my friend, Peppy. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We looked at each other and I think -- I don’t think we talked about it, but we both felt that this -- they are not going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And I don’t think I could jump or she could jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We were not that a-athletic. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So -- And it was just a matter of a short time when the possibility presented itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were -- were watched by the German soldiers with rifles, so no, we didn’t take the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Just like we didn’t take the chance to swallow the poison.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Do you remember being afraid on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , as you were going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But, you were with other people who were talking and -- and they never heard of dying or being gassed or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The mood was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It was like we know that we’re political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We were taken as political prisoners of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Because they didn’t know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  I want to ask you about that, let me just -- I’m curious how -- you -- you’d had to hide your identity, I’d -- I don’t know, did your identification papers say you were Catholic?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Yeah, Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">How was that for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You’d been raised in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Wh-What did that do to you, to be suddenly Catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Well, it meant to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I also went to see a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the priest apparently was very smart, because he told me that -- that religion -- God 1s for all -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Yes, I had -- I had gone to see him more than once and he was encouraging all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Sometimes I -- I thought that he probably knows who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Sometimes he would -- he’d give me some nuts and candy to take with me in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And he was very encouraging and very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Kept me going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Was there any -- Did you feel any conflict internally, th -- wa -- about having to hide your identity as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Absolutely, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I knew very well that I’m not supposed to be in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And yet for -- in order to survive, I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I had to do what every -- every other person did upon entering the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , put the holy water or make the sign of the crest or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Yes, I felt very uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But the thought of survival meant more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I just kept thinking, when I -- if I survive -- when I survive, I’m going to be who I am and not who I pretend to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I also know that Jewish religion tells you that life -- a human life is very dear and should be preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">People are allowed to eat on Yom Kippur, if their life depends upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So, I thought that I’m allowed to -- to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and pray, because my life depends upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It was -- This was my mediation in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Did the -- Did the religion -- Did that faith in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , was it a comfort to you, to be able to do -- worship in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I -- I think that my religion was my religion and whenever there was a speech by -- by the -- by the priest, it was a good speech, but I -- I can not identify with Jesus. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I -- Iam -- I wasn’t brought up that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I couldn’t identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But, in my mind, I would just substitute the word God. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I was praying to God, no names, just God. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And that’s what made it possible for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And this was my meditation, that I’m preserving my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That’s what I have to do to preserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Same thing with eating non-kosher food, I have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And that was the -- the power of survival is enormous -- is enormous. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I went once to a course, oh, years later, here in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Was a course of -- I think the power of negotiation or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Was given by a very good instructor. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And before the course, the instructor told us to write down everything we know how to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And people were writing and writing and writing and I just wrote one word, survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The instructor was not very pleased and she wanted explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But that was what I thought my main achievement in life, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It is -- That feeling 1s terribly strong, especially it was for me, I -- I -- I figured fo-for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And people did lot of things to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  What -- When you -- When you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span> -- on the video interview you described seeing writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in Yiddish from something.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  There were none, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The only way -- because Peppy could read Yiddish and she pointed out very discreetly, so that other people cannot see what we’re looking at and she showed me that there were Jewish names and I -- I don’t know what else was on it, but there were messages in Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  That must have been a real moment, I would think, that hit <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that had your identity been known, your fate might have been very different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Oh, we knew that all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We knew that all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We had to even be very careful sleeping, not to talk in our sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">When -- Because we were not alone, we were in big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And if we would say one word that the people don’t understand or they think it’s Yiddish or anything like that, 1t would be bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I thought later on, not at the time -- at the time it didn’t bother me, because I didn’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So I -- If I dreamed, 1t would be in -- in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, it didn’t bother me, but I remember it did bother my friend Peppy, who spoke Polish and Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And we had to watch each other, to kind of -- not to talk in our sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">There’s so many details when you -- when you want to hide under somebody -- to be somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Doesn’t pay, unless your life depends on it, 1t does not pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It’s a -- I-It’s a very, very 1-involved task.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Of 1944?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  1944, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And then they sent us out to the -- a -- a group of laborers, women laborers, we laid tracks for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So we -- They used to march us out with SS people and dogs and went to -- marched to -- to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they wanted us to put their <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We worked for 12 hours a day and then they marched us back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  You then went to something called free work and I’m curious if you had any notion of what that was, or --
ANSWER:  Yeah, when I said free work, I meant that there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That you living in freedom, that you can go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or -- or go where and come wherever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That it was not in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> not in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That is what I called free. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Although you were assi- | was assigned to a couple who owned a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> downstairs and they lived upstairs and I think they were assigned a slave, me, because they had a daughter who was an SS person. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I didn’t know it at the beginning, but I was assigned to this elderly couple and they were quite good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They demanded their work and they gave me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep and some food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They did not hit me, they did not treat me badly, so 1t was okay, except when their daughter came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were shaking, they were very nervous, and I didn’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Come to think of it, maybe they were afraid of her, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And when she saw me, that daughter, she wanted to know if I understand a lot of German, because it’s similar to Yiddish and if I can say something so that she could see that I speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Ma -- I don’t know whether it was my imagination or -- or it was for real, but she did a- ask me questions and most of the time I -- I just didn’t know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I could say yes, I could say no and -- or I could gesture with my hands like maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And she was quite unnerving me. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I think maybe she was doing the same to her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I noticed they felt much better when she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So that’s what I called free work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  When they announced that they were going to be sending you there, do you remember what your emotions were? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I mean, did you sort of feel like the worst was over? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Was it any kind of relief or did it not seem that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  They did not announce anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They just put you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and -- and got you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They didn’t announce anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">In the last minute, they say, “You are going be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">You are going to work here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they did not announce anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Said that we’re going to go out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We really didn’t know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But it turned out that -- that’s where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And it must have been -- must have been what -- end of °44, beginning of fort -- no, it was in ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was already in “45, because I remember being there not a very long time, when we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And we’re liberated in May of ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So we must have gone to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in °45, I assume.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  No, except that they talked to me like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Not all of them, but many of them would say, “You'll get yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You cooperated with the Germans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I never mentioned to anybody that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I was still afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So, 1-1t was tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It was very, very scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  And they left the couple alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Yeah, oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I suppose they left everybody alone after they took what they wanted and after they had a night’s sleep, when the fighting stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They seemed to be very excited, nervous, tired, hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They were the -- the front line soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  And it’s curious to me, they were essentially setting you free, but it do -- doesn’t sound like you viewed them as your ally at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Well, I did, in my head, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Because they -- they freed me from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So, I - I felt very good towards them, but they put other thoughts -- they had other thoughts in their mind about people like myself, who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Maybe they were told that this is the - the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Maybe it was their own idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I’m not talking about a whole regiment of soldiers, I’m talking about those who came my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And those that came my way, some of them -- many of them had that idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  It made me feel helpless. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And not knowing what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">What do I tell those people, no, you’re wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And all together, your -- you’re wrong assuming anything that you assume, because I’m not really the person that you think I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Couldn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I -- I was really upset and -- and helpless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  And you didn’t tell them you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Wh-Why didn’t you tell them that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Because I learned by then that nobody likes Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And therefore it isn’t going to do me any good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  So, even though they were the liberators, presumably they were not the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  They were not the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They were -- They were the liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I wish they could behave a little better than they did, but yes, I was glad to be liberated from the Germans, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I heard later on different stories of different people who were treated very badly by the Russian liberators, but I have not experienced that and I have not seen that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Treated badly how?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Oh, there are people who told me that they were mugged. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">That they were -- they were hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I hadn’t seen anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I -- I can tell you what I saw and I’m telling you what I heard, but I felt good to be liberated from the Germans and that was the main thing, but they scared me because of their thoughts of why I was spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Because they were mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I did not cooperate with Germans, besides, no German wanted my cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I -- I just rode out the waves of the war and I was glad that the war is over and maybe some peace will come and -- and I -- even then I hoped that I could find some of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">That was always, in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, I -- I felt good about being liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  And you went to find your friend, how did you get to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">At that time I would walk a couple -- a few miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">She was in a very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> a -- that -- ba -- at a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Th -- She was farmed out to the farmer from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And it just so happened -- happened that in that <span class="DLF">farm</span> where she was, I -- I came there to -- to be with her, because I was very much afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And then the Russians decided to be there to -- to take that <span class="DLF">farm</span> as their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So, 1-it was -- it was an unexpected event. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">However, it was not bad because by that time when I went there, she represented herself as my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So I kind of felt protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And indeed, I got a lot of protection because they knew that there is a mother and daughter, and that we were Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, it went much easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And those people who came there, the Russian military, not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They set up their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and they had Peppy work for them, interpret. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And Peppy said to them that she will be very glad, but to announce that her daughter is here and she is not to be touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And that’s exactly what happened, so I was protected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  And how long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  We stayed there not long. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Maybe some -- Maybe two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It was still not cold out when -- it was still summer, maybe deep summer, we set out to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Now, how did you decide to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Did Peppy decide? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Did you talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Oh, we talked about it, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And by that time we knew that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> there were armies of all the allies and we better get there as a first stop and then see if we could go back to our respective <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , to hope to meet our survivors -- our family who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was the first stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  And how did you -- how did you get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">How far away were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  We were very far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We had -- the farmer had a horse and the Russian found, in another farmer’s place, a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , which they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And what they did, they brought Peppy and me to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> on that horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And then we went on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  Well, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we wanted to s -- and we went to the Jewish -- society or <span class="BUILDING">Jewish headquarters</span> or what do they call it here? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The Jewish government kind of -- was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranyanboogerstrasser</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">The Yiddish Agaminda. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And at that time, it -- there was some people there and it was not excellently organized, but pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And there was -- there were some people coming and needing things and there were local people who manned that -- that -- what shall I call it, club, or the Jewish -- what do they call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The Jewish government, if there is such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Anyway, I was interviewed by one of the people there and when I told him that I was Jewish, he wouldn’t believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">He thought that I told him I was Jewish so that I can get a package of food, or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay from the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  United Nations Relief wor -- agency?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Which at that time -- I found out later it was bringing a lot of help, blankets and clothes and food to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for the DP’s, displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And this particular person that interviewed me was under the impression that I’m telling him I was Jewish so that I could get some of the goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Well, I had a problem convincing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And he asked all kinds of question and then he asked me to recite the shmisered, the prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I didn’t know the whole thing, but I knew some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Although -- he asked me the names of my parents and I told him the Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I told him my Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I had to recite the schma, which I did a poor job, but I did some. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And finally, reluctantly, he thought that I was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  That’s a curious thing, isn’t it --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  -- because you’d been having to deny that Jewishness --
ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  -- for so long, and here was someone who didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">How -- How did that register for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Ver-Very awkward. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Very awkward. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I had the same comment you just did. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I had to fight all this time to dispel from other people’s minds that I might be Jewish, and here I’m trying to tell him I am and he doesn’t believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Very awkward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  Where were you staying when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  We found Peppy -- Peppy found actually, an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of a young, German lady with a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Her husband, I think was a -- a prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And she had an extra <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So she rented us the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I don’t think we paid her anything but food. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Peppy made the arrangements, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But she gave us that <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , which was very nice and finally we could sleep in a -- in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , 1n a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , rather than all kinds of other bad <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So that was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Do you remember that first night, when you actually had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It was very, very funny, w -- because the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , th-the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , everything was very nice, but I thought, “Oh, I’m loo -- going to look around and see what it is like.” </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Well, I fell asleep like a log, did not enjoy anything else but sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  And you stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> about how long, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , let’s see, four, five, probably six to eight months, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  That’s a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  Why don’t we take a break here, the tape’s running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">This is tape number two, side A. We’re still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Tell me what the- what the atmosphere was like at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Was it filled with people? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Did it -- What did it seem like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Well, the atmosphere was chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">There were a lot of foreigners, many people, many survivors came. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">They were military of all <span class="REGION">area</span> -- al-allied groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And people are trying to find things -- find other people, find their relatives, find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, acquire some clothes, acquire some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was quite chaotic, but the allies brought in a lot of help. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">There was one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I remember, and in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , they had brought in blankets and clothes and some food packages I think, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And they were distributed to -- to people who needed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The German people were -- also were quite depressed and they needed some help, too; they had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">However, it was in a short period of time, there was -- a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Ill never forget that, it was called <span class="DLF">Alexanderplatz</span> and in -- in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you could probably trade for everything you needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You could buy or sell or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The German people would bring out their wares, maybe their clothes or their watches or whatever, to sell, to exchange for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The survivors were -- were looking for everything that they couldn’t get from the Jewish agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Oh, that’s the word I was looking, the Jewish agency, not government. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So, it was a time of confusion and people, being very eager and looking for things and for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Somehow, one tried to help the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It was a very nice day and I can’t remember what kind of a Jewi-Jewish holiday it was, it’s very hard for me to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">There was a Jewish holiday and Peppy invited the Jewish soldiers from the allied armies to come and celebrate the Jewish holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I remember they were Russians, they were Americans, British, French. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I don’t think there were any Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And whatever Peppy cou-could get in the way of food, she would prepare and there were candles lit and this was -- this was a- a thing that will always bring tears to my eyes, because this is the first time that people in different uniforms of different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and recited the same prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Whatever food there was, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Probably wasn’t much and probably some of it was that the allies brought in in cans or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">But the li -- the -- the candles were lit and all the different <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> , who couldn’t speak to each other because of the language barrier, they could recite the same prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And that was something that I will always remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  Did you -- Did you start going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> regularly? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Were there places to worship for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I did not go to worship anyplace at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I just didn’t know where I was, what I was doing and I was planning to -- to look for my family, if anybody -- and -- and I figured that if anybody survived, they’Il go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So, I wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and go to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived and see if anybody shows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Or go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish agency</span> and see if anybody registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">That was my first and only thought at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  And did you -- did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Were you able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  Well, I started. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I was on my way in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was held up by the Russians and all the foreigners were taken off. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I don’t know if the Germans were taken off or not, but all the foreigners were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and hold into the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And the explanation given was, that the Russians are going to help us go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Originally, I wasn’t worried, well if -- if the Russians are going to help me to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that would be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">That’s where I was going anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But, as we were put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">jail cells</span> , there were some people from <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And they told me that you really don’t go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they don’t send you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They send you somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , wherever they want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I don’t want to go anywhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And the mere fact that we were locked up and not let out, scared me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So this -- this person that was there told me how to escape, and I did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , there were several ways that ja -- that one could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">The Jewish agency, they had registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">People that came in from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , they would register there that they are alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">There were also soldiers from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Some of them took -- I asked them to put ads in the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">There was the international Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I tried to -- to reach -- to find where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">It wasn’t easy, because it was all chaotic and -- and it was all new established and some <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> there were before, were not any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But it was possible to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And -- And I put in inquires everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  Did you have any luck?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  None. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">There is one thing that -- one thing that came out of it is that after awhile the -- I asked a British person, who went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for vacation, to put in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> an ad, because my father had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with family, for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So, they put an ad, and sure enough, I found my uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  Which uncle is this?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  I want to get back to that in a second, but I’m still curious about one other thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Was it even anything as -- I imagine you would be walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> just looking at faces, trying to find familiar faces, and --
ANSWER:  All the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  I look at faces wherever I go, for 50 years or more, hoping to find a familiar face. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I joined the [indecipherable] the Warsaw ghetto resistance organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , because for awhile we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So I joined them, and every time there was a meeting, I would just go there and stare at faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I didn’t find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">A friend of mine find -- found friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The one that 1s a little older and she could remember better, or maybe her friends didn’t change as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I didn’t find a soul that I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  What is that like when you’re looking at faces? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I mean --
ANSWER:  Very disappointing, and the question is here, look at me, don’t you know me? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It’s not as if I am supposed to know you, because I am a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It’s that you are supposed to recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Without realizing that this is not possible, children change faster than adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Didn’t realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Don’t -- Doesn’t anybody know me? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Nobody knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Even if they did know my parents, they wouldn’t recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So this looking at faces, whenever you are at a Jewish gathering, is something that I do automatic, wherever I go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  Well, your next stop after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , what was that and how -- how did you decide where you were going? </span><span class="sentence" id="698">How did that get figured out?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  Did you know that you were going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that had been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> during the war?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  It felt like a temporary assignment, like a temporary thing, because it was in the back of my head still to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to find relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I thought about that most of the time and it felt like this is a good stop, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stop and wait until the opportunity presents itself to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to find my relatives.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  There was a -- an <span class="REGION">estate</span> , I think the Varburg estate. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And they have arranged for us to be there to -- to transform it into an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and we were brought over there, so it was beautiful, it was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And from there, we were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Now, in this time, when you were at these <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , did you -- did you have any kind of boyfriend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Not really boyfriend, but developed friendship with a few people, girls as well as boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  Yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">These people you’re still in touch with, besides the -- the nurse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  Some people, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">One of them brought a book, and when I got there now to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , there was a copy of the book for me, with her writing because she couldn’t come to meet me, she was going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a seminar. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So -- and I was so sick, I read the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I was surprised that I could still read Hebrew with -- without punctuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I haven’t done it in a long time, but slowly it came back to me and I read her book about her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And then I went to visit my room mate and she invited a few people from the same group, who came to visit and brought pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So, it was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">QUESTION:  Th-The children, or young adults -- you were, at this point, I guess 16 -- 15 -16, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , did you tell each other about your experiences di -- during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Did people talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">The main thing was 1-if -- when you made acquaintance with another survivor, the main questions was -- were, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you go to? </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">If the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was the same as that person, then they would compare notes to people they knew or the -- the bad guys or what -- what it was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But, this is how people got acquainted, what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were you in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  Did you see a lot -- any evidence of trauma, of people who were really scarred after the war emotionally or physically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  We were all scarred. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">We were all scarred and I think that this 1s going to last a lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I thought that I can always point out a person -- a survivor -- from any group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I can do that, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Because we have a scar. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We have a certain way of behavior, a certain way of speaking or behaving that points to the fact that we’re survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">That’s in my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  When we change <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , I want to ask you about that a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">This is tape number two, side B. You were talking about being able to recognize survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Tell -- Tell me what you mean by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">What do you -- What do you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  I find that we survivors have a certain way of speaking, of behaving, that I don’t find among other people, who never went through the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">That’s how it seems to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">We -- We can compare -- We can compare to each other, but we don’t have the good times that other people talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">There’s some among us that block out the -- the happenings during the war, although it was just a few years, but it left a big scar on everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And even, it -- just like in the Jewish religion, whenever there is a holiday, there is an eeskar. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">That’s the prayer for the departed. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I find that whenever we have even the greatest simcha, which 1s a celebration, we always remember the bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And I find it many times in people’s eyes, in their voices and behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I’m not trying to analyze, but it seems to me that I can recognize people who are survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">QUESTION:  Other kinds of survivors, as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I mean, if you were to find someone who’d survived <span class="COUNTRY">Cambodia</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> or any other sort of mass slaughter of people, do you think it would be the same, or is there something unique?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  Well, I can only speculate on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">My speculations would point out that yes, you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Because people who have such past, where they suffered a lot, they usually behave in a milder way, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">But that would be just speculation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I think where we left off, you were -- you had just left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , you were in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in -- oh, I wanted to mention one more thing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">You had mentioned a woman, Haddassah Rosenzaft, who was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  Tell me about her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Well, Haddassah Rosenzaft, when I met her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , her name was Haddassah Bimko. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">She is also a survivor -- was -- she passed away since. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">She was in the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and sister the -- we call her Sister Hela, the one I spoke about before, the nurse, sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Everybody called her Shustra Hela. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Polish, shustra means sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">She knew Dr. Bimko quite a lot from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they were apparently saving a lot of children in Bergen-Belsen camp during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And Dr. Bimko was very helpful in securing things that the children needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Hela was in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> all the time and also trying to help out. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Dr. Bimko did not reside there, I don’t think so, but she was in different committees to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  Do you have any strong memories of her, of things she did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I remember that she got married in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> to ros -- Mr. Rosen -- Mr. Rosenzaft. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Was his name Joseph? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I don’t remember -- Yosela, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I can’t remember his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I used to -- to know it, because it went together in my mind, but something happened to my mind since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">She married Mr. Rosenzaft. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And then I met their son. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I think he was born in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ., </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Menachim Rosenzaft. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Dr. Bimko, well Haddassah Rosenzaft, she traveled with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , to bring me to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , to do the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It’s -- Actually, she contacted me and she made all the arrangements for travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And we flew together, there and back, so we could talk a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And then we were 1n touch on the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And then, one day I went to visit Hela in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and she told me that Dr. Bim -- Dr. Haddassah Rosenzaft passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  Had either of the two of them, over the years, mentioned Anne Frank? </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I’m wondering if they knew her at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  No, no, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I don’t think I knew that name at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I think Anne Frank came from a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , she went to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , that we -- the people from our <span class="REGION">area</span> did not go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So, I don’t remember hearing anything about Anne Frank.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So you’ve now left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , you’ve gone to another <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  And then -- How is it -- Did you decide where you wanted to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Did you know where you wanted to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Well, actually, the whole group was talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">We had some people from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> come. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We had even from the Jewish brigade, that joined the British army, they were stationed somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And they send us gifts for Hanukah, with letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Each one wrote a letter to the kids and another roommate of mine got a letter in her package and she did not want to respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">She gave it to me and I responded. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Developed great friendship with a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">As a matter of fact, I visited him, too, and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">First through the mails, and then, when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he was discharged from the for-forces, he came to visit, so we could meet in person. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Also, some other members of the Jewish brigade came to teach us. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">They formed a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They taught us English, math, whatever we could, whatever they could teach us and give us and do for us, they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  Where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  That was -- It started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and it continued in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blankanasa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And then later on, when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we stayed in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">The tape I mentioned before, of the reunion, has one of them giving a terrific speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Couldn’t recognize him, because he’s all gray and when we went to visit Hela, she had copies of the same pictures that I had and I showed my son and daughter-in-law this - this particular soldier -- he taught us I think, math. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">No, he did not teach us math. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">For math, there was a Mr. Kaplan, Shopdike Kaplan. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">He taught us math. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">This particular one, Alleeyahu Benyuhuda, I don’t remember was -- what he was teaching us, but there were classes and there was another one, Mr. Schwartz, Aria Schwartz, from the Jewish brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We kept in touch with them all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">They came to reunions. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And the reunions happened every five years now. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I don’t know if there is another planned, because we’re getting old. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We’re getting old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  Well, how -- how was it decided then, that you would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, since we were in a group, and we had all the influence of the Jewish brigade, we also had visits from Golda Meir. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We had a visit from Ben -- Ben-Gurion, who came to talk to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">There was no doubt about it and no question about it, that that’s -- we’re going to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  Tell me about those visits. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Where was this and what -- tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  Well, the visits happen in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and of course Ben-Gurion came to talk to us in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He talked to all the survivors and of course, we were there to hear his speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So, 1-it -- 1t was very, very -- how to say -- it was ins-inspirational. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And, after being treated so well, and taught -- we were taught the alphabet or Hebrew, there was no doubt about it, there were a few people who -- who didn’t -- there were maybe a few people who didn’t want to go or had found relatives, I don’t know, but the whole group -- it was decided for us and nobody objected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  Tell me more about that speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Do you remember what he said, or how -- what -- what were you thinking when you -- did you know who he was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">ANSWER:  I didn’t, originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Originally, I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And the speech was mainly about -- about Jews having a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And that -- that we’re this -- he came to greet the survivors, invite us to build -- to build <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> -- it was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and 1t was mainly an invitation to come and help them build. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">This was before the state was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were feeling when you heard this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">ANSWER:  I don’t remember, really, how I felt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I thought it was a good vibration, it was something that, oh yes, let’s go and do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Although, all the time, in the back of my head was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and find family and then maybe go together with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I was not -- I was undecided, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But it didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">This -- There was freedom, there was enough food, there was what to wear and nobody chased me. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And that was good enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  Where did -- Did Golda Meir come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">What was the --
ANSWER:  Golda Meir came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> too, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  Together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  No, no, at different occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But I hadn’t heard her speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Sometimes, when -- when things got a little organized, they were having -- they formed commissions and -- and different organizations and they had everything indoors, and it became not as outdoorsy as at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Maybe the weather also interfered, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">But later on, we could -- we knew that somebody was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but not necessarily -- we were not necessarily invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But you did hear him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I heard -- he spoke in Yiddish, I could understand it, but this was not my language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  But I could understand what -- the gist of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Years later, I found out that I can speak Yiddish, too, which I never tried before, I never knew I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But I could understand because my mother and grandmother, whenever they didn’t want me to understand something, that’s how they spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So, maybe that’s why I -- I could understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Later on- years, years later, I found out that I could speak it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I tried and it went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Were you concerned that you’re going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> meant, in some sense, that you were giving up on finding your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">No, because you could find people wherever you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You could write letters, you could teleph -- well, telephones were not that popular at that time, but you could always write and there were always people who traveled and they’re helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">They want to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So, you could ask somebody to place an ad in the paper or I could write to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , whether I am in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So, no, I was not fearful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And how did you get to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">ANSWER:  Oh, we -- we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in a -- 1n a great big, old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , by the name of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Champalion</span> , which afterwards sank. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Yeah, we went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was packed with people, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to lie down or sit down, just to stand up, almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">The trip was not very comfortable, but we were moving across the at -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mediterranean</span> , towards <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and we got there and the British put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> again, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atleet</span> , there was a camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But we were 1n -- not too long there, and we were assigned our destination and we went to -- my group went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kayata Navim</span> , which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">QUESTION:  Had you ever seen water like that before? </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Had you ever been to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  I don’t think so, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I have hardly traveled -- when I was a child, I hardly traveled out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , just for summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">My parents used to rent a <span class="NPIP">place</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was reachable within an hour, so that my parents could come out for the weekend to be with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And that was the extent of travel I did before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  Do you remember any impression once you were on the Mediterranean of seeing what you were seeing, or seeing <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the first time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  If I was lucky, I could see it, because there were so many people around, you can’t even see out. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Th-Th-The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> -- The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was really full, because among us who -- who had legal papers, there were many more who were just smuggling through. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So that’s why the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was so packed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And there were how many of you together, the group that you were with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  Well, we were 80 in our group from the -- from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  And tell me about your impressions when you first arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  I remember being in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atleet</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span> and it was terribly hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Was very hot and I did not have a lot of clothes to wear, ex -- but I did have a little coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And it was too hot with the coat and I couldn’t take it off, because what I was wearing underneath was -- wasn’t good. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So I remember that, suffering from the heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">But, as I said, we did not stay there long, because of the fact that we were children and we came legally, we were assigned our respective <span class="NPIP">places</span> quite quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  And do you remember what -- when this was that you came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , what the date would have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">ANSWER:  I have -- I have a document there that tells the day -- with a picture, you should see that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I think it was April, ‘46, 1f I’m not mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">QUESTION:  So you’re 16?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1245">ANSWER:  Well, I wasn’t looking for chances to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">As matter of fact -- and right after the war, for quite a few years, I couldn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I remember when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and my aunt and uncle wanted to talk, I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">It was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">It took quite some time to be able to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">It -- The whole thing, it was such a humiliating experience, to be chased, to be -- to be at the target of somebody who wants to kill you because why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And the way we were treated by the Germans, it was so humiliating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">This wa -- This was probably what they wanted to do, so that we can forget that we’re human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">It was very humiliating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">It was very tough to -- to reverse that, to say well, it is not what anybody else thinks, we are people, we have feelings, we’re -- if -- we’re not better, but just as good at least, as anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Took a long time to -- to get back to what I call, to normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Maybe that’s the reason that I can recognize survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">There is something that tells us, oh, we’re all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">We’re okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">We’re not what the Nazis told -- told the world that we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">We’re a people and some of us are -- are really nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And then, when you think about it and you read about it, we have given the world quite a few good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So, I don’t think anybody should hate us, but that’s my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">That’s my opinion.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">ANSWER:  I can’t tell that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I think you have to ask my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">But, very often, when I hear or read about people who have difficulties communicating with their mothers, usually mothers and daughters have problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I can’t understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I simply cannot understand that and I cannot see why that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Well, maybe there is a reason, but I don’t know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  Why is that, do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">The -- The -- That that’s your reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  I really don’t know, but if I were to speculate, I would think that maybe the both parties want to -- to impose their views on the other <span class="NPIP">party</span> , whether it’s mothers and daughters or vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I find it possible to express my views to my son and not impose on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">He should know my views. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">If I wouldn’t tell him, it wouldn’t be fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">He should know his mother just like I would like to know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">He would know my views, but I don’t impose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Maybe those people try to impose those views, one upon the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">I don’t know, but that’s how I would speculate it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1305">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you -- I believe you had gone back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for the 50th anniversary, tell me about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1403">ANSWER:  Women’s movement, in my mind -- in my mind, women should get paid the same if they do the same work as men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Women should get jobs that they are good for, just like men should get jobs that they are good for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">I don’t think that they should be chosen on the basis of their sex, but because of what they can do on a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">That’s what they should do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">But, I also believe that women are different from men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">So, some of those movements that you mention, don’t fall into any category. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">I would pull out -- some points out of it and say, where work is concerned, it goes by ability, who is able to do what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Should be doing th-that thing and get paid the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">When it comes to personal lives, women are different from men, period, no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And as -- as such, we have to behave as such and we shouldn’t change our behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I don’t like to see boys walking around in dresses or -- or -- or -- or girls wearing man’s suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">We are -- I feel that in private life, in personal life, men are men and women are women, should act as such and behave as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">That does not mean that it’s a woman’s job to cook the supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">If he is a better cook, he should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">If he comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> earlier from work, he should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">It is sharing, it 1s -- 1t is equality in where it counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">But we’re -- we’re not the same, we’re much different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And as they say, vive la difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">I believe in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">But I’d like to get paid as much as a man if I do the work that a man does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1423">QUESTION:  Great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">I think we can stop there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">I want to just give you a chance, if there was something else you wanted to add, that I didn’t get to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1426">ANSWER:  I don’t know of what I wanted to add, because I didn’t plan on what you’re going to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">Pll be glad to answer any questions if you have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">If I can, I will answer, be truthful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">But I really don’t know what you would like to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">To encapsulate 50 years in two or three hours, is very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And I’m sure that when you leave, I will probably think, oh why didn’t I say so and so or such and such or explain this event or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">It’s very hard, but it might happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">So, I’m glad that I could answer some of what you asked and if you have any more questions, Ill be glad to -- to supply my answers, however poorly they may sound.</span></p>
