QUESTION:  We’re sitting in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheboygan</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">It’s a little bit warm, so we have the <span class="DLF">windows</span> open, in case you hear a little bit of traffic <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , or kids playing, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">A lot of kids playing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> around here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Sorry, couldn’t predict the weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  That’s okay, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Let me just have you say your name, and where we are today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My name is Fela Warschau. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheboygan</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> , on 2407 North 12" Street, and the day is June 11", 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  A very sunny Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">You’ve already done two very comprehensive, very eloquent, actually, interviews for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  -- on -- on video.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes, I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  So, in our interview today, we’re not going to go over as much of your wartime experiences, as you have in those videos, those are --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  -- pretty complete. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So -- But what we want to do today is talk about what’s been happening to you since the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And I’m just trying to think of a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to pick up. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">You’ve told the story of the day of liberation --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  -- and you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And, you know, one question I had, which you didn’t talk about specifically in these interviews, 1s the final days of the war, the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were just deplorable. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And you and your sister --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  -- and two friends --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  -- were keeping yourselves alive with one potato.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes, but we also came -- we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , having a li -- a portion of bread from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , from a -- from a so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was a sub- camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And it -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , everybody knows that, but somehow we got transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , with this piece of bread yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So we ate first this bread, and then this potato, but it was just impossible to -- you know, we were losing our strength, and could barely walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So, it is true that we stayed alive with one potato, I don’t know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to the end, we couldn’t walk any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Went in in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to lay down, and to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">This is when liberation came. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the walking around typhoid fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I wasn’t that severe, my sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She had to be taken away to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and she was very, very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">When -- When she got well, I could hardly recognize her. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">She looked worse than the people that were dead in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But somehow, you see, we survived, and we didn’t find anyone of our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was very heartbreaking, and at this point it seems pointless to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There was nothing to go on for.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  On the -- On the -- the actual day of liberation, as you talked about in your video interviews, you had actually, I guess, gone into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and y-you --
ANSWER:  Gave up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  You were going to die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And one of my friends, she -- she wanted to -- to just walk out, and sort of a last farewell look at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and came back and told us that was funny things going on out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I just said, “Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You hallucinating,” you know. “</span><span class="sentence" id="45">Let me die in peace.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">She kept on nudging, and my sister went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I don’t know where my sister got the strength to come back and grab me by my arm, and tell me, “Get up, you have to see what -- what is out there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I just didn’t think I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">No, it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I thought I died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Did you think it was some sort of dream?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yes, sort of like I was watching, you know, this isn’t really happening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But it was real enough, and we were liberated by the English army. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was heartbreaking though, that so many people, those living pe -- skeletons that couldn’t walk any more, you know, getting bread, and couldn’t make use of it any more, because that too late for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  You know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  The -- The question I had about all this, because you have talked about this in -- at some length in your other interviews, is if the British hadn’t come right then, if an allied -
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  -- military force had not arrived somewhere in that period --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  -- to liberate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> do you have any notion how much longer you might have lived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Maybe a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Because maybe I wouldn’t be starved to that point of dying, but I completely gave up, because I thought there was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There’s nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Sooner or later, we all will be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">This is the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, just giving up on everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">No food, no water, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Nowhere to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There -- There -- Outside the barbed wire, there was kohlrabi -- I probably mentioned that too, the piles kohlrabi that were decomposed, that people there still risking their lives to get one of those squash things, a smelly things to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  What are those? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Kohlrabi, what -- what is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  It’s like -- What can I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It’s a thing that you used to feed animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I know it was -- in Europe it’s called kohlrabi, I don’t know how to translate this into English, up to this day, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But that’s supposed to have been the people’s food. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was warm in April, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The sun was beating down on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The kohlrabi was decomposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so desperate to get this. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I was a very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">If it wouldn’t be for her, maybe I wouldn’t be alive, because she worked in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where she had more access to food. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And she always used to smuggle into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> some of it for me, which was a great help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  After all that you had been through for all those years --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  -- and all that happened to you, why is it at this particular time -- you say you had given up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Why do you think it was at this particular time that -- that you started to feel that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  You mean, after I was liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  No, just before. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You said you had, you know --
ANSWER:  Because I could see that there was no hel -- no help coming from nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Where do we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Surrounded by <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and dead corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And you walked around, and -- and people were just dying right in front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What was waiting for us? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The same thing, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So it’s just -- you might as well, sooner or later, because there’s no other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  But you had -- didn’t you have indications that the Germans were losing the war at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Oh yes, we know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We know they were losing the war, especially when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , then we were still working there on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Th-The fliers, the Allied fliers, they were coming three, four, five times a day, and we worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Like it says in my interview, next to a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span> , we could hear that radar turning and beeping, and the sirens going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We could -- We could hear the bombs flying, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was one rubble on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That’s the way it looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So we knew no -- no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in condition -- in condition like that could win a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It was impossible for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the question was, are we -- are we - will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That was the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was going, and -- and how long you thought it would be before it ended, before it was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  We really did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It -- We were so absorbed in trying, first to survive from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We did not see a tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">That’s what it was, just trying to survive every day as it came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  So things like what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> with the bombings, and the --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  -- other things you saw, they were sort of -- you would see them, but it was almost like that was kind of the -- the background --
ANSWER:  Yes, it --
QUESTION:  -- to just staying alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  -- it wasn’t touching us, just this is it, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">This may sound like a silly question, but how long can four people make one potato last? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You --
ANSWER:  Would you --
QUESTION:  You talk about this one potato.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Would you believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We made it last almost three or four days, just eating -- you could look through that slice when we were eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I don’t know w-what kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I honestly don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">People say, oh, you were destined. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">God was watching over you, that you should survive and be able to tell that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I really don’t know what forces kept us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It’s just impossible to tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Before you started eating it, how big was the potato? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Well, I would say it was quite a nice size, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  You’re showing about four or five inches there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  I would say --
QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  -- something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Oh, okay, so, you know --
ANSWER:  How she found it, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I say it was a miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It must have taken a lot of willpower not to eat more of it, at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Yes, it did, but it seems like we were always the ones that had this willpower. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When we went to work, we got our portion of bread in the morning, some people ate it right away, they were so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my friends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have the reassurance that I have something to eat for later. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We knew nothing else was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">St -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one time -- you worked for a couple weeks in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kronst</span> , and we were loading bricks on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But that was also -- you had to be lucky to be picked for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so 1t was a great big fight in the morning to get first in <span class="DLF">line</span> , to be picked for this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We were always divided in different working groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Most of the time, a majority of the time, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Before liberation, at the end, you -- you talked about, in your video interview, how the- there were, you know, still, of course, you know, German guards there, but they were wearing surrender armbands, and --
ANSWER:  Tho-Those were not German guards any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Those were -- They’re volunteer militias from the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lithuane</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and they -- they had white armbands, we could see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And those people were still shooting at us, when the people tried to get those kohlrabi, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I can’t understand their logic, and their way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  In those final days, were there still any sort of selections going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  That had stopped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Not where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , were like several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> together, divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">That much I know, because if -- we were with others, but not -- I didn’t even know that children survived there, in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We di -- We didn’t know that, because we were not together with these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  So in the end it really wasn’t -- the killing that was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not the -- the organized systematic killing, but it --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  -- but things were still happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  I-It -- Things were happening, and they didn’t have to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">People were just dying, because they didn’t feed -- s -- the people that were there previously, they probably weren’t fed for the longest time already. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So, that was just like -- they were self- destructing, they didn’t have to do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  When the British came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and one of your friends came in and told you to take a look, and --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  -- you started to see these scenes, and you weren’t sure if you were dreaming, or if it was real, again you’ve talked about all that in your video interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Do you remember your first contact with any of the -- the British soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Not -- Well, we -- they ge -- they handed out food. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">This is all I ru -- I remember, being close in contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I also watched them later, right away film that liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They were putting it on film. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I know there is a video of it, 1t’s called liberation of Bergen- Belsen. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">This is exactly what they did, right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And next thing I know, when we were sort of already settled, and they came in -- I don’t know, they must have been Scotchmen, or whatever, they came in with their bagpipes and skirts, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I was sitting on- on the <span class="DLF">curb</span> , and I looked up, and that’s the first time I’ve seen a man dressed like that, in a skirt, and I just laughed so hard, I could hardly catch my breath, cause I didn -- never saw anything like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you and your sister said to each other in the first moments, when you realized what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  We were just overwhelmed, and then my sister started feeling very sick, and we tried to get her in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> there, there were just makeshift <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , and the people were laying just covered up with sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Not enough doctors, and do you know, the German population from around, they were forced to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and see all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And the English needed help with the sick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn't even want to come in, they had to be brought in at gunpoint. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They didn’t want to come and help the sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It took me a long time to find my sister in those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I didn’t know where they took her. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Finally I found her, and there she was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water to her head, and she said, last night the doctor said to her -- he looked at her, and he said, “This woman has the crisis tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">If she’s al -- If she survives, she’Il be alive tomorrow morning.” </span><span class="sentence" id="191">She said, “I didn’t sleep a whole night, I wanted to die with my eyes open.” </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Here I come in the morning, and thank God she was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Then they first started giving her medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Medication was so scarce that they only gave it to people they thought would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">That was the case of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  What was your sister’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Helen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  And is she still alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Yeah, she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Yeah, but she does not care to talk a lot about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There’s certain people that don’t, my husband especially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Before we move on, maybe you could give us the names of your various family members --
ANSWER:  My -- My --
QUESTION:  -- and a little --

<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  Well, in Europe, most of the time the Jews had no rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I would say we were called citizens, but we had no right, we were always second class citizens, as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">When I was a child, you could hear em -- being said, Jew, Jew, all the time, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And even my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was always good in languages, you know, always got the best grade in Polish language, so our teacher, an educated woman would say to the class, ‘“Aren’t you ashamed that this Jew has the best mark in Polish language?” </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So we were always aware -- always made aware of it, that we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Ya -- In <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , you were not believable, because you were a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">If anyone had something against you, you were lost, unless you could bribe the judge, or whatever.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  What about your husband, did he stay in the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , or did he move around some?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  No, he -- he changed, because thank God, that first <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> we b-barely -- we chased the rainbow all the time, very poor hours, very poor pay, but then, thank the lord, they went on strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">That was the turning point. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Nobody knew when this was going to end, so I urged him to go and look for a different job, and then he found another job, which was much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">If he had that job in the beginning, I could have gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learned something, but then, by that time, we had children going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So we wanted them to go, we did, the both of them went to <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , we saw to that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Most of the time we were just -- there were a couple of other survivors, we sort of circulated among ourselves, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I was -- I would say I wasn’t even invited any <span class="NPIP">place</span> with the local people. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I -- I don’t know about the others, I just know we weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And most of the friends that we made, we were invited, were not even Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We had a lot of Gentile friends right away in the beginning, helping us a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And like when we bought this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here, actually we hardly had any payment, and people helped us paint it, and remodel, and do everything, without anything, and those were not Jewish people that helped us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Why do you think that happened, was it just sort of accidental?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I think the people here, themself, weren’t that well off before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">The war gave them opportunities to better themself, and maybe they were busy themself, trying to get somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They were just so absorbed in their trying to make it, that they had no time for anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">That’s the only way I can figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I have a note here, this is from the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that I -- I guess maybe you mentioned this in wa -- one of your other interviews that you had, most of your friends here were not Jewish, and it says that you said you think that’s the way it should be, and they want to know what do you mean by that?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Do you remember that? </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Saying that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  That’s the way it should be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  I said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Well, because I think we need to communicate with people other than Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I had a great need to understand about other religions, and about other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , because in Europe we were completely isolated from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And I learned a great deal from my friends, they learned a great deal from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And we you learn to respect one another, because of that, and it doesn’t matter what religion they are really, we are always good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We do --
QUESTION:  With your friends, your non-Jewish friends --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  -- during this period, did they ask you much about what happened to you during the war, did you talk about it much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  Some of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And some of them said, “Don’t talk about it now, it hurts too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Maybe later on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And finally, I don’t know how -- it started with me talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Do you want me to talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I don’t know, do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Sure, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Well, there was a time when they were speculating about Dr. Mengele, because he was the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , doing all the experiments, if he was still alive, and that was in 1985, where that was a big uproar all over the world, trying to figure out where he 1s, or what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And the local paper here, wanted to write a story tying in some one of the survivors with Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">The only one that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> here, was I. So someone directed a newspaper lady to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">She came and interviewed me, and we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I did tell her that Mengele met every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , or, at that time, I wouldn’t know who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But I’m sure he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So she took my life story, she wrote a big article, and she said, “Tt’ll be in the paper.” </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Made headlines, you know, it made -- the next day it made headlines, and I started getting phone calls from <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Howard’s Grove</span> here, that asked me to come and speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The teacher -- And I said to her, “T don’t feel like coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I have never spoken in public, and I really -- are you sure you want me to come?” </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So she said, “Of course.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="741">You know, my first presentation was maybe 10 or 15 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I was shaking in my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But from then on, apparently I did something right, because she keeps on asking me to come back every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">From then on I keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And from then on, from word of mouth, other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and it gets to be more and more every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So, that’s the way it happens with me going out and speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  How often do you do it now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Soon as <span class="BUILDING">school</span> starts, I get phone calls, and I would say in an average, about five times a month, for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But sometimes it’s even more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  These are <span class="BUILDING">grammar schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  Well, I did not tell them a lot when they were much younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The only thing that I always instilled in them, that we are all people, and it doesn’t matter who we are, everybody is a friend, if they’re nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And they were like that, they made easy friends with non-Gentiles, and gen -- and -- and Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">My kids had tons of friends coming to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">They had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , very little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because this is what we could afford, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was small, it -- as a matter of fact, it had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , because I couldn’t fit in two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But they always had friends, and some of e-even slept over, in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- in that jammed <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because they liked to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So it was always happy, and full of kids around here, when they were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I wa -- I was happy, too, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Once they left, it was very traumatic to get adjusted.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  Well, we just tried to tell them that -- we had to tell them, you know, because they used to ask about grandparents, other relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So this is what came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">That’s what we had to tell them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  They would ask where their relatives were, or why they didn’t have them?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="828">QUESTION:  As the years went on, and they got older, did they continue to be curious about it, did they ask you to tell them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">ANSWER:  They did, but when I sometimes expressed fear, they always said, “Oh Mom, you’re living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , don’t worry about anything here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="830">They felt very secure here. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">First of all, my older daughter, she was a little baby when we came, and my other daughter was born here, so she never knew about, you know, being -- bu -- she -- the other one didn’t know either. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">She only said in the beginning, “Oh my God, I’m a German citizen, how terrible.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Because she was born there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  What about you yourself, when it would come up? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Did -- Would you prefer not to think about it, or not to be reminded of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  Well, in the beginning, none of us really wanted to talk a lot about it, because it brought a lot of heartache. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">It still does. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">It -- That will never go away, as long as we will live, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Beca -- It’s hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts, and you’re a 13 year old girl, and the war ends, and you’re an adult on your own, and there’s no one to turn to for advice, what to do, how -- what to do with your life, or how to -- to associate with people, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So it’s very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">My young years are gone, from childhood into adulthood. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">It’s -- It -- It is -- A lot of the people can’t understand that, what we missed out on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  Do you ever have dreams about the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Lot of dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  Do you remember certain ones, or --
ANSWER:  Sometimes I dream I’m there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And it’s not like I’m in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but I’m trying to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">They’re coming, I’m trying to hide, and every time I’m hiding, I know they coming near to find me, and I’m running, trying to find a different <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I’m running that far, one time I was running so fast I woke up, my heart was beating so fast, I could hardly catch my breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">This is what woke me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">There’s many other dreams, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  Do you still have dreams today, about --
ANSWER:  Once in awhile, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  Do you think that -- obviously, you know, in many ways it’s a good experience, do you think that it’s been a good thing that you’ve become a bit of a public speaker about the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Has that helped you in any way, sort of sort things out, or deal with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">ANSWER:  Well, La -- I’m very gratified that I do something good, I think I’m doing something -- bringing a little understanding to children, and some adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And believe me, some 0 -- some of the adults, which I’m very shocked, until I come, say they never heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Would you believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I had one college girl come over and say she never heard of the Holocaust until I came and spoke there. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">This is gratifying, very much so, and another thing, I think is -- when you speak about it, it’s just like therapy, talking it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">At -- It feels like I’m talking my heartache out, and after that 1t makes me feel I’m a little more calm, because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It gives me a better feeling, trying to make people understand what was it like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  Do you read much about the Holocaust, and what about films, and documentaries, and that sort of thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">ANSWER:  I have tons of books on that subject, and documentaries, I have several. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Also, I went to see “Schindler’s List,” of course, and there’s a lando -- on PBS, there’s a lot of documentaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I try to watch, but sometimes I don’t any more, because I get very bad dreams, and sometimes I can’t fall asleep any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">You know, the older you get, and because we are retired, our minds are more activated towards these happenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And especially something like that, it triggers so much, that you can’t sleep, or when you fall asleep, there are many nightmares.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  Do you -- Do you feel that what you lived through, and what you saw, had any great affect on how -- you know, it’s a big question, I guess, maybe it’s too big, but how you see the world, or -- or how you see other human beings, or just humanity in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Do you think that you saw things one way before the war, and it was drastically different afterward, or what -- what’s that been like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Well, as a Jewish person, before the war, I knew -- like I said, I knew I wasn’t equal to the others, because I wasn’t treated that way, but I always felt I was, in myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">It wa -- It was instilled into me by my parents, that we are good people, and we did not do anything wrong, it’s just too bad that other people can’t recognize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But when I came here, I rejoiced in all this freedom, I also look very cautiously on everything, because of the things that I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I’m always a little skeptical, and afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I’m still afraid, because of what’s happening with -- with this mushrooming groups of hate, what is going to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And if they wouldn’t someday prevail. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">This is what bothers me a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION:  I imagine you’ve returned to Europe.</span></p>

QUESTION:  How do you feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and Poles and Jews in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  Well, I feel like that they say they suffered, it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Polish people were also exterminated, but they were not exterminated, some of them, for the same reason, not because they wanted to exterminate a race. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They did it because they were afraid of uprisings. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Th-They did it to political people, and whatever they -- like I always hear homosexuals, or whoever went, they’re going against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">That’s why they did it to the Polish people, the intelligentsia, that they shouldn’t be sort of wising up the loc -- the population to revolts. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Those they exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">But especially for the reason, just to wipe out a race, they didn’t do this to the Polish people like they did to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So, what I would have to say, that -- in the respect, they didn’t lose what we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">They still have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , where we got to be people without <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I wasn’t in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> last time when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I felt that I didn’t want to go and see the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because I always felt bitter about this big martial plan, where I said, we sat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camps</span> , with nowhere to go, and here all these millions are being poured back in the perpetrator of all these atrocities, making them prosperous, where they sat <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in their own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They lost people in the war, they lost <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">People got killed in the bombings, but they did it to themself, they have no one else to blame for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Still they had a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , they had mothers, they had fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And here we were helping them back, to get back to wealth, and here, we that lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And they shed our blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We are sitting in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camps</span> , with nowhere to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I felt very, very bitter about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  Come on, anyone that compares this to a Holocaust doesn’t think straight, because <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , those two factions, are people that have their <span class="REGION">land</span> , and each one is fighting for possession and power. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">They fighting each other, right, and it’s -- they’re shedding blood, which is unnecessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Things could have been resolved peacefully, but people are too hateful, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I am very upset about children and people being killed, but don’t ever compare this to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">The Jews had no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we did not start a war with -- start a war with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">We were citizens of each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we lived in, and this is -- we tried to live peacefully, we had nothing against anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We were simply killed, and tried to be exterminated, because we were Jews, simply. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">The goal -- Hitler’s goal was to exterminate the Jewish race. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We were not fighting for property, or for a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">We did not have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987"><span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , and the Serbs, they have <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They lived side by side each other, and each one wanted to dominate, and this is what started it. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">They fought one another, okay’? </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And they -- Whatever happened there, it’s their own fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">They brought it upon themself, I feel sorry for all the people, for the -- like I said, for the little children -- innocent children -- innocent people being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">When I see that, I get very upset, because it does remind me of World War Two, and of the killings, but you can never compare it to the Holocaust, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  What about the argument that some people have made that of course this isn’t like the Holocaust, but if <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had acted when whole populations were being persecuted in the past, then a lot could have be-been avoided. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And this whole notion that now, you know, something should be done, and it shouldn’t be permitted, do you -- what about that argument?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">ANSWER:  You sort of -- You have to have something to believe in, otherwise there’s -- there’s nothing to live for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I -- I think you have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And it’s not that I justify what happened, but then you start thinking, and you think there have to be some powers above, that are still ruling this world, and why this happened, I will never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So there -- there’s so much mystery in this world, and a person has to believe in something.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">ANSWER:  I -- I think most of the time, I encountered good people, and through my traveling, I met a lot of people that stick to me, and are friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">We’re in touch, they come and visit me, they invite me to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And I’m very happy about that, most of them are schoolteachers, and all these other people that -- and when I say -- sometimes make comment that I’m amazed, you know, educated people like that, they really want to be my friends, and they answer me, in a ways, you are more educated than we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So, I feel very humble, you know, that -- when they tell me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And I -- The only regret may be living in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Right now, I don’t, because we retired, but when I was younger, I figured, if we would have been in a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , maybe we would have had a better opportunity to better ourselves financially, because in bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , there were larger committees, and there were other ways the newcomers were treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So, I don’t know, maybe we would have been better off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But then, you don’t know the language, and you don’t -- you don’t have money to move around, you just stay where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And once you're settled, it’s hard to move.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">ANSWER:  My mother used to tell about inventions, people discovered this, or that, or made some gadgets, you know how they work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And my father was always busy working, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we had to work many hours to make a living, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So he had no time to read the paper, and my mom used to sit next to him while he was working, and read the paper to him loud. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And then when she read about something like that, she should -- used to shake her head, and said, “Only in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , things like that could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">This must be some wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And lada -- some of the people that immigrated before the war had relatives sending back letters, and telling him all about the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> here, and all the things, what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So she always thought it was a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, and I was very much impressed by it, and that was always in my mind, what she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">When we had a choice of going places, I always wanted to come here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">ANSWER:  Oh, I would say very much so, because you know, we lived on a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where everything was primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">There wasn’t running water, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flush toilets</span> , there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And I came here, and saw all that you could have, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerators</span> , you know, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas stoves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">There was never anything like that when I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Running water in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a -- a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and <span class="INT_SPACE">bathtub</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where we had a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tub</span> , you know, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So, I thought it was wonderful, oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And even now, when I sit in my <span class="NPIP">dreams</span> , such foolish things, I try to imagine I’m talking to my mother, that she’s sitting next to me, and I’m saying to her, “Look Mom, how wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">All you have to do is press a button, and your clothes gets washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Can you see all these wonderful things that are here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">It’s just my mind always thinks back, and I’m trying to carry on a conversation with her, in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">QUESTION:  But was there -- was there anything you missed, is there stuff that -- or some aspect of life that -- that you had in Europe, that you feel is -- doesn’t exist so much here, or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">ANSWER:  Well, I would say, in the beginning maybe not, because the closeness with the families was always there, even in -- and the other people’s lives here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">People were much closer in families than they are now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Children and parents were together, things were done together, and I was always invited to people’s <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and to dinners, and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Everybody sat down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , the children were there, our children were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And s - § -- conversing afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn’t have, it was compensating very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">The only hard time was when it came to our holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">So, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and you thought of the wonderful times you had at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And all of a sudden, all of this is gone, and that’s what it is, hard facts of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Is there anything else that we haven’t talked about, that you’d like to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">ANSWER:  You know, off-hand, I can’t think of it, but probably by the time you’re gone, I would say I should have said this, or I should have said that, and that’s what probably will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I just -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who think time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that 1t should be left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don’t have any grandchildren, it’s hard to take this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">They just elected to be career women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Yeah, I would like to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I compensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know about it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And many <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> also tape me, and they have that on their files. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And I go, for the fourth time, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">Marquette University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And they always tape it, they considered this a lecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they file in their files there, so that -- that’s something that I think is very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  You know, it -- it has been so many years, and the people who did the live through it, who are still alive, obviously are not going to be around forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1130">QUESTION:  -- are gone, and whether the memory will persist, or will it be forgotten?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">ANSWER:  I think maybe for awhile it will persist, but I’m afraid with time, it might just be something in the archives that now and then, someone will look it up for some reference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">This is the way it probably will be, sadly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I say that very sadly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">In the beginning, maybe, the first several years after we are gone, it will be still carried on, but later on, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">That’s what I think will happen.</span></p>
