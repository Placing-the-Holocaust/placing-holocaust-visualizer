<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  So religion was an important part of your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  I would say it was a vital part. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh I can’t classify it as important because there were a lot of things that were important and the presence of religion and in the 1 2 family the Friday evening um service was important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh it gave me a very nice feeling that when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> one year, um I um was a professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was a Fulbright professor at the University of Belunga in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And um one little episode I will share with you which is a great joy to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Um a welcoming uh party was scheduled by Abba Eban and Sonya Marabach head of education in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh and I was to be the, the guest of honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Um the taxi driver said to me well where are your flowers, this is Shabbas this is the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Where are you where are your flowers, where is your gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I don’t have any flowers, I didn’t buy any candy, I didn’t buy anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I just wanted to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He said well usually on a Friday night, it is expected that you bring some flowers to your host. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Um the taxi driver didn’t know where Abba Eban lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He knew the general <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> but didn’t know the exact <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But he stopped some young people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he said to them, I remember very clearly he said well you, you must have made some kind of relationship with these people from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And I said well we did the best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">All the <span class="BUILDING">florist shops</span> were closed because it was uh between 4:30 and 5:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They close early and I’m sorry we, we had nothing to, to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So the taxi driver uh dropped my wife and me off at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of these officials from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and about 20 minutes later, the doorbell rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And the taxi driver stepped out with a big bouquet of flowers and he handed them to my wife and he said here when you go back in there you will have a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">You are not supposed to go in there without a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You should bring something to your host. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And so I asked him how much it would cost and he said there would be absolutely no fee at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It’s my pleasure to be delivering you to, to have delivered you to the party and to see that as guest of honor you were well received. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And so uh everyone was very excited about the fact that the taxi driver brought in some flowers because it was Friday night and uh he felt we should have known, we should have remembered but it was our first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> so I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But the taxi driver made sure that all the passages were open after that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  It was not a Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There were uh a number of Jewish families living in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Uh I would say that we were happy together as a group, playing sports, singing and music, being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , um doing the kinds of things that kids do in a. in a <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I was lucky in being the chance to go to <span class="BUILDING">Boys High School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , kind of a well known <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Um with lots of um talented people running the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was very delighted to be a student at <span class="BUILDING">Boys High School</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  And no feeling of being different because you were Jewish or anti-Semitism or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No feeling of that sort whatsoever, the, the sports were mixed with the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The sports were mixed with <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The sports were mixed with music. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The <span class="DLF">ports</span> were mixed with whatever activity was going on in, among our small group and for that reason I think we got along very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Were sports an opportunity for everybody to be together and get to know each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  It is, it 1s an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Sports is a way in which you can get to know each other, in which you can um be happy together, be distressed together when nec, when it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">To understand more about the Catholic religion, the Protestant religion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> which serves its clientele and it was our responsibility, my mother and father taught us to be together and uh it was, it was a fine, it was a fine way to do it and my father had a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> everyone needs nails and screws, hammers, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lawn mowers</span> , it doesn’t matter what religion you are, if you need a tool, you need a tool and so I learned a lot about the exchange of information, exchange of equipment tools, um how to make keys, how to fix locks, um |-o-c-k-s. How to prepare uh door checks, how to prepare things that needed repair that my father had taken in for repair and I was taught how to participate un that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  So it sounds like to me that you were an all American boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You weren’t necessarily just from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I mean your identification was just...
ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I’ve oh I’ve never felt either on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> or the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or with one collect, connection or another connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I felt that we were together, our group was together and we had a lot to enjoy together. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And it did occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Many of the young people in, in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were admitted as students at <span class="BUILDING">Boys High School</span> , which was I have to say it, a very elite tough <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you had to work very, very hard to remain to succeed and to get ready for <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your sports activity, what you liked, how good were you. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">3 4
ANSWER:  Uh in my younger years there was no such thing as a little league baseball or Babe Ruth league baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh fourteen managers and 26 assistant managers uh and somebody in charge of the Pepsi cola and someone in charge of, of something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There, there wasn’t that kind of uh relationship that uh the grouping was, was not hard and in that way um my parents were aware of and permitted my participation in sports so I had to balance out the hours I spent in sports with the hours I gave to sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And um it was uh a good way I think for me to learn um importance of earning a living how different ways exist for earning a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And uh participating in certain projects regardless of what background you come from religiously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  What sports did you like? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">how did you get started?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Uh well one way in which you get started I guess is by having things close to hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My father had a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> but it also had a sporting goods branch to it and so I was allowed to go pick out a pair of ice skates. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was allowed to pick out a pair of roller skates. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I was allowed to pick out a brand new basketball and go with a team to a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was allowed to uh pick for myself and my Dad sold many of those sporting good items but it wasn’t pushing me into sports in order to sell a few more gloves, a few more bats, a few more balls, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my Dad liked them very much too and that’s why it was such a surprise to me when I played baseball in the Canadian American league, professional baseball on opening day when um the team I was playing with the Rome Colonels, Rome New York Colonels, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity that no one really ever gets automatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And that was my father coming secretly and I don’t mean secretly in a secret, secretive sense but in a personnel sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he came up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , didn’t let me know, stood behind the <span class="DLF">dugout</span> watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome Colonels, watched his son play. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">After the game was over had dinner with his son, and a couple of his son’s friends from the team and after dinner he got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> to his <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Kind of a homey sequence but that’s what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And uh most of...
QUESTION:  Followed your career.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  That, that started it yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And as a handball player, tennis player, um I never had golf clubs, we never had that kind of money to fill out all the sporting goods that exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But that was one, that was one way to do it and the competition that came from sports relationship angles uh was very important kind of experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because I, I learned to live with the competition, to lose when I had to lose without crying about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">To win when I could win with joyousness and to share with my teammates other, other kinds of experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The last thing I would say in this regard is that that may have been the reason why when Little League did start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> I started it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And got the teams together uh got the, the parents together, got it, got it started and then we went off to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I 4 5 played catcher for <span class="BUILDING">Boys High School</span> and then catcher for <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was on <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> when I was selected for the Olympic team. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Um.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  ...how you really got into baseball, did you love it, how good were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Well I was it was not a great competitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I was a good competitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I worked hard at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I had all the moves necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I was a catcher very early and being a catcher eliminates a lot of people from vying for that role. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">How to hold your hand, how to make sure that the fingers are in such a <span class="NPIP">position</span> that when you, when you went to the minor leagues you didn’t get whacked and have your fingers broken there or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And so it was an attempt to be able to scoop the ball, learn how to scoop it without injuring your fingers and that took some doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Um so my sports really came from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> from being a catcher at <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the Olympic tryouts were held in 3 <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , in western state Michigan College and in the <span class="REGION">Baltimore area</span> and there were hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying for the <span class="NPIP">spots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">There were 21 places on the Olympic team, 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And there were maybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying for that, those 21 spots and I was a catcher selected uh by the coaches for the Olympic team from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , from the <span class="REGION">east coast</span> tryouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  You must have been pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Uh I worked hard at it, I worked hard at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I knew what I was doing and uh wanted to be a catcher right from the beginning and catching is so hard and so difficult and uh it, it’s one of the positions in sports where injuries are more likely to happen because of the close activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat and your fingers don’t always give that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Um and so I went off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , went off to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> , became an athlete on the Brooklyn college team, went to the Olympic tryouts, was selected for it uh and then had my chance very happily with meeting up with Hank Greenberg, the uh first baseman of the Detroit tigers who that year was being shifted from first base to <span class="DLF">outfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh and I talked to him about some things that were going on that I felt needed adjustment and he gave prompt attention to what he thinks he, what he thought he could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And he did some things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  ...g0 back to the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">While you were playing baseball in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , were you ever thinking in terms of Olympics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> you couldn’t hope and dream for something that didn’t exist, there were no Olympics in the <span class="REGION">baseball area</span> , there just weren’t any. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was track and <span class="DLF">field</span> where Johnny Woodruff participated, sprinters, jumpers, runners, uh long distance athletes uh you can think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You can dream about it and you can measure yourself uh side by side with other athletes and begin to think of your own chances and you try for it and you shoot for it and by shooting for it and 5 6 at some of the materials that um may become available to you, you will see that uh I worked very, very hard to try to get that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  What you’re saying is that while you were playing baseball in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> it hadn’t occurred to you that you might be going to the Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  ...complete thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  What, what I could say is that the uh thinking about playing in the Olympics as a specific activity compared with uh playing baseball with a semi pro team with a neighborhood team, with a college team, far differed and thinking of playing baseball in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , uh and getting a bid to be on the team, all of which were helpful, um and I was lucky to be one of those selected and as I said they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> , <span class="REGION">western state Michigan</span> and the <span class="REGION">Baltimore area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Did a coach or somebody at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> suggest that you go to these tryouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">How did this come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Uh the coach at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> uh at which I, I earned a silver medal in baseball when I was very young, 16, 17 years of age um kept pushing just said go ahead, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Uh yes he wanted me to, to keep trying out. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Um I gave more energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I spent more time in practice I worked harder with my teammates. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And um when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , there were 2,300 athletes in the competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And uh you were tried in all the <span class="NPIP">positions</span> , sliding, hitting um throwing. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Uh doubling, triple activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Uh all of which I knew something about...

ANSWER:  ...for over a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  How did exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Are you ready for the answer now. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics really started because there was an American committee on baseball that was pushing very hard for baseball to be introduced and attached to the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The uh number of baseball players in the world were limited pretty much to Central American teams, to all the American teams of course, South African teams uh the kinds of athletes who got started early through films, through television and began to play at a very early age. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It really got introduced because 6 7 frankly and I don’t take this as a compliment for myself, because of Herman Goldberg who was in charge of developing baseball in the country of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  I want to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  So the United States Olympic committee decided that they were going to try to promote baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A; They were going to try to promote it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Who came to this decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Judge J. L. Hoffman of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> was the one who headed the group that pushed very hard for baseball to be an Olympic sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Also the American Olympic committee wanted to see baseball in the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They had seen uh ski jumping; they had seen all the other sports and they really wanted to see baseball in there and 1t came about because the committee of the various sports, finally agreed that it would be a good thing for American baseball to be on the calendar and as far as I can tell that’s when it started because I began to get mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I began to get the first uh pieces of information about the possibility of a baseball tournament being held.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  And so it must have been pretty exciting to be in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  It was very exciting because well first of all the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> was very large. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">125,000 people watching a baseball series, unheard of, unheard of before. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Most of the baseball teams in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 maybe but 125,000 who ever heard of such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You heard of it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for the first time and it was promoted by the small group of 28 baseball players. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There were 28 of us assigned to play a series of exhibitions against each other and then go out into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and demonstrate baseball to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , to many <span class="BUILDING">German institutions</span> , how it’s played uh what the difference is between baseball and soccer, uh what the rules were. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">How the umpires played, played the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Um it was done um because of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I was very proud to be a part of the group that kept pushing without pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We kept encouraging, encouraging, demonstrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">This is how left handed first basemen behave, this 1s how right handed pitchers do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">If you are left handed this is how it’s done. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And um we, we put it on the map.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  What was the reaction when you were playing these games in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">What was the audience reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  The audience reaction was very poor, very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They didn’t like the game, they didn’t know the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The <span class="DLF">diamond</span> , the <span class="DLF">baseball diamond</span> was never laid out 7 8 like a diamond. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They took a four inch white silky tape and they pressed it into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And they made a, a, a uh diamond out of it for baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But they never actually made a <span class="DLF">baseball field</span> , never. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It caught hold to some extent, not to such extent as in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , especially <span class="REGION">central America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But it became a vivid activity because it came from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">A lot of the kids wanted very much to know more about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and the sports were very important to them too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  But the audience was not excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  The audience was not excited because the pace of baseball much slower than soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">In soccer the, the ball is moving, moving, moving, moving, moving all the time and the kids are kicking you, and they’re kicking you, they’re kicking you and they’re circling and they’re beating out the other guy whereas in the the sports you play hard or you jump hard, you, you run hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You do all of the things yourself, but in baseball you’re part of a team. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And it’s necessary to uh understand that and uh the crowds on the <span class="DLF">baseball field</span> were 100,000? </span><span class="sentence" id="194">not 125,000
QUESTION:  ...the period before you went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">How much did you know at that time about what was going on in Nazi Germany?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  I knew less than I guess I am told I should have known by many people who asked me how come you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when this was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The uh number of Jewish athletes, sort of about 8 or 9 out of 328. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Um the number of Jewish athletes who made the team and then quit 3 or 4 of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Knowledge about what was going on with Hitler beginning to come more close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Um. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">One of the most telling experiences that I had personally we’d lived in a small <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Mine happened to be named <span class="BUILDING">Brandenbourgh cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Because Hitler had charged money to all the dead residents of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">To pay for his <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> and then they, another group paid for the, their, their named <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Another group paid for this and I can recall very vividly the um concern I had when I went down and I saw a big chain at the <span class="DLF">basement door</span> of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">There were 28 players who lived in the Brandenbourg dorf in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and uh what I saw in the rear of the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> was a <span class="DLF">door</span> and another <span class="DLF">door</span> and then a chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I opened the chain and I walked, started to walk downstairs in the bottom of a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And there was a big cavernous area. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I didn’t know what it was for but I sure found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">That it was for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer tanks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> because what they did was declare the Olympic dorf, and the athlete and the military chiefs were housed where the Olympic athletes were housed after the Olympics were over and I was told by a woman who took care of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Raus, raus, raus, get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Get out of there, get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">She didn’t want me looking down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I didn’t know what was down there but it turned out that 1t was large enough, the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> or the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> whatever you want to call it, in my, my <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> you, you find these picture material that was brought to the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh you will find uh structures that look like <span class="BUILDING">resorts</span> but when you walk down there, the <span class="INT_SPACE">cavernous</span> , they’re empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They’re the thick the uh the cement was about 10, 12, 8 9 15 inches thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And that couldn’t be for just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Something big had to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> that had <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> this thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You never saw such thick <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and uh it turned out that that became the west point of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 
QUESTION:  At what point did you realize this was what it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  I realized what it was after I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and after I had seen enough of the activity that led to uh the early movement of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> people into army men and from boy scouts into young soldiers and from ordinary men uh with ordinary credentials, carrying shovels, dressed in regular clothes but carrying shovels ready to clean out as soon as the American athletes left, ready to clean out what they could from there to get it ready for the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  So you saw this as you were departing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  I saw this about half way there. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I would say about 4 weeks, 4 weeks before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I saw it and they were very strict very angry because I, I was the only one who went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and it was just a happenchance walking down a flight of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , we were moving a chain and being yelled at by the German hausfrau and house man who didn’t like what they saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I mean American down in their property, that was going to become a Panzer tank unit as soon as the games were over.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Um, about 2 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  So I’m sorry but I’m a little confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">When you say you saw people coming in with shovels getting ready to transform the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">This was while you were there for the Olympics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Yes and the materials that we found by our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , they were very large books marked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Just the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and in that book were pictures of men marching in parade but they weren’t equipped with Army uniforms, they were equipped with regular clothes, with work clothes, with uh seemingly baskets and then shovels on the shoulder and they were walking this way, this way, this way through the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> there and uh what we found out was that they were not only being prepared for their part in the Olympics, but some were ready on, on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Ready to be instructed in how to go ahead and um fill in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> that were going on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  How odd this is that they would leave this for you to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  How what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Odd this is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  How odd? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Well I, I would say it would be stupid first, odd yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">An open <span class="DLF">door</span> down to a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> that had no use other than for storage of large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Uh that’s of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  So before you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , you didn’t know too much about Nazi Germany’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  That’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Now there was some movement in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> um in regard, regard the boycott, were you aware of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I was aware of some of the activities that were going on throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in different parts, there were programs which uh um displayed the feeling about uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what was happening, what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Hitler’s preparation um the uh um activity going on in the in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , in the manufacturing areas, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> the construction, all of those things were, were apparently going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Also uh the American athletes and all other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had its athletes separated by action and by that I mean by what, summer sports, winter sports, differing kinds of activities trying to separate them and you could see that uh if you opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to look into <span class="NPIP">places</span> and the house man and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> frau caught you, you’d get yelled at but they didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They didn’t want to hurt anybody and they didn’t want to give away their, some of their secrets about their, their non relations with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Um that’s one of the one of the I, I think first, first time he ought to be aware of what 1s surface, the surface on, on a cottage game. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And uh if he has another chat we should have the chat, we should have the chat, we should not be afraid to have someone here telling us how he or she feels about what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It may not get it all so smoothly. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">You may or you may and you have to work it out to find out what, what is going on that is happening with the Olympics that you are part of it, you’re really not part of because somebody else is running it now and you’re someone else in a cotton uniform 10 11 ready to run uh for the next period of 3 or 4 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I, I’m not sure what else I can say on that particular topic. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I may have, I may have messed it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  ...a sense of before you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Excuse me one minute...boycott in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , were you aware of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Uh yes I was somewhat aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The press gave some <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to the problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> not full <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Not full uh description of what might be going on underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It wasn’t that kind of a, a fullness of expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But there was enough information coming because Hitler was beginning to, to make demands which were so great and impossible that you, you had to have a feeling that you were into something that was going to be very, very rough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Was there talk about a boycott, about not going to the games?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  There was some talk about it, yes there was and, and a lot of the talk was directed at the president of the American Olympic committee, who I think gave very little preliminary credence to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But he wanted to see what was happening and he as an old time pole vaulter from <span class="BUILDING">Yale University</span> and the head of the American Olympic committee behaved in such a way that um 8 or 9 of us who were Jewish were, were not in the games. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I was there because I was working with a demonstration group, not a competitive group at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were striving to teach enough skills so that they would say next time around, we want a baseball team, we want a baseball team and didn’t happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">QW: So you were allowed to play in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> because you were in a non-competitive sport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  I think that would be one reason that the American Olympic committee chairman uh Norman Armitage uh did not have any feeling against me or against Jews that he was visibly going to show.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Did you think before going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> as a Jew that maybe you shouldn’t go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Not for one minute, absolutely not one minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I talked with a number of the sports leaders in our <span class="REGION">local area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I talked with the coaches at <span class="BUILDING">Boys high school</span> and uh I told them what the goals were and I was not discouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I was not encouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I was just say well, here’s your chance to learn something and I did not speak German but I uh began to use some of the German that I knew in some of the discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> was about 12 miles from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Marty Glickman and I were headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Berlin</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Um we were interested in two things, one uh a boxing match that was going to take place that day and some other events about uh kids who uh were in difficulty but uh were good athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Now in the first instance that I mentioned uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> we had missed and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that ran every 30 minutes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">If 11 12 you miss the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> you are out of luck for the next 30 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And so Marty and I were headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Berlin</span> and we did not make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We were late and so we went out on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and we put up our thumb to get a ride, dressed in the American Olympic uniform, we had no trouble being picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We were picked up by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> um athletes in uniform, German army men actually, in uniform with a sidecar, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> with a sidecar and Marty and I got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sidecar</span> and he drove us we were almost through with the 12 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And I asked the question, I asked the driver of Boxinyaki Vilsen from Veronica Staaten, from <span class="REGION">North America</span> right. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Is Jackie Wilson from the United States of America going to be boxing tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Yako Wilson from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> going to be boxing tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Huite, Heinte, I use the word Heinte, the Jewish word for tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Instead of Hoyte which is the German word for tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">If I wanted to know are all of you going to the movies tonight, hoyte, are you all going tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So I didn’t say it the right way.

QUESTION:  From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> did you ever travel around or go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and have any unusual experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Yes, there were opportunities to go from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> uh every 30 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> arranged for the athletes from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I can recall one event when Marty Glickman a friend of mine from <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> had an opportunity to go downtown together and we went on, we went out on the <span class="DLF">road</span> ready to thumb a ride into, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and uh it the way it worked out was that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German jeep</span> uh or a, or a with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sidecar</span> came by and saw our thumbs out waiting for a ride and so they stopped and they invited us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We went in, into their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> and we moved along very rapidly and at one point in the ride, the German driver said to us um can I see your uh passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Your (autograph?) </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And he said to me can I see your autograph also in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And uh we had them with us but we didn’t think it was their right to have them and so I went beyond that and I said um, uh tell me did will Yaquie Wilson from Veronichastaten from <span class="REGION">North America</span> be boxen heint, I was really speaking Yiddish, the word heint meaning tonight and instead of saying hoyte which is tonight in German, I said heinte and so that aroused their concern somewhat and um they asked us to stay over on the side of the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They talked to us a little bit, much of which we couldn’t understand but they asked for our autographs in spite of the fact that they were saying to themselves, these are two Jewish athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We were dressed in uniforms so they knew what, what we were doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Uh the uh opportunity for knowledge of other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> would be helpful to them so they asked us for our autographs but being stopped on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , driving along with him and then being stopped to be asked uh what, what your autograph, what your number was and then linking that to uh, a request for an autograph was unusual, that did happen yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And it was frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">12 13

<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Uh no there were, they were not, they were being very careful to uh keep those hidden from direct public view. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There were uh some evidences where um news people news syndicated people, syndicate people wanted to see if there were troubles going on between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because of the existence of Hebrews on the American team. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And uh it was clear to us that they wanted those signs down and so there were some <span class="DLF">ladders</span> maybe 4 to 6 feet tall that I noticed very carefully and there were men and women on that ladder corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">13 14 Uh directing whether or not those people were going to stay on that uh were going to move away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There was no smooth sailing. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was dreadful to think of what might be coming ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You couldn’t quite tell everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Um the preparations for athletic events, the preparation for musical events, et cetera were all things that were good things and you couldn’t tell immediately that there uh anxiety over seeing what they could do to Americans could be completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Did you have any other experiences where you were alarmed or felt that there was danger or that this anti-Semitism was rampant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Yes, there was one series of events where I felt that the uh some news syndicates in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> who were very anxious to get evidence that things were not going well for American athletes and that they would like to have me and then perhaps others spread the story through their syndicated news service, spread the word that uh things were not going to be good for American athletes of Jewish background. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Um the, the possibility of manufacturing such events when they really didn’t exist, was presented by one person from an American news syndicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was a kind of situation where um my, my greatest hope would have been the ability to just knock them out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> uh and get them off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He followed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> out into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and then met the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> 80 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> checking on where could he get where could he dig a good story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  But there was no foundation for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  But there was no foundation for that, that’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Speaking of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ride over, what was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">was it exciting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  It was very exciting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Say the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ride over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Yes, the, the boat ride over was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">People were thinking about um Eleanor Holmes Jarrett, wondering about the allegations that she was drinking, using alcohol, using tobacco, there were statements having to do with I think a reduction in the credibility of some of the American athletes was rampant. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And uh it got cleared up I think after the thing was laid out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and was forcefully presented. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">QW: What was special about this boat ride over? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">What was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  What was happening was the athletes were not sitting around, they were in training. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I was surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Jesse Owens, Marty Glickman uh Marty Stoller a whole bunch of athletes, running, jumping. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">14 15
QUESTION:  I need you to say that over because you said Marty Stoller instead of Sam Stoller. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So what was going on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Uh there was a great deal of activity going on, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They were practicing in their events. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They were movement, there was, there was nobody sitting around reading a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Uh they were trying hard to keep their weight down. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They worked very hard in every aspect of uh self care. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And it was important because these athletes needed to have that great uh spirit, the great ability, the great uh uh bodily condition in which to participate and I think the Americans had it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Was this an exciting opportunity for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  It was an exciting opportunity for me for the first reason, Mickey Cochrane was aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and one wondered why would the manager of the Detroit Tigers be on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Well uh all the um anxiety about it ended for me when I got word that I was picked up by the Detroit Tigers to become a member of the Detroit Tigers as, baseball team and to become a member of that a rookie staff and then to play with that team. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And to play with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> in the <span class="REGION">International League</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Uh they were all very excited to have major league managers talk to you and who knows how much they were watching and what notes they were taking, who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But at any rate it was a great feeling that um having important people on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was present and they were taking um plenty of time to talk to athletes and to be with them and to try to assess what they were really like and uh I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I happened to hook on well with the Detroit Tigers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  The games themselves, what was it like being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  It was thrilling in so many ways because you looked out on the <span class="DLF">playing field</span> and you saw <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for 125,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Not every event drew 125,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Some drew fewer numbers than that but however it was a very exciting thing to see that size crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Also to see a group playing a game that they weren’t used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">The <span class="DLF">foul lines</span> were white ribbons four inches wide and they didn’t put plaster of paris or yellow uh white dirt down on the <span class="DLF">field</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  ...move on...the atmosphere, the general ambience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> where I sat next to Marty Glickman for several weeks while events were going on there were some things happening that uh gave you some more idea of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Hitler did not stay in the visible area of his <span class="INT_SPACE">private balcony</span> when a German athlete won an event. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">When a German athlete won an event he walked out on his little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">He raised his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">There as a lot of applause and then uh he went back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">When a black athlete perhaps Jewish athletes too, there were very few of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I couldn’t count, there wasn’t time to count uh the Jewish athletes and the black athletes especially caused Hitler to turn around and to walk out of his own <span class="INT_SPACE">private balcony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">In other words he did not 15 16 want to be seen praising a black athlete even in his own track and field area. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He just didn’t want to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  So what you’re saying 1s, explain this to me once more. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You could see Hitler from where you were sitting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  From where I could see Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I could see Hitler every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I could see him every day because his travels were mainly going from inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Some applause for the German athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">His hand down when a black athlete won an event and his reverse and his walking out of his <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> when some the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> became the winner of an event. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He did not demonstrate the uh real feelings of uh Olympic history, Olympic meaning, Olympic strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He did not demonstrate that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was only what he could gain out of his own team’s participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  And so he didn’t even salute other white athletes basically just his own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  He did not salute white athletes, he stayed away from any opportunity to applaud an athlete who won an event who came from a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that he didn’t like perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I can’t describe it another way but it, I would say it would be accurate to say that uh he removed himself from his own <span class="INT_SPACE">private balcony</span> as often as he wanted to, to demonstrate his own feeling and uh that’s what I saw all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Marty and I were very close to the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> where, Hitler’s <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> were not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We could see that happening, his walking back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  What was it like seeing Hitler up close like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Uh I was no more than five feet away from him in the swimming meets. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I went to the swimming meets and I learned that Hitler went to many of the events without prior notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">For example wrestling. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Uh the kinds of events that didn’t draw big crowds and without prior notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">In other words he didn’t tell all on the phone the committee connected with a particular event. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He would just arrive there I his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , get out, follow his entourage, get up in the <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> , sit there for 3, 4, 5 minutes, get out, go to the next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">That we saw very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Um there was nothing that I can report that indicates that some one in charge of an athletic event of such great importance would behave that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I could, I could sense it yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Was there something frightening about him? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Something awesome about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Yes because.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  I need you to say the whole thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Yes, I, I think there was some frightening um characteristics of that type of behavior because it was evident that he did not wish to demonstrate fairness to uh 16 17 athletes from several different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Uh he avoided the opportunity to be even handed as often as possible which is one of the, one of the credos of the Olympiad to, to be fair to all the countries of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  Was there anything just viscerally significant about his presence? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">As: — Uh, walking out onto the <span class="DLF">field</span> , he did that at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Please say that again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  When Hitler was walking out onto the <span class="DLF">field</span> and that happened several times, it was very, very difficult to understand uh how he could possibly behave one way in the stands, another on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , another way to the press. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Another way to perhaps his own political leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was very difficult to understand that because um the uh work of the Olympiad is entirely different than, than being angry at other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It’s being friendly, it’s being togetherness, trying to work together, trying to understand each other from different parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  Did he have a commanding presence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  What is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Did he have, did Hitler have a commanding presence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Hitler had a very commanding presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Never strong enough to present it solo but always second or <span class="DLF">third line</span> with other protective units around him all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Never, never walking into a situation by himself but at least Goebbels and many of the others, 10, 12 people surrounding, walking uh in a way that would, would give you a fright.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  And the audience went wild for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  When he entered the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , when Hitler entered the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> there was great applause. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">There was tremendous attempt for his own citizens, his, his German participants, his German spectators to applaud uh the, his, his presence yes that’s true and they felt that he was the producer of this grand spectacle, this grand spectacle to make it possible for the rest of the world to be waiting and watching uh what was going on in Hitler, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you a question again about your role over there because I know that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> you played exhibition games and after that you did what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  After we played an exhibition game, we would assign a series of locations where the 28 of us on the Olympic baseball team were divided into squads and working with local uh physical education teachers and leaders uh to teach baseball to <span class="BUILDING">clubs</span> , to teams, to, not to fight them against their great desire to play soccer but to 17 18 teach them that there was another sport and that the rest of the world was waiting for them to come into baseball.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Did you play exhibition games in these <span class="NPIP">locations</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  We played exhibition games throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Did you ever experience any anti Jewish sentiment while you were doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  None whatsoever on my, my part, none on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">The only anti-Semitic feeling that I had slight touch for had to do with the um the newspaper syndicated people who wanted to meet a manufacturer’s story.</span></p>
