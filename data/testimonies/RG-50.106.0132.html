ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I think both my mother’s and my father’s family, I can trace them back to the grandparents and maybe even the great grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I’m not sure about the great grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Do you know where those previous generations then came from?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  My father had a business education. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I think it -- it could be -- it -- 1t wouldn’t be a university degree, but it was probably equated to a business background and business kind of schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">July 29, 2000
QUESTION:  Did you have many extended family in the <span class="REGION">area</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Aunts, uncles, cousins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother had two sisters and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">One of the sisters at the time lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and the other sister did live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">In fact, we were very close with that sister -- with that sister’s children. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">She had two daughters and my two cousins were -- one was three years older than my sister and the other one was another three years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And one of the sisters always -- the younger one, Susie, who now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , went every year with us to a vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  So you had close relationships with your cousins.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Yes, with that -- with only that cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My mother’s brother had no children, my mother’s other sister had no children, so these were our only cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">From what I recollect, I had two grandmothers, both grandfathers had been dead, and I think one of them died when I was probably about four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My other grandmother, which was my maternal grandmother was very -- she was with us a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She went away with us every single summer, and I saw quite a bit of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Tell me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that you lived in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I lived in a -- 1t was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fourth district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We -- we had -- we rented -- I don’t think we owned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It -- it went the whole length of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I was lucky enough to get a picture of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I forgot to bring it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And --
QUESTION:  Remember what <span class="DLF">street</span> it was on? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">July 29, 2000
ANSWER:  Yes, the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was Winnersal strasse. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I forgot the number now, but I was able to relocate the number through some of the documents that I found in my mother’s portfolio, where my mu -- where my mother kept all her documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It -- it looked out on a little <span class="DLF">plaza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I -- I tried to find it and I- actually I couldn’t recognize the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because the bottom of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had been changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It -- it became more commercial now, they have like <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> ’ <span class="DLF">windows</span> on the bottom, but the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> seems to be the same that we lived on. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And we probably had approximately, I don’t know, about 15 - 20 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was a very extens -- because our -- some of our staff lived with us and the rest of the staff used to come in, like the laundress and the seamstress and the tutors, they just came in and left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And what other kind of staff did your parents have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Okay, we had a cook and we had a maid and we had a governess and they lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The chauffeur did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  So you also had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Yes, we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Sounds like it was an upper class family that you were born into.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  I guess so. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I would say so, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Actually, the real upper class was my -- my grandmother’s brother, who had -- who was the president of the southern railroad at the time, and he was really what we call, almost like an aristocrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He had an July 29, 2000 incredible <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that he used to have guided tours in because it was full of beautiful, very precious paintings and furniture and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  His name was Gustav Fall, and he had a monument erected in his honor in front of a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that the railroad owned, which was on the bu -- mountain outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , it was called Zemmering. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I don’t think the monument exists any more, I know the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> does not and I know that they have some kind of vaca -- rec -- recreational facilities there now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  How religious was your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Not very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We did -- we -- we -- we were part of the Jewish community and we did go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , but only on high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">On the other hand, we did have a Christmas tree, supposedly for the staff, to honor them. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I tried to find the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but the only <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> that we located was one that was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And later on when I talked to one of my distant relatives, I was told that there were several <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> and that probably was not the one that I attended as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Did you celebrate any Jewish holidays at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No, we did not have Friday night candle lights or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The only -- we did in a sense, Yom Kippur, because he -- my father always fasted on Yom July 29, 2000 Kippur, this was one thing that he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And so did my mother and I guess so did we as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Later on, of course, that was no longer done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Did they come from religious families, your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  I don’t think so -- I think the Austrian -- I -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I -- I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I don’t remember my grandmother being -- bringing up religion in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We did have religious training though, but the religious training came because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at the time religion was part of the curriculum, and since we were Jewish, that was not given in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So I remember we had a Hebrew teacher coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , teaching us Hebrew and religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Did you exchange Christmas presents among yourselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I think the presents were mostly for the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But I also don’t remember any Hanukah big gifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Frankly, I don’t remember presents as such as part of a traditional festivity. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I know I got my first gold ring because I ate some meat, which I refused to eat previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I remember that whenever my parents went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , because my mother bought most of her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> there, they would bring us back -- and clothes were always uppermind -- in my mind, even as a little girl, and I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But I -- I -- I don’t remember any presents as such that were particularly meaningful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I remember as a little girl I had little dolls that I liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I think when Hitler came I could take a few with me, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But somehow they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But I don’t remember like having had a specific toy that July 29, 2000 I was attached to, like my little granddaughter now 1s with -- with Minnie Mouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I - | don’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Maybe I blacked it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I -- I can’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Did you have a Passover Seder?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And if we did, I don’t remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about your schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Okay, we went -- we did not attend <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , we attended the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and I remember the greatest embarrassment was that we were brought there with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the chauffeur and I was very embarrassed about not being able to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I was never allowed to even cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> by myself or walk any <span class="NPIP">place</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My biggest pleasure was that my mother once took me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That was a big excitement for me because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> I -- I kind of disliked riding in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , because I used to get carsick a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Would you say that your parents were overly protective, or was this the usual way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  That -- that was the usual way that the governesses and in the circle of friends that we grew up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But y -- then most of the -- I -- I can’t remember why we did not go to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , but most of the children of my fr -- of my father’s and mother’s friends did attend <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We did go to a <span class="BUILDING">private dancing school</span> , and we did have piano lessons in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a piano teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But I -- and I also remember coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we had the governesses that were supposed to instruct us in July 29, 2000 French and English, but we also had some kind of a tutor come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But nothing much came of tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  What kind of relationship did you have with your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  My sister was very domineering, very bossy, and my father clearly always favored my sister, which was a big problem for me as a child because I felt he was very unjust. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> the oldest child had a lot of privileges that the younger child didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So I was very annoyed at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She was allowed to go at night to the opera, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She was allowed to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> later, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">She was allowed a lot of fe -- also, I had a lot of hand-me-down dresses from her, which I terribly resented. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I always wanted to have the same clothes as she did, I was dreaming of her being left back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so we could be in the same grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What -- how would you describe yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">What kind of a child were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Were you quiet, or more outgoing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  I was a very, very noisy child. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The way we were brought up, we were not allowed to speak at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I was not allowed to come to the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> ovi -- until I knew how to cut my own meat, or -- an-and use the fork properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I -- my father even got a record once because we were not allowed to talk unless talked to, and he once made a record on the phonograph saying, Dorrit eat, Dorrit eat, Dorrit don’t talk, Dorrit don’t talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that’s how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I had endless hours as a child that I remember of eating in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">| hated to eat and I would push the food July 29, 2000 from one cheek to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I had an uncle who always touched me at the cheek and said for me to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I would forever sit and eat, from morning to night, because I was underweight, I had asthma -- I was an asthmatic child, and the governesses were told that we had to eat, that I particularly had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So they kept me at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> s -- what seems to me still hours and hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Like breakfast went into the snack, the snack went into the -- the midday meal, and the midday meal went into the afternoon meal and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  What -- be-because of your asthma were you on medication or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Yes, I was on medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I had what they call an inhaler and I wasn’t allowed to run, and I wasn’t allowed to exercise too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">As a privilege therefore, in the summers my mother just took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> , the spas and I had all kinds of -- of these <span class="INT_SPACE">mineral water baths</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">mud baths</span> that were supposed to help me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Who were your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Did you have friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  No, there was no such things as friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We had friends that were my mother’s and father’s friends who had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We had -- the only set of friends that I remember were two boys, and I absolutely detested the younger one, because he was my age, and adored the older one, who was supposedly my sister’s friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But the only friends we really had was my sister had my cousin as a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But I was always relegated to my grandmother and to the governess and I don’t remember any play dates or playing with any friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">July 29, 2000
QUESTION:  Did you know you were Jewish, and if so, what did that mean to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  I definitely knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It meant to me that I went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , 1t meant to me that I had to have the private instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It meant to be -- to be excluded while the -- while the other children in the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> had their Catholic instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It didn’t mean a great deal, I think, as far as tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And as a child, until the Hitler came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I was totally unaware of the antis -- anti- Semitism that must have existed at that time already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  What did you do in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when the other children went to their Christian education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I don’t remember what they made us do. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">All I know is that we did not participate, and therefore we had to study Hebrew at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Did you sense anything among the teachers or the other students about your being different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  No, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I -- I remember -- a-as I said, I was not -- I was a very vivacious child, I was a very talkative child, and I remember being reprimanded for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I remember that I -- I had friends in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I don’t remember them as such, but I remember sitting with them and wanting to be with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Were your parents Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  No, neither my father nor my s -- my -- my mother were Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The closest I came to the Zionist exposure was that I knew that my older cousin, not my younger July 29, 2000 cousin, started being in that group just before we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I’m not totally sure that I knew of it while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , or whether it was told to me later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Were your parents a-active politically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  No, no, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Not that I know of, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Had you heard ab -- preceding 1938, had you heard of a man named Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Before that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I must have, but I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I know we -- in the group of friends that my father had, we identified ourselves as Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My father was very proud to have fought in the first World War as an Austrian -- I think he was a captain or a lieutenant or something like that, and he had many decorations. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And he was very proud of being Austrian, much more so, I think, than being Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  And that infiltrated to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You felt more Austrian than Jewish, a-as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  I think as a young child I didn’t feel either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I really didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I was much more preoccupied of what was happening at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my sister, with my cousin, with -- with the governesses, who really f -- always favored my sister because she was quiet and I was very noisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I still remember my father saying, we can only hear one child in this whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that’s me. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I -- I remember I was very grega -- gregarious. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I know we were re -- presented when -- whenever my father and my July 29, 2000 mother had big social affairs in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the evening, we were all dressed up and presented, and I loved that, because everybody made a fuss over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And then of course, my sister hated to go and she was forced to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I also remember that my sister was allowed to have long curls and I was not because my mother felt all the attention went to me and not to my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I’m -- since my father favored so much my sister, my mother favored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But truthfully, while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we were very little involved with either parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We were strictly with the governess and there were maybe not -- just maybe at the mealtime, the main mealtime at noon, that we sometimes ate with them, not always. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And on Saturday and Sunday, I remember a little bit of my father playing with us, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">A very little, very little interplay. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And then the summer we hardly ever saw them because they went on trips from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we always went to for the summer, which was a small <span class="REGION">estate</span> where we rented a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Where was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  That was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was in Unter achem artazay. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And it was a beautiful, what I recollect as big <span class="REGION">estate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">My sister later -- later told me it was a small one. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And we had a <span class="BUILDING">boat house</span> and my father had a cousin that owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> further down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , whom we saw also, socially. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But my parents were there not July 29, 2000 that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They usually took off on their own vacation, and we were left with my grandmother, my cousin and the governess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Did you have any favorite songs as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  As a young child, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I don’t -- oh yes, I -- I remember my uncle singing to me, but it wasn't necessarily my favorite song. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He used to sing to us one of- of the -- of the Schiller poems, the -- it’s called the earl -- the Earl Kernik, it’s -- it’s about a man that rides on a horse with a small child who’s -- who 1s dying, but he always changed the ending and we always knew this wasn’t the ending, because the ending goes that he has his son, he holds his son, who 1s dead in his arms, and my uncle used to sing and they ate together a bread of -- of butter and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I hated that, because I knew it was fake.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  What language did you di -- speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  We spoke exclusively German, and the only other language my -- the governesses were supposed to teach us French and English and we knew -- we learned absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I don’t remember anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Oh, in English I knew there was a little girl that had curl right in her fi -- forehead, and if she was bad, she was very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">July 29, 2000
QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Now, you said you don’t know if you remembered hearing about a man named Hitler before he came into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Let’s move up to that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">What is the first memory you have of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  My first recollection is of terror, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We all went with that family that -- where I hated the two boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We went in a -- on an afternoon -- actually no, the very first recollection is a radio when Hitler first entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and the -- the reception that he got and the -- the ovation that he got entering <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  Did your family go to see him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Did you know anybody who went to see him come in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The second recollection was that we went to the pratta, which is the big <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> and it’s also a <span class="DLF">park</span> where you can walk, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And it was that the f -- the four of us, our family and the other family, we were just walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And then we were suddenly brought into a -- into a <span class="DLF">line</span> , we were lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I don’t remember how they identified us as Jews, we -- it could be that we already wore the yellow sign naming us as Jews, but I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But somehow we were put in that <span class="DLF">line</span> , and my father somehow had his decorations from first world -- from the first world one with him, and I don’t know by what miracle he convinced one of the men to let us go, our family and the other family. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And we then heard that that -- that July 29, 2000 that whole procession had to go to a <span class="DLF">monument</span> and clean the monument on their knees and then they were just deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So it was a very frightening experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  How did your parents explain it to you, you were eight years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  I don’t think they explained anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They explain -- my father then disappeared, he went we -- he -- he had to leave immediately, it’s actually the chauffeur that was hiding him because they were looking for him, since he was a -- an important figure in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And then my next recollection is that we were packing and we had these big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span> and my sister and I were playing hide and seek, and my uncle drew me out, stood me up and he said, you children, can’t you help your mother, instead you’re playing these stupid games, and she’s -- there’s a lot of trouble, and you really have to behave now. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So that’s what I remember, and the excitement of leaving, yet I was totally aware that when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , which was maybe a month or two later, we got an exit visa to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> --
QUESTION:  This was a month or two after Hitler came in?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  No, must be blocked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I remember it -- again having to wear it, I think, in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> when Hitler came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So I think we had to wear it twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I remember then being shocked that I saw it on baby carriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I don’t remember any reaction, we just wore it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Did you talk things over with your sister -- no, I’m talking about early on, when you’re still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and Hitler had come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I remember as a chil -- the only real recollection I had was that I really didn’t want to be different, that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I was -- I was very unhappy having to be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was very unhappy to leave my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I remember leaving the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I went out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and I told myself, remember exactly what this <span class="NPIP">place</span> looks like because you may not remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And for years afterwards I would recall that picture in my mind, that’s why I was so sure I would recollect my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And I would recollect the exact position my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was in -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that my sister and I shared, and that was somehow comforting to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Were there any other changes in your life while you were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , after Hitler came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">July 29, 2000

<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  I ge -- probably I was pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Hitler’s a big holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And then when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> we didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We again had some French lessons, but it -- it was just a total holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And we loved <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because that was the first time my mother was in charge of us and we drove her nuts, my sister and I.
QUESTION:  Were there any other restrictions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> besides no schooling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  I’m sure there were and I’m sure that we were very careful where we went and what we -- what <span class="DLF">streets</span> we went to or if we went out at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Were you upset when your father left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  No, didn’t bother me at all because he was very often gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We were really not taken care of by either my father, nor my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They were like visitors, I would say.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  I guess my father couldn’t get a visa for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And I -- I know later on, when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and my father had an opportunity to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my mother refused, because she said she wouldn’t leave Europe, because of her mother was still in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And I do remember that I always wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as a kind of savior. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So I -- I was very much aware of the danger.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">ANSWER:  We just went off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I think the -- the -- just the idea that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was fabulous, but I don’t remember, you know, I’m touching <span class="REGION">American soil</span> as being something significant to me at the time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">QUESTION:  And then you se -- yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1056">ANSWER:  But mostly we just ran from one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to the other if we wanted to see somebody that we wanted to see, and then we all always met in that common <span class="BUILDING">recreational hall</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  What was your impression of the American teenagers in your class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">ANSWER:  We had almost nothing to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We despised the girls because our boys later on fabricated all kinds of -- of stories about what the American girls would do that we didn’t do, and we -- we were totally not knowledgeable about lipstick and -- and nail polish or any of the -- or any kind of cosmetics at all, or any kind of grooming, so we thought they were overdone and overdressed and over-silly, and we had absolutely no contact whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">We really disliked them intensely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">QUESTION:  And the teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">ANSWER:  I personally had no -- no recollection or no impression of any teacher that was especially nice to me or especially interested in me, so -- but there were very variant experiences throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because many of the people in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> adored their teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I know my friend Paul loved his -- his shop teacher and he -- he used to make me all kinds of wooden animals after -- because of the shop teachers, and he- he loved that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And I know that my -- Elfie’s sister, who went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> -- in fact, we saw a letter that she wrote to her and she loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">So it -- it was variant experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But I think mainly I was so embittered of having to sit in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , that was so much below my dignity that I really didn’t take to anybody there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">QUESTION:  Did you notice a change in the appearance of the other people that came with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">In other words you all were -- had been under such difficult conditions before you July 29, 2000 got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and I think you had said that you didn’t realize it, it was because you yourself were not in good condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Did you notice a -- a gradual physical improvement in the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">QUESTION:  Absolutely yes, because I was always very conscious of clothes and appearances and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">The first thing I knew is that my friend Jeanette got a whole wardrobe shipped to her by some relatives or some distant friends or something that was absolutely, to me the most beautiful, most fabulous clothes ever, and I was jealous as ca -- not really jealous, I just was very much taken by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">But we also had, I think, we got some money from some -- from my -- and my cou -- my distant cousin that then picked us up when we were released, and then we also had some visitors and I think some -- somehow my father got money, so when it was permissible, I remember going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> and my mother and -- with my mother and sister and we bought dresses and we bought clothes and we bought some stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I mean, as far as I’m concerned now, they -- I’m sure <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> was not a high fashion place for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">But to -- at me -- to me at that time, I’m sure it was fine, because as I see from the pictures now, we had nice shorts, we had nice blouses and stuff and we certainly didn’t look like bad -- like -- like we u -- disheveled like when we arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">QUESTION:  Were there many visitors? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I know Eleanor Roosevelt came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Did you see her?</span></p>

QUESTION:  So you became a member of this group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">ANSWER:  Oh definitely I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Not my sister, she didn't want to have anything to do with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">QUESTION:  And what did the Zionist group do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">ANSWER:  Oh we -- we danced, we -- we learned all the dances, which I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">We sang songs, we -- I guess what a youth group like that does, I --
QUESTION:  So this woman came and stayed with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  Yes, she stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for many, many months and she -- she -- she did all these things with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">QUESTION:  Why do you think your sister was not interested?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">ANSWER:  Oh, because she refused being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">She refused being a Jew later on in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">She only accepted that she was Catholic, and she pretended to be the ca -- a Catholic the rest of her life and died as a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  Was that because you had been in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I think it had to do with her other lessons, that she was older when all this happened to her and I think she turned the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Just as like my cousin, who was two years older than she was turned an extreme Zionist, went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and July 29, 2000 lived in the -- in -- on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and raised her children there and became an adamant supporter of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">My sister just went the other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Because these things happened to her because she was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">But she -- she -- she spend the rest of her life hiding the fact that she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And she and I had numerous fights about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  And he was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  Well, he also had converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">He never recognized the Jewish faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">QUESTION:  So they both officially converted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">ANSWER:  Well, no, because they both had ba -- they -- see, so many of us Jews converted in Europe, as a matter of total -- of -- of -- of paperwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Some people recognized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">The majority, I would say, in -- 99 percent threw it in the garbage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">QUESTION:  But your sister and brother-in-law just continued to live that way?</span></p>
