<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family -- your family and your life before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in 1894 and he left <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in 1910. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And on his way to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And after World War I -- he was in the French Foreign Legion during World War I -- he went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , married my mother, took her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And so I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , my sister was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And before the war, life was -- the life of Jewish immigrants in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- tolerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I wouldn't say affluent, but well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Until the recession. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And we didn't have major problems in terms of intolerance and suspicion of being a foreigner until really the mid -- late 30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Very, very shortly before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Very shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And that came about, of course, with in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And a -- the beginning of, or maybe the renewal of French Nationalism, which was very strong during the Dreyfus (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="13">business. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Of course, I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father was not there either, but we knew a lot of people who lived through those times, and I believe that was the seed of what we felt after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">That Dreyfus business was -- is still very important in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but in the 30's, Dreyfus was still alive, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The controversy around his name was really the trigger for the French Nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Did you live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , or were you necessarily integrated into the general --
ANSWER:  No, we never -- we never lived in a -- well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was essentially the , that's -- that is on the right bank of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel</span> there, that's where you find all the kosher butchers, and where you buy your matzo for Pesach and where they have the traditional <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But other than that <span class="REGION">area</span> , the Jews were kind of scattered until the 30's or so, when they started to get togetherin__—_—sand the Follies Bergere, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But, no, we were scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We were scattered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Just like so many Jewish families before the war, religion was not -- all our friends -- religion was not an important -- well, we -- young people would be -- yes -- respect it, but we would get gifts at Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And we had bread for Pesach. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had matzo and bread at the same time on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We ate pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">SO we were very . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And all our friends were the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But we -- culturally, we were very, very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">There were still many Jewish activities going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and very strong <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And we grew up with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There were five or six stages where you could go and have a nice afternoon or evening with <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There were friends of mine who were Scouts and the Scout movement -- the Jewish Scout movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There were Zionist groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There were Socialist groups, part of more or less the Bund. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And so religion was not very important and that always was a point of friction when my grandfather visited from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was always a point of friction with my family, because he wanted a kosher plate and couldn't find it, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the French Catholics? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Did you mix socially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Oh, I -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- my first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- my -- my -- was <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That was with the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And what, about three, three and a half, or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And my sister was born and was really a nuisance so I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And was very good because I needed the . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then after that I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We had no discrimination -- was not beaten by the other kids because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They never -- never said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">No, we were normal kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Did you play with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And they played with me and -- sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  What was -- um -- what was your father's business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  He had a business of interior decoration. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Painting, wallpaper and -- but on a large scale in the 30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He would re-do movie theaters, and small <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and stuff like that with deadlines so he had to work at night with a large group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And they were Russian -- Russian immigrants, those people, who were all first cousin of the Czar, of course, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So it was colorful, 1t was colorful. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">That was, you know, until -- untilthe ——_—saof '35- '36. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That was the turning point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Can we just ask you another question? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You had mentioned Jewish cultural and political activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Where you or your family involved in them? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Were you Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We -- we -- just like all the Jewish family we had the blue piggy bank of the where we would put money in it and somebody from the would come once a month and collect that and that would support -- that would support <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we were getting a Jewish paper, . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But that -- that was the extent of it -- was the extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Just -- just having family members and friends with the same background that was our -- that was the extent of our Jewishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  You had mentioned, also, Russian immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Was there a difference in the way French -- traditionally French Jews -- versus immigrants from other -- from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> were treated in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Oh, those Russians immigrants were -- were -- none of them are Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Oh, they were not -- oh, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I believe maybe one was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But all the rest of them were -- were -- I don't know if they were -- they were -- the White Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They were counts, and were really a funny bunch of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But they were good workers so my father hired them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  So in the 30's when Hitler came to power, how aware were you of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Were there refugees coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  The refugees started to come in '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Most of the refugees that we saw were from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I remember one of them -- whose name was Godel also -- and he came to see us and my father helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And we got in touch with him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He was able to come here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And we lost track of him -- but -- and so they told us what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I don't remember being in contact with German Jews, but Austrian Jews, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  What was -- what was your reaction to this? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">This information you were getting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Uh, well, we -- I know my parents were very, very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Very, very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And we were looking at Hitler as -- as a danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But at the same time, being in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you know, the traditional enemy of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the strong French Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We felt very secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Well, if they move, we're going to leave them and Hitler is going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , or wherever he came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That was the feeling in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Very few people were aware of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  So you weren't particularly threatened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  We -- we -- we were not -- no -- not by the French, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  But by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Germany</span> was -- was a danger for -- for the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">People were talking about re-armament of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so forth, but at the same time, we -- we -- as I say, you know, we were feeling that we had the <span class="DLF">Maginot line</span> protecting us, that the French Army was so strong, that we had the best weapons, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And all that propaganda of the French government, trying to -- not trying -- but -- I believe they believed that, themselves, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They believed that, yes, the <span class="DLF">Maginot line</span> was very strong, that the French engineers were building the best <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and building the best <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , and the French Army was invincible. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The navy was the second in the world, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So -- and -- yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  When did you learn differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  At the defeat of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Well, when the French Army collapsed and all of a sudden German soldiers were invading <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , that's -- that's when we felt the impact of defeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And the danger of an enemy of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the Jews at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So -- so we were threatened on two aspects. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So it was really a feeling of total despair and fear all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">All of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">A different reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And we had to adjust to that different reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Do you remember when the Germans occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Well, we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> the 10th of June in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We were among the last to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Everybody was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And -- well, we were just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we spent the first two years of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And the --
QUESTION:  Can you describe to me the German occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The initial -- the first days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  I was not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">No, I can describe the German occupation of <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> -- the first days. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Where- it was about the 15th or 16th of June and we had reached that small <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Peaceful, beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">medieval town</span> with old, walled medieval town and it was beautiful, beautiful summer -- oh, spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And it was the first time that we really were out so -- that far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in a couple of years or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And it was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Beautiful landscape and the smell of <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And so we used to walk in the evening around that -- that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  What's the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And in the distance we could see -- on the <span class="DLF">road</span> in the distance -- moving side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We could see that in the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And we had seen very few French soldiers in the preceding days. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There were very few French soldiers in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , practically none. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Were just a few stragglers who were trying to go wherever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And so we saw -- late at night -- 1t was almost dusk -- and the color of their uniform was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So at first we thought they were British soldiers who were trying to -- to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> to -- we were told that the British were re-embarking that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">No, they were Germans, and it was absolutely frightening, because they were -- I'm sure they were exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And they were two to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">One was driving and the other one was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sidecar</span> with a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And their face was -- they were blonde and -- they were -- they had the typical Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And their face covered with the dust of the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- they were looking absolutely -- they were awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They were raw, military power. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And of course, I understood that years later, when I was myself in the Army, the people who are sent like that are the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They are the people who can analyze a situation and take action and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So they passed by us, and I remember we were walking by the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the French Gendarmes and it was a hot evening and they had like a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there with the sign and the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And the wife of one of the Gendarmes there almost collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">She had a -- she had a cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And they removed the French flag immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They knew what -- so -- and they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And then the next morning, the other came, and they were the Herman Goerring (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="177">division. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And they came with big guns and weapons and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And they stopped to engage in conversation with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And -- I'm sure they were under orders to be very friendly -- and they were friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They were friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">One of them asked me why I was not in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And I told him, "Well, I'm 15." </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He said, "Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , 15, . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And they were very proud to be member of the Herman Goerring division. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And they were telling us, Well, a week we'll be in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And after that they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I don't know where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And they were replaced by the regular German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">That <span class="NPIP">place</span> was like an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">administrative city</span> , so they established a commandanture there. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But that was essentially for them -- you know, they -- they ordered a curfew for the population and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But at the same time they were trying to show to the French people that, Well, we are not that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I remember, we stayed there one month before we were able to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And one of the son of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was a Navy officer who died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And his body was recovered and was sent to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be buried in the <span class="BUILDING">family vault</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> came to the funeral in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And the Germans sent an honor guard there. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And they allowed his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> to be draped in the French flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So -- and when -- when -- so they had a Mass inside the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and when they came out, you know, people were carrying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> on their shoulders, and the Germans had the salute with their rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Now, I may have interrupted you earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">When you were -- when you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to go to <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> --

<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  When you were living that month up in <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> and the Germans were there, did they distinguish between Jews and non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The Germans couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">At the time -- they were in the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And they -- they interfered very little with the French administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">The armistice had been signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The Vichy government was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The Germans were controlling, essentially -- railroad system was controlled by them, maybe the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , in terms of supervision. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But they had absolutely no interference with the French, absolutely none whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Actually, they were trying to be friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They didn't ask anybody "Are you Jewish or not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="264">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Absolutely not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  So you decided to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Well, we had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We couldn't stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The -- that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was very, very -- that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was very, very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We -- our money was running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">My father couldn't work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So since we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> anyway, we had to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So -- and the German also wanted the people who were refugees to go back to where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And so I believe that they had like a census, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I know we needed a special form to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And that was the German who gave that. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And maybe they asked if -- I don't recall exactly, but they might have a box on that form, or one way to ask 1f you were Jewish or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But anyway, to get on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you needed a pass from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And we got there, we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And that's when the impact also -- we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> a month earlier was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> -- you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> and no German. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And all of a sudden, there were very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> -- now <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> were just for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">There were very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> which were reserved simply for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And Germans everywhere, in all kinds of uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">All kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And they had taken the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> and that was a -- and this and that, and <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And they had posters with propaganda and warnings. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was a sad picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">A very sad picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And so many -- so many business were -- were still closed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">People had not returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So we arrived there and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Metro</span> was working -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Metro</span> was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Metro</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Went to the other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">That was July, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And life was -- life was as usual, at least temporarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Until -- I'm trying to remember if it was September of that year that -- that was the German who asked -- the census of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But the census was done by the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And my father had to go to . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">was the administrative center -- it was the of that department where we were, which was at the time called and now it's -- I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was changed since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So he went there and he had to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And he registered the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And that was the beginning of that of that spiral of discrimination and persecution and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So -- so shortly after that, he had to fill out forms about our belongings, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , our jewelry, our books of art, et cetera, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And then we couldn't have a telephone, we couldn't have a radio set. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And so that was in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And then he had restrictions about what he could do, in terms of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">He couldn't do this, he couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But he was still working. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my sister was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And for ordinary life -- life was absolutely normal for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We had -- we had very- except for those restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And we couldn't travel too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But -- but other than that, we could go to the movies, we could go to -- our food -- you know, the coupons for food were the same as the general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We had absolutely no discrimination at that time, either from the Germans or the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Absolutely none. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Then in 1942, that's when things started to change drastically.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  Oh, that was at the beginning of the war, in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We were afraid of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> being bombarded, so- and the French government asked people who had family in the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> or a secondary home outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to leave -- most of the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They asked most of the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , but essentially <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They did the same in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , by the way, at the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they sent the children all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and some of them were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> also -- to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- English children -- and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So -- so we had that second <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">At first my father was still keeping his business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And the business was not good anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So -- and he was known locally, so he found a -- he found enough to do locally.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">No, not the forged one. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">My parents had the forged one. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I had my regular one. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And a year earlier it was stamped "Jew" with a big red stamp. . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And a friend of mine told me that if you dip a wooden match with a cotton tip -- like a Q-tip -- if you dip that in bleach and you go very carefully over the red, it disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So I took a chance and I went very carefully over -- did that -- took one of those long, wooden matches that we still had in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at the time, with the cotton, bleach, and it disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So the only -- the only way they could have found that I was Jewish was if I would be arrested in circumstances where they would check on my identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But mine was a legitimate one. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">You could see that it was not forged. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And I was taking a chance because had they checked on me, asked that <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span> there in "What about him?" </span><span class="sentence" id="624">and they would have looked in their and said "Oh, . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But I took a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I wanted to survive at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And so -- so we -- we crossed that -- that <span class="DLF">line</span> of demarcation. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It was very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Very, very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">It was -- was very scary, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would stop in the middle of the night and you had to have the curtains down and sit in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and you were not allowed to look <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And we could hear, you know, the Germans walking up and down like a wooden with their heavy boots in the middle of the night there. . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And from both ends of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> they had German soldiers with -- officer and so forth -- checking those there. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And they were talking loudly among themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And was very organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And the German Army is very militaristic and traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And I found out that in their rules and regulation when you have a check-point, you have to ask, I believe, a major and another officer and an NCO and then you have to have a private holding a -- one of those lamps -- oil lamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So they were -- I can see -- still see that tall German officer who was, I believe, a major or something, who must have been a hero of World War I. He must have been in his 50's and talking to the other one, and the NCO and they were looking at the and they were looking at the identity card, and they wanted to find out what was in my mother's suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So she opened that and the oil was all over the sugar and everything, so they laughed and they said "Well." </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And then they have that little guy with the lantern following and he was just as frightened as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And so just before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left, I was too curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I had to peep out. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And I saw that and it was really frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We were -- we were on a -- like a -- a <span class="DLF">platform</span> with barbed wire, big floodlights and those Germans going up and down with their rifle on their shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Oh, it was -- so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left, and by then we -- we were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and the man who was with us came back to collect those -- ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And he told my -- he told us Okay, be very careful when you get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> because there are very important events which are taking place in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And the same night that we got there, Eisenhower landed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Was during the night Saturday to Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the 11th of November, and they were planning to do that, from what I understand, a long time before they did, but three days later the Germans were back. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We saw the German back. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So -- but at least this time, nobody knew where we were, nobody knew who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So we got to that niece of our neighbor who didn't know who we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">This is -- this is -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  Before you made this decision, you were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> four or five months, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  From November the 7 or 8th. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And that was April -- the first week of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  So what was the daily life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">How threatened were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Were you just living normally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Well -- okay -- so the Germans came and they were not in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But then around January or February -- I don't remember exactly -- they had like a red zone going all along the French-Spanish border -- all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And that was extremely, extremely reinforced in terms of patrol, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And that -- that small <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with maybe two or three hundred people, that's all, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So -- so it had two or three <span class="DLF">streets</span> at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So one <span class="DLF">street</span> was the main <span class="DLF">road</span> , so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It's a narrow <span class="DLF">road</span> going from one small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It was the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And the other one was like a very narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> -- I don't even know if it was paved or not- leading to -- not even -- they didn't even have any <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Just <span class="DLF">farms</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And they had like a <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> which was just across the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was close by the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I should have taken a picture of that with me, but it doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So -- and right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they had that <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And they were selling, you know, the tobacco, and it was like a -- the baker would come and leave bread there and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And they would sell liquor, and wine, and it was like a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so -- when the Germans draw that <span class="DLF">line</span> and they had patrol post every mile or so, that was the headquarter there. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And the people who were the owner of that -- of that <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> , their son was in the Waffen SS -- French. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And they were suspicious that something was not right with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But they knew the husband of that lady extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He was a respected World War I veteran, he was the chief of the veteran organization, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And -- so -- so they didn't want to -- to really -- at the time, annoy that lady, but I'm sure with time they would have -- had we stayed there, something would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Much too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So one of -- one of her friend's husband -- the husband of one of her friends -- was that guide and he was a member of the Communist Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And he and his nephews and other people -- they were all local people -- they were smugglers, so they knew the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He -- he was involved in passing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And so he had a group of four French who were -- well, two French and two Gypsies -- the Gypsies also were starting to be rounded up -- who were -- they were coming -- going from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the next in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">At night they would walk in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And they would stop in a <span class="DLF">farm</span> or they would stop in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">A lot of local priests, country priests, were also involved in helping out people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">It didn't matter if they were -- if people were Jews or -- a lot of also were involved with pilots, who were shot down. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And so they had -- they had like a chain, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And those organizations were very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Very, very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They had to be very -- very -- how can I say that -- they had to choose who they were passing because they could be betrayed very easily, and many of them were betrayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  Were there other refugees living inthis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But amazingly enough, after -- after we talked to other people, one of the local people say "Oh, there is another Jewish family in hiding" -- I forgot where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So one day they were -- they came to visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They were much younger than my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And they- the wife was pregnant at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So I really don't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">But -- but the people knew that they were -- and I'm sure that there were other people in hiding there also, see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">QUESTION:  But you were pretty free to move around as you wanted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  We were pretty free to move until the -- that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">zone</span> became the red zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And then you needed a special pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And only the local people could get that. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">So -- so actually, we didn't move, we were all in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">We couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">From January or February of '43 until the day we left in April the 9th of '43, we didn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Except going in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">But my parents didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">My parents were -- my parents were not supposed to be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  How aware were you of these different resistance operations 1n the <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
