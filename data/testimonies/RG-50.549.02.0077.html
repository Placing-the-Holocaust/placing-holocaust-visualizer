<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Well, my -- my father and my mother were prominent citizens of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Baden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He was naturally the owner of the [German] which is not a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> like here, it’s a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">A-And he was a honorary commander of the first [indecipherable] organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He was also member of the democratic party, and my mother liked to be the society woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She -- they -- they went to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and concerts regularly and especially as long as we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , she had tea hours after lunch with friends from the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> or from the concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">People like the general director of the orchestra would come and have a cup of coffee and actors with whom my mother got friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Let’s see, one who would be prominent became Mrs. d’ Albert, the composer d’ Albert. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">She was his last of six or seven wives and he was a man who for each of his wives wrote an opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And she was -- Hilda d’ Albert was stubborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She wouldn’t get divorced, so there was no opera after the one he had written for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he died wa -- when I went to -- back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the first time, d’ Albert was -- she was living in a pensionne and I tried to see her, but without result. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She had a headache. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So it was quite a shock for my parents when the Nazis came. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They were not known as Jews, because only my father had a little bit of religion, my mother didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And we children, we had a frau -- fraulein, and whenever the fraulein changed, they took us to their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , wa -- if they went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> Sundays, and in general we had no -- no religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And only after the Nazi were her -- Nazis were here, I became definitely aware of what I was, and that both -- both my parents were Jewish, and I was trying to find a -- I had a membership card from the Jewish sports club, but I couldn’t find it. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="97">m slow, but what can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Have to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Now, what next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Did you have any extended family that were cl-close to you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Baden</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  If I go back to your childhood, you would, as a boy, not think of yourself as Jewish at all, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We didn’t now it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My sisters didn’t know it, and it came as a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Would there be any way in which you would observe Jewish holidays or any religious services at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  No, my -- my father would go once a year to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and I don’t remember whether I ever went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My first recollection actually of a Jewish services was when I lived on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> and that was pretty late. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But I made up for it to some extent by learning things, studying a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When I -- when -- after I had lost my job in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and stayed with my parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> for a few weeks, there was a man who was traveling around [indecipherable] a-around <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> collecting money for a <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical school</span> he wanted to start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenst</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenstein</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He was probably a crook, but was very interesting man. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He traveled with a companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He sa -- he said he was his cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And he got sick and I visited him in his pensionne -- <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where I was -- I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And that is where I recall first to get the first impression of the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He taught me that in contrast to all other religions, Jews can talk directly to their God, and that the basis 1s -- of their religion really, 10 commandments. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I’ve never forgotten it, I should have -- I should be er-grateful to him.

</span><span class="sentence" id="497">And decided to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I, at that time, was of the opinion that the man

in the east, we would meet early enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I had never met the man, his name was Edgar Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So the day I got that letter, I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , where I had an address of an attorney, I found out he’s quite a prominent attorney, to -- with whom to get in contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He was -- his wife was the sister of the man who had given me the affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And this was a time where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> was crowded with people working on the war effort, and if it hadn’t been for that recommendation, I would never have been able to get a <span

and to a concert, and showed me the -- where the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> were, and I was on my own for a couple of days, during which I found an <span class="BUILDING">employment

back and he said his brother’s insurance agency al-also needed a bookkeeper or accountant, and gave me the address, I should go there the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Naturally, that was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Even so the pay, as I afterwards found out, was very low for American purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But being recommended, I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on <span class="DLF">16" Street</span> , 1827 <span class="DLF">16"

id="512">It was an insurance agency and there were -- it was interesting for me because the bookkeeper, an old lady, had kept her records for the past couple of years at least, on pieces of paper and

<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I had no intention to do something else but accounting and naturally to write -- to find out how to become a CPA, especially after the experience in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , where I was unable to stay, to some extent also, because they wanted a -- what they in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> called a chartered accountant for the <span class="DLF">diamond mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I also registered in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It took a -- I went from one <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to the other because this was a time where all of the students were studying under the -- what they call the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They didn’t pay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I was the only paying student in <span class="BUILDING">American University</span> and that <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was favorable for me because the man who took care of foreign students was a former German and he was helpful to me in my studies for the years I was at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  So every <span class="BUILDING">local college</span> was -- <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was full of G.I. bills?</span></p>
