ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Do you want us to put your glasses on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  No, I need a prop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">July 23, 2009
ANSWER:  I don’t know how long it took for her to get me back, but I know I must have been about one — one and a half? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">One? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I have been trying to get information, but I haven’t gotten anything so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I do have a booklet that was given to my mother when they brought her — when they brought me to her, and it has the pictures of the women who — the nurses who took care of me, who were Swiss Red Cross nurses, and some pictures of different periods, which I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We — after ri — Rivesaltes, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tres</span> , and there I have very few memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">The first memory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I think it’s my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And there must have been a little mirror, because I remem — that’s the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And then I do remember Tres. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Not Tres, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , it was the end of the war, and there were a lot of air raids, and we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The one I remember particularly well was the time I locked myself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and the air raids went on and my mother went hysterical and my father had to break open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember we did go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> were very frightening, because they were very dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I always cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So there was a gentleman that I remember that we always used to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">His wife was blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">That I still remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And he taught me how to — taught me different songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And July 23, 2009 that, I guess, stopped my crying, which became a pain in the neck to everyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I remember the different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I remember being very spoiled by a lot of very different people. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I never had what my sister and brother had. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I never remember hunger, because I was never hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was frightened because no matter how young you are, people’s emotions do — do penetrate, and fear 1s very, very noticeable and affective. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It affects you. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So I was always frightened of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was always afraid of being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The other thing I remember is that I guess it was — it was a big Catholic organization, and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the nuns had very big headdresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I don’t know the order, but I remember we used to get hot chocolate there, or something like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And my mother — I was so s — very afraid of my mother leaving me, and being very — screaming very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Those are the things I remember, being very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So remember being in back of a woman, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> was a very, very rough <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , at that time especially, because it was near the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And walking — and we were walking behind a couple, and she had her bag over her wrist, and somebody just cutting the bag off. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And she stood there with just the strap, screaming, and we were not far behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I don’t know if my father was there, because he usually was very good at running after anybody who was — had to be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And that always, always stuck in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There was a couple who wanted to adopt me, and my mother said, no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was a friend of July 23, 2009 theirs, I— I don’t know, they just figured my mother had two children and they had none, and times were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And she said, probably, I don’t know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I know my friend — friends of ours that still live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> told Lucie about it when she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I don’t know who it was, someday I’ Il go, in the near future, because they’re rather old, and I have to go and see what they know. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Then I remember coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> after the war, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Things were very tough in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Work was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The anti-Semitism was horrible, very, very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span> , but because I was very rambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn’t care less, and I didn’t like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">There was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during the war, and they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they were going to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , eventually, or some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or stay in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And that made me very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And ultimately my mother was asked to find another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me, because I was such a wonderful child. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They were thrilled to see me go, and I was thrilled to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And the next <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to was an all-girls school. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was not a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , it was very — it was mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Very few Jews, and I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And the antisis — anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it’s a shame that they didn’t get you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I didn’t know what they were talking about, because my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My father never spoke July 23, 2009 about it til the day he died, til he had Alzheimer’s, then he went back through everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So he never spoke about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I never understood what she was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was — 1t was tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Then we came and what we did for entertainment was we went to the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I decided that, since I entertained everybody anyway — I used to put on accents — I had to do that, I felt, because everybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So I entertained. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> meant that I wanted to know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I was nine on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and it was — I was thrilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I was thrilled to come, til I came and I didn’t particularly care for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I was very homesick, I missed my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My parents did not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was all kept very quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and my father, who did not want to come, only wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My mother refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">She said that she was not going to have us taken away any more, and he had a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He either could come — because she had one sister left, that lived here — he had a choice; either he came with us, and she was going and she was taking us, or th — he could go and he’d never see us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn’t really the best thing for him, because he could never adjust very well to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And every day I thank her. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She did speak about it, ultimately, but he never, ever, ever spoke about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I never knew he was in the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I never knew that he had July 23, 2009 gotten people out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because he was a plumber, and he knew the underground works, where he had to fix things, and that’s how he got people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I never knew all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a wonderful father. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to play with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">She — my mother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma — young. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I remember her crying a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I remember her when her niece’s birthday and her nephews, or whoever, always having — we didn’t have very much money, but she always managed to get flowers next to their picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I always think — I always thought, I don’t get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Why do they”? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I always had a feeling — well, it’s my own insecurity, but I was always afraid that she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you — she got me out when I was one or two, how did she know it was me? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Who told her it was me? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Children change. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">How did she know? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We stayed at the HIAS when we came, and that was really a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was a lot of different people from a lot of different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and it was very much like a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , today, I would imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And my aunt felt that that really wasn’t proper for me, and I stayed with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I was — as I said, I was always very — my sister and brother do not want to think that I experienced anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">If I say I remember something, they’re very fast to either say, July 23, 2009 no you can’t, you’re too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They — it’s a form of protecting me, but it’s the way they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Sorry, that’s my phone, sorry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Pll shut it off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Shall I wait?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  For me the HIAS was very exciting, it was very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I thought, oh, what a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> , what a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But I soon — and then we moved to <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But there were always things lingering, there was always this heaviness that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , there were a lot of — which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , there were a lot of refugees there, and it’s funny how you click. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And that’s what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Even later on you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that that was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">She was put up as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And that reinforced my feeling that, oh I— I know she’s not my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I remember thinking — and I know, because I was such a difficult child. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I was difficult also because she was 43 when she had me. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I was not exactly what you call a planned child. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I remember thinking, yeah, if I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna have somebody like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I look just like her. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But that could be with adopted child as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I am ju — I am very July 23, 2009 much like her, and I know, I know that who — that I’m not. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Not that it would matter anyway, after a certain age. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">As a mother she was a fantastic mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She let me live and be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of — who are survive — children of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Because they burden — there is a burden on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There is a— a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it comes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too much, because they were upset enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But all in all they were — she really did a phenomenal job. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">She is the reason why we’re alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She is the one who masterminded everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was stopped by Gestapo, and she was — and he looked at her and he said, I will let you go this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So things like that did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">She did not — one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for anything that happened before. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And that I’m thrilled about, because I do have friends that are everything different. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">As I said, she didn’t put all the ugliness on me, but unfortunately we do that ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I don’t — I’m very careful who I speak to about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I don’t watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And you get your own things that you have to live through and work through, but I didn’t have the hardship that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">For that, I’m lucky too. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And that’s my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">July 23, 2009
QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You are happy that came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and you have a life here. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">What you talked about, talent for entertaining, and — that might have come from the need to —
ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Can you tell me one of the things you — what your career was, what — what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I was a lab technician, hematology lab technician like my sister, because my mother wanted me to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But when I — as soon as I made a little money, I went to tech — I went — decided to try to do acting, cause I did it all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So I went to — had a wonderful technique teacher, Anthony Menino, have you ever heard of him? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Anthony Menino? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">Herbert Berghof studios</span> , and I studied with Bill Hickey(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And I did plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I did different things, nothing major. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Then I got married and for some reason I thought that if I had children I had to be with them, which was stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But I also didn’t have the need that I had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I’m sorry I didn’t pursue it more, but there were obstacles when I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My brother, I remember telling my father, you have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She can’t go to <span class="BUILDING">acting school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You know what’s in <span class="BUILDING">acting schools</span> , they’re all sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And a few other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And my father smiled and let him talk and he says, you do what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I did, and it was wonderful, I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I really enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I always said someday I’Il do it July 23, 2009 again, and I just — I’ve done small things, but nothing like I really wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That’s my fault, no one stopped me except me. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But I found that it’s a great thing to do, especially when I was little, because it really made life so much more bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I used to go to the movies, watch what they did and I copied the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The only thing that I remember that really I’m thrilled about, when my father was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , when he was — had Alzheimer’s, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you know who I am? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And he said yes — and this didn’t happen very often — you’re my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I remember how you — and I — I remember all the accents you used to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And one of them was the Hungarian accent, and of course we spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So it was an imitation of the Hungarian Jewish neighbor, and he found it very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And strange, when he was very ill, different things did come out, like sleeping with his shoes, because he’d have to run and hide, used to tell us to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But that was — you know, with every hardship and with every horrible thing, there is some good, and there is some nice things that you can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">For the longest time I couldn’t think of my father because I didn’t want to think of him that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Took a long time, and now I can think of it, and I can think of the nicer parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">For someone who did so much good, sad to think that that had to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But, you know, we’re not privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The only way I found out about his family was that we found a cousin in <span class="REGION">California</span> who was really — who’s like my third cousin or second cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And she July 23, 2009 knew all about his grandmother and his — and my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I had no idea about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I had no idea about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I found out that my great-grandmother had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for girls and taught them how to read, in a ghetto structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But I never knew all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I never knew anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It’s almost like being adopted, when you don’t know who your grandparents are really. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You don’t know — you don’t have any aunts and uncles, you don’t have any cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There’s no one there. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The reason we’re So close is because that’s it, that was what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That’s who we had to rely on, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There was no one else. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And then we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I had an aunt, and she had — but her children were much older than — because she was my mother’s oldest sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And she decided that we were too European, she really didn’t want too much of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">She was a little mentally deranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And we didn’t see her that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So there was never anyone until I got married, and I did marry into a very large family, and I found that very, very comforting, because my children always had cousins and friends and — and the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And it was lovely.</span></p>
