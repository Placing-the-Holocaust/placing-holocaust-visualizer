<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">October 16, 2010
ANSWER:  It was the — then — the guy was Alfred Krupp, from the <span class="BUILDING">Krupp factory</span> , munitions maker and <span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials and I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, who was the prosecutor for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I attended one of these meetings; they said, as you investigate, you gotta look for two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Cri — preparing for and conducting aggressive warfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">That we found Krupp, because he was building <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and stuff like that, and testing them, and things of that nature — other war material. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The other one was crimes against humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And this ma — old man, Krupp —and I have a lot of his personal history, to — was in — retired, I think because of health reasons, about the same t — about the time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So that’s before slave labor because a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And his son took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So — and he and his son didn’t get along at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so he had — the — the old man didn’t have anything to do with the operation of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , or their personnel, or policies. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He was there collecting his retirement pay, and that’s about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">In fact, it’s an interesting situation, that this guy is, when he was born, was not — his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp, who was very big before World War I, who built up the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> a lot, Alfred Krupp, and he ha — only had daughters, he had no sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But he wanted to perpetuate the name and the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of the Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">October 16, 2010 So he maintained his nobility name, but he main — he kept his — kept the Krupp name in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So there was a special edict, I don’t know what year that was done, but it’s an interesting situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Yeah, it is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  And I used to have si — copy of his — I used to have his passport for a while.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Were there any other cases, like war crime trials that you worked on? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The cr — the Krupp case and —
ANSWER:  Yeah, that was the only one for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But then I worked for — well, again by the pe — if I talk about things you know, I me — stop me. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">During the Yalta Conference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people who were involved on an international basis, who were supposed to be tried by the <span class="BUILDING">international court</span> , which were then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But things had happened, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or slave labor, in the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> whose zone of occupation was — was war crimes against individuals of that nationality, were supposed to be tried by <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> of that ka — courts of that cor — of that nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">For instance, again, there’s an interesting history which is — don’t know whether — how well known that was, when the — when the — when — during the fighting, U.S. troops got as far as the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elba river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That meant they went past — through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thuringen</span> where the ca — main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is October 16, 2010 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , and where also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was located there, just nearby there. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And then, after the — they rearranged the <span class="REGION">zones</span> and — and that area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> became <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So, since we had the evidence, like lampshades made from human bl — from human skin, and SS guards and oth — and all kind of stuff, including the wife of the former commandant, Ilse Koch, and — more about her later. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I said I have a long history of — [indecipherable] history. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And so — so we moved before our troops withdrew from that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and the Russians moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We took all the stuff and put it into a <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage facilities to store the evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And there was a mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Since — since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was supposed to be tried by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and since this is the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , we — we had a team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all that stuff that had been collected, and they — the lawyers put it into a legal documentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But the wi — Russians refused to accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They did not want to annoy the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It’s in their <span class="REGION">zone</span> , they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> look bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So they refused to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And so about — that was before Churchill spoke about the Iron Curtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">That was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> did not live up to its commitment under the Yalta Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So it’s — for many years later — about two years later they would — the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I participated in that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were October 16, 2010 there, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">The U.S. trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And one of the most in — at times I wasn’t sure I was going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">For a while I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and was [indecipherable] court interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Was sometimes assistant to the judge, because they had terms, which different people translated different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And they were — the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to them, what — how it happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And then I had to figure out these were the same — translating 1t back into German, these were the same organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So, and — but there was — there was some interesting people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Probably the most famous — one of the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto Skorzeny. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Did you ever heard about that name’? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Otto Skorzeny was the commander of the German Ranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">In fact, he became famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">After the Italian partisans had ca- captured Mussolini and kept him on top of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> as a prisoner, his ranger unit, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> and with mountain troops, stormed that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and rescued Mussolini. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but — but that was the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge, because he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them all in German — in American uniforms, to go behind our <span class="DLF">lines</span> — through our <span class="DLF">lines</span> and disturb things, maybe destroy signal equipment and put on markers, direction signs, turn them around and to ca — and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge, October 16, 2010 the aim of the Rumsted(ph) offensive was to capture <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And he was an important part, but he was being tried — tried [indecipherable] for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But there was an interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> , who had — he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense counselor in war crimes trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because there was a guy who was — I don’t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he had some lawyer assistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And he found out that you cannot get anybody on espionage, or sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">These are ruses of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">As long as you are not — as long as you are caught — not caught in the other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ’s uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">There were some of his men who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But he was caught later on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Therefore that stopped it and he was acquitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And then he became other things, he was — became the chief of security for <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He was sometimes — there was a — were some articles written, the most dangerous man in Europe, because he had that wartime experience, and he was helping <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But didn’t do much good. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Egyptians didn’t do so well in the Six Day War. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But — so, and then there was also, during the Buchenwald trial, there was this wa — wa — fo — the widow of the commandant, and she had been a widow for many years, but she was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And they tried to find out whether it was a Polish guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">There were — a lot of the guard people were Polish DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they were all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And the Americans pretty well liked them, the only per October 16, 2010 — only one person didn’t like the Polish guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">There was th — my dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He always barked at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And he was a interesting dog.</span></p>
