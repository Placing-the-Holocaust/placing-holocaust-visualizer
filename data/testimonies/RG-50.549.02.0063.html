ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Is that how you pronounce it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And I wanted you to say, first of all, something about your family’s history in that <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  We live in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , my aunts, and my -- not only my parents, my grandparents were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And we were ver -- respected citizens of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My grandfather, and my father were running a business, and eventually my brothers helped also, alongside. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The business was a processing of feathers, and down, which they exported from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and -- and several <span class="REGION">European countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And during the peace time, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a very small -- I’m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and primarily Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I -- I lived there for my first, let’s say 12" -- 12 years or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Subsequently, I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  I -- ’'m sorry, I’m going to interrupt you a little bit --
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  -- because I don’t want you to feel like you have to repeat what you talked about in the video. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My -- the reason that I asked you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wodzislaw</span> is that I wondered -- your -- your family had a long history in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I wondered if you -- after the war, you felt a sense of connection with the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , if you ever visited again. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Anything more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The only connection about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was that I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> only one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">This was a dozen years ago, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I think maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">There was a first march of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> a-and Birkenau, The March of the Living. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I -- I was one of them, and there were many others from <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , even <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There were about 2,000 young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="22"><span class="BUILDING">College</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">college</span> or <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> age. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And it was a very moving experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There were very -- dignitaries from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and the former president, Ithzrak Navonne. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it’s -- was extremely moving, and very, very upsetting, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons, Andrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c- cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">They had all kinds of preparations, invited us to the <span class="BUILDING">Senate building</span> , gave a couple parties, you know, cocktail parties, where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">One of the Russian generals spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And also they per -- had a -- performed a Jewish show in one of their <span class="BUILDING">Senate</span> -- what do call them there, <span class="BUILDING">Senate building</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> there, a <span class="BUILDING">theater building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in -- in the -- in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very impressed with her singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I ask her how did she learn that, she was quite a young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and he -- he survived the war, and he had a lot of records, and she learned it from the records, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I remember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about 40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he gave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they lived there for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspects, you know, were completely eradicated, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There’s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a matter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them what my parents used to do, say, “Why don’t you come back, we will build a <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> , we’ll do this and that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Ithzrak Navonne said, “Too little, too late.” </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He spoke very fluent English. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He said, “What happened,” and give all kinds of dates, “when the Jewish people came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , as they came to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> , what happened to them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He said, “Oh well, it’s a different regime.” </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He asked, during certain dates, you know, so the -- there were all kinds of ordinances, you know, and if people came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they would -- they were either shot, or they had to flee <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were occupied by Polish people, and they didn’t want to -- they felt they may want to reclaim their property. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So they had to flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mine, he and two other people came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was all mostly demolished, but they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, they stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So one late afternoon, they knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and my friend opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So the other two left, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So my memories about it, is I would never want to go back there again. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">As a matter of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was there, with my son -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wodzislaw</span> , my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we rented a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we escorted to the cem -- I didn’t remember where the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> is -- the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , and there was not o-one tombstone [indecipherable] not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And there was a -- young kids, who were -- they saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They came over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what happened to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They were teenagers, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Oh, well they were demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And they -- you want to see res -- where the tombstones are? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They were -- they made <span class="DLF">walkways</span> out of them, they made <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> [indecipherable] <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  You had family, I assume -- you had family who was buried there, I assume?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I had f -- my grandparents were buried there, and other relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Did you -- while you were there, did you see any people -- any Gentiles you had known before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  No, but I did meet some pe -- a couple who helped -- that couple -- these were children of people were -- my parents and three sisters, and two children were -- were hiding for a couple months. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And the parents were not alive, but I’ve been in touch with the daughter of -- and the son-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They came to visit me, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and we met in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Of course, I was very warm to them, and I gave them a certain as -- cert-certain- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was a substantial amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So a -- they appreciate it, and they -- they do write, send me a Christmas card, or -- or write to me from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  You mentioned this family in your first interview, and -- and you also mentioned that they had -- they had disappointed you and your family by really not -- by asking for more and more money when they were hiding, and -- and behaving somewhat --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  -- less than honorably. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I’m wondering how you felt about meeting with them after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  I still f -- had a -- I would say a warm feeling for them, because they did risk their lives by helping, and the money, obviously, ha -- we had -- 1 -- if I -- I do remember that, we had a manager in one of our plants in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , you know, manager who managed the feather and down business. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He would go every two weeks to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and make sure how -- how my parents are, and my -- and the -- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And he would give money to that family for food, and other things, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I don’t know how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My father felt 1f he has a money with him [indecipherable] the money wasn’t so much valuable any more, but they would keep some jewelry, or some gold coins, or whatever, just for emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He was afraid that if he gives it all in one time, maybe the guy -- they were na -- she was always so -- they weren’t sure, maybe, he would get tired of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And it became also, very impossible to live there for a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Was in November, was very cold, they were in -- actually hidden in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , in an <span class="DLF">orchard garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And two little children, they were tall -- they were taught not to speak, and not to cry or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It was quite a horrible scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  I had a question about the manager, too, who had been helping out your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Was he non-Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  He was non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He was a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He worked for us for many years, was a very loyal person. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But right after the war, the German put a trustee, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They took out all the inventory and shipped it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But certain materials, they wanted to be processed there, so that manager worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He taught them. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And subsequently, one of my brothers worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That -- he felt 1f he helps them and -- and so on, he will survive -- it’Il be easier for him to survive the war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But it didn’t help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did you have contact with him after the war, an-and what was his name, with the manager?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Yes, but we lost con -- he must have passed away after. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We did write to him, and a matter of fact, we -- from -- at that time we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and we send him packages, you know, of certain delicacies, you know, which was not available in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But then we st -- we couldn’t hear from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">His name was Sh-Sh-Trzyna -- T-r-z-y-n-a.

<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Pm -- ’'m wondering, obviously, it was extremely disappointing how little the -- y-y- you had had -- you mentioned in your first interview that your family had had good friends before the war, who were non-Jewish, and that they didn’t, for the most part, help during --during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Didn’t help at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">None of them helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The only one is that manager who tried to help as much as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And that family who were hiding our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But they did it also for money, because before we vacated -- before we knew it’s going to be very tragic, because we heard wa -- also, there were very little communications, we had no radio, no newspapers, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Couldn’t travel to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But there were rumors that -- and there -- some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , it was very -- the Germans came in, and took a lot of people out, or most of the Jewish people, because they killed some officer, some soldiers, which was just an excuse, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But we heard all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My parents arranged to -- with these Gentile friends, they said, in case of a problem -- that we have a problem, we want to -- we w -- would like to hi -- you to help us, we would like to hide there. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they gave him a lot -- a lot of silver, and anything that was valuable in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">S- Special linen, flatware, you know, stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Whatever they could take out, even some art. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We emptied everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So this was like a compensation. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">In addition, we made sure we paid them for the f-food, and we pay -- also f -- whatever else he asked for, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It -- but still, wi -- I feel with all that, he was a decent human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you, regarding that -- that experience of -- of real disappointment with the fact that these people who had been your friends before the war, really abandoned you and your family, an-and so many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">How do you --
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I had <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and none of them really cont-contacted me, I mean even when still was pretty quiet, they all stayed away, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  How do you -- do you feel trusting now, of -- I mean, after having that experience, do you feel that -- that as a Jew, you can really trust -- as a Jew living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and as a minority --

<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  -- an -- do you feel you can trust the majority to do what’s right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Positively, I wa -- I -- am -- definitely would trust -- it’s a different system, you know, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it’s a democratic system, and every citizen has it’s rights, and the Constitution protects every cit-citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">S -- but in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , although the Jewish people lived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there’s -- in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wodzislaw</span> , there’s a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which was over a thousand years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But during the war years, it was -- made a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And everything was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">As a matter of fact, I was told it’s being rebuilt now, they want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The -- the Polish people in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it is, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they were shooting in front of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were -- we were hiding in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that we owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And finally they came to our <span class="DLF">door</span> , they were <span class="DLF">steel doors</span> , they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in German, “Get out, you [indecipherable] get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You know, and eventually we had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They were beating us, and we had to run to a square. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then, they shot several people, put some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So people didn’t come out, they put them on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And we are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it’s couple thousand, or several thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So once they left, my parents felt th-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , you know, that we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So what -- my parents said, “Let’s go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , there’s a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> nearby.” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we were there only minutes, I don’t know, less than a half hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The priest himself, in charge, he said, “You Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,” you know, “get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And actually pushed us out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Said, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you know, who lived <span class="NPIP">outside</span> -- a little far out -- outs -- outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We stayed there for overnight, a couple nights, I don’t remember, a few days, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I t calmed down, so we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We got -- we got no help, really, to speak of. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would report them, you know?
