<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  And when and where were you born?</span></p>

QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  500 years, 1500 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And they came and my family was there with, there were two branches, so to speak, from my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And my grandfather on my mother’s side was named Marcus. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But my father on his side, he was named Avraham or Abraham. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Marcus 1s https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 a name that comes from the Jews were in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> after the destruction of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So they basically moved toward the east from there into Europe and perhaps to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And so for instance, one connection is that Marx the famous or infamous Communist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Karl Marx.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Karl Marx was based on the fact that his people were called Marcus. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And but the Germans made it into Marx and so that’s, so my grandfather was, his family name, last name was Marcus. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So that was my connection there. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">This little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I mentioned where I was born was actually a center of a lot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Romanian villages</span> who were working the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And they were raising <span class="DLF">crops</span> and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , acted -- there were 400 Jewish people there, mostly merchants who actually brought and bought from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> to give to their customers who were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So my father had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with fabrics. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">In those days there were no ready-made clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You had to buy the, by the meter or <span class="DLF">yard</span> and you went to a tailor and so on or to see what they call it mistress and so my father brought the stuff from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And sold a lot of, from silk and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Even British cloth that came from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And also a variety of fabrics that were actually made in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">A lot of <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> that did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So my father whose story is also of interest, at least to me, he had been during the First World War he was about the age of 14, 15 and had worked in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> of an uncle of his who kind of exploited him so at one point he decided to go on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And there was a war and the Romanians fought against the Germans, the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And he decided to go with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and one horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And he went and bought from the Germans and sold it to the Romanians and bought from the Romanians and sold it to Germans, food basically and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And he managed to three or four years to make a lot of money, came back to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was born, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podu Turkului</span> and started a regular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> on fabrics and that was his, and he became quite successful, basically the most successful among all the other merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And his philosophy was, if I can put that in, was to buy as cheap as possible, meaning and how did you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">By putting the money on the spot, not on credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And he sold to all the villagers that came there on credit, because they didn’t have money every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Only after the crops came in, they had their money to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And they came and they were extremely good customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They never defaulted. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 came and paid and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">For many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Even during the Second World War that something happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">This little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> —

<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  We had been talking about what as a child when you saw German, German soldier, what reactions you had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Yeah [as they, as I said they started retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They hadn’t been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They came from the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So they, but there was a whole army. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So they started going to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they thought they are going to exit the <span class="DLF">road</span> away from the coming Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So they started doing that and lo and behold the Russians had been smarter than they. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And they are waiting for them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So there is a little bit of skirmish and then they retreated back and they went to another <span class="DLF">road</span> they thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Well they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Again. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So we heard the sounds of firing and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Somehow I found myself outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">My parents were there but everybody was worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Ok what’s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took a walk and what do I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 I see a German soldier on his back dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He had a face like yellow, dark yellow and blood coming from his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I looked at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Why I didn’t start running or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And that was one of my experiences seeing and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I wasn’t scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So that was my reaction and then to finish the story about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They got some prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They didn’t kill them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They, meaning the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So some were caught and they were put in behind barbed wire in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> so on but they weren’t killed so that’s not what the Germans did to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They killed prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It’s well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And so that was one of my experiences at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And the Russians came, were passing through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And now this skirmish 1s finished and so on and some Germans escaped and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The Russians army came more in bulk. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And once more I was coming, getting out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to see where the Russians were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">There was on the <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> and so on, they were passing with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So I went there and I saw indeed this group of tremendous group of, they were just going. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">They were shouting now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So as I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">This is something that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I’m not sure that this is a proud thing to say but I was, I saw some people coming from a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was a government building. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The government at the time, Romanian government had the power to sell tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Nobody could sell tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So everything came to this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that was government. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And the tobacco was not cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Just packages with tobacco that you made the cigarette and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I knew about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And that was 1944 so I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I look. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I let me go and I saw people coming out in boxes, wooden boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I was just in shorts and so on, in sandals and a cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Go and I see people taking this and go out with boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And then I hear shouting. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I was still <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I hear shouting and then a shot or several shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">To the <span

wanted tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They call it tabak. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And so the people who were there who were adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Romanian, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I didn’t know anybody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">They got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They were afraid to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I wasn’t afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So I take a box myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And I couldn’t carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I had to roll it. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">It was a kind of a cube. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Not a barrel, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It’s just a box, a wooden box with the shape of a cube. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So I managed to get down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> there on a side <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> was here and this was a side, small <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was nobody there because everybody were in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and by that time when they heard the shots there. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And I started rolling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And my mother, my father said what did you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And but I was there, with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">That meant money. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Because when they opened up and saw there was all these packages of tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And so my brother was two years old and so on, said he is going to https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 take a bag of this and sell it to the Russians soldiers for rubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And he did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And that, with that money we kind of, my father started a business again in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and managed to recover.

no reason to bring soldiers and so on and officers who were actually nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And so we crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> is on the <span

id="886">We couldn’t go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so we are taken over by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shuttle</span> kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , over the, to cross from one side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , because there was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">So we did and another

id="891">https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 They organized huge breads, round breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They cut pieces and they had very well organized, amazingly.

we hear another shout and another guy comes but he was after that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And Shlomo was a bigger guy than I. I was kind of short in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I grew up later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I said Shlomo, let’s go a little faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">He said no I’m tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Well I said let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">But nothing really https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So we came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> stops in the, toward the exit, stops, came from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mefratz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And he sees us there, two little youngsters there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">He opens the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">We said we don’t have money, ein kessef [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">He said (foreign language sentence — Hebrew?) </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">You’re stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Don’t you know what happened today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">It’s this and Arabs are attacking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">They are mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So and he took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yagur</span> and let us off there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And then later on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> came, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kibbutz bus</span> and we ended up in the kibbutz safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">But that was the experience that —
QUESTION:  What about in 48 when the state was declared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">ANSWER:  Well that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I was still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And we were left and since the army was in, just started and so on, we were about like 17 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">But they were not taking people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> because they needed the food that was, there was no other way just to import and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">So they didn’t take youngsters like myself at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">So we were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Later on basically in 1949, but for us, this was, I must say this because the feeling that you had in those days when the, one may say oh we were scared right and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Something is going to be war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">We knew that this 1s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">They didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">We didn’t care one bit about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">What we were, this, after 2000 years we have our state and this experience is something that nothing else in my life can be as that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">To hear it, we are back after all this and being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I’m sure many other Jews in <span class="NPIP">outside</span> felt equally but we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">We were there in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so we have been there, as I said for about three years and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">So in 1949 our group was getting, we are by now 18 and excuse me, at kibbutz Arti which is the organization of Hashomer Hatzair, decided to put us to send this group, instead of leaving us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">HaShofet</span> , they decided that they have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to send us, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called Gan Shmuel Al Kibbutz, Gan Shmuel Alomir Hadera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And why because the people there were elderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">They were not even Hashomer Hatzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So in the past a year or two or three years before that another group came in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hashomer Hatzair</span> so the kibbutz would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">But they weren’t enough people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">So they decided because it was political as well to have so take this group, Kevrat Udem that was our name, bring us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And so they decided that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">We were all sad and later we found out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was sad as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And we go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">So in the meantime, this three and a half years we’ve learned all sorts of things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We worked, we studied and I worked in the https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , the fruit and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And became an expert on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">But I learned also mechanical things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I remember carrying on my back a 200 pound sack of stuff over some, and so on, to put it in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">It was ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">It was we were proud of doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">We learned how to be on a rope and go up and down on a rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">That was the British army way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">That is the best way that ever and I still can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So we are proud of all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">But we come to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">We didn’t know where we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They were stranger to us and they behaved not like strangers, but like bitter toward us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They put us to do the, also to things that only us to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And so and we had a man who is our supervisor, Madrek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">We didn’t know that he was really a communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And he is allowed to steal this probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And at one meeting with him and so on, we started complaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">What are you doing to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We have mech to ot [ph] meaning we have learned how to do this and you are sending us only to do only that work and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And you’re not treating us properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> it wasn’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">We, if you learn something that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">You could do what you learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">So they put us in some old, not <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And crowded and everything was so, when I was one of those complaining And I said that that’s not nice what you are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And he said, if you don’t like it you can leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And at that time, at the same time I said that’s exactly what I’m going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">The next day or two days after I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadera</span> and I enlisted in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And but the army said you have to come a week from now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So I, where do I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit, to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I have not one penny in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">So I come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I don’t know even how I, how did I come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">There were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> but sometimes you could do hitchhiking and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">So I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And he found out that I was back and he said to me, you cannot eat in the Hadera Ocher, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">You should get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">But my friends who were still there they came and brought me the food from there and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And survived and it was only two of us who did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I and another member, Zev, Zev and Godol there were two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">One is small (inaudible) and we enlisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And then a week later we were taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadera</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we trained, real

QUESTION:  How long were you in the army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">ANSWER:  Four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And I was supposed to be really only two years but they said you can enter into https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 the regular army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">You can continue if you want and then you are a member of the Sva Keva, the regular army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So I stayed because my parents had just arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">It was like 1950 and I stayed in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I went into the air force, not as a pilot or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">They sent me to the adjutant general of the air force which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> , ok, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jafo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And I worked on kind of a, what can I call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">An organizer, not the community organizer, but in the time that was, we work on making units of the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And the air force was interested to have, from the reserves, because there were people in the reserves to actually organize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">We didn’t have, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> but we didn’t have <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> for instance where you could go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Negev</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> so the idea was if they want to bring help to our troops somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">We need to have that to build an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and you are very smart in doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I was designing at the time just young as I was, put together people and so on in this, in making groups and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">That from the reserve people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">The reserves they are until you are 50 years old, you are still in the reserves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So I worked like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">In the meantime, I was allowed, rather the army put together after work, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235"><span class="BUILDING">Evening schools</span> to get the group, to finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which I started in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> but that was not, I didn’t have a — so that actually was the way that within the last two years I went and I got, I went to the exams, external exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">But at the same — that was exactly like the ones given in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And the same questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And I succeeded very well due to my teachers and I, at the end of that, in 1950, was I started, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I was accepted for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> and studied there for my degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">QUESTION:  In what <span class="DLF">field</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">ANSWER:  I started in physics and that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">At the time, they were, they didn’t have a bachelor’s degree there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So you had at least in the mathematics and physics and so on, and chemistry, the hard sciences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Maybe others as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I don’t know but you had to get a master’s degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">A master’s degree meant that you had to write a thesis as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And so I did all that and I got my master’s degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">After four years at the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">In fact later on when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I realized that what I have done for my master’s degree was considered, could have been considered here as a PhD thesis, because it was different standards at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And in fact some of the people who didn’t do it, they didn’t get their degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">They https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 didn’t do that in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">They didn’t get their degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So they went, they did something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So that was my —
QUESTION:  So then you finished at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and then what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1257">ANSWER:  Well I started, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> because there was somebody there who was looking for somebody like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">He was an American guy who had got his PhD at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">MIT</span> in engineering, but nuclear engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And he was at the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> and he said he needed somebody with knowledge of what was the modern physics, quantum mechanics, stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And he accepted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And he was supposed to lead to a PhD, given by the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">But we didn’t quite see eye to eye in one sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I was trained in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> , particularly mathematics at a level that <span class="BUILDING">MIT</span> didn’t have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And very few of <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , the best <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> in the world we had that kind of training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And this man really didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">So when I would, he gave me a topic to, and so on, to go into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I studied the literature and so on and what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And I would come to him with my results. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And so the one time that I present to him, he said no what you wrote here on the lab work, it’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And you failed that (inaudible) true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And he got red in the face and then I said I’m going to prove it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">So that was the end with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">So he comes back to me a little later on, not that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">You know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">You should sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">You should go to the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> and get your PhD there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So how do I do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I mean I have no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">My parents don’t have money to send me there or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">So well they had advertised at the time, in 1959 they advertised that they are looking for people in physics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And to apply, <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were applying and how come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Where did they get the money? </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">The money came from the armed services because if you recall the Sputnik, everybody was scared that the Russians have taken over and so on and they really didn’t have enough people in those hard sciences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">So they were putting this throughout the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">I applied to one of the, it was one was <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and they said at the time, they sent me back yes, I am acceptable but not for the very first semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">In September. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">But if I wait, I’m accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And only one other <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> said come on over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">So of course I, and they were going to give me a salary to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Well what other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> does that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">Of https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 course I came and I again separated from my parents and my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And I arrived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">At the time the foreign currency in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was so tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">They would give you 120 dollars to one, at the time if you leave and don’t know to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">So my parents bought the ticket and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I had a little bit of money and —
QUESTION:  Did you know English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">ANSWER:  By that time, yes, yeah because I used English at <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> and also shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> with a guy from <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , a Jewish guy who was also a student there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And so it helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And I learned in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> that’s a little bit of another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">How I learned English there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">I said there were Americans, and particularly my professor, teacher, Josef Vilfand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">He got his degree here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Himself was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , came with his widowed mother here and he managed to go and study and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Got his master’s degree in literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">So he, I said I want to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">So he said ok, he gave me some things to do and so on and ultimately said oh here is Encyclopedia Britannica junior and here 1s an article about coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And translate it into Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">So I did, so I did and he would check, do these things and that’s how I learned English so I wasn’t yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">But I became really very easily here to —
QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1315">QUESTION:  For how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1316">ANSWER:  Well I was there 1960 and I was there until 1964 so I got my degree and PhD and I had my advisor was a guy named George Weiss, he was Jewish and religious Jew too and he lives not far away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">It’s an amazing situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And we at the time when I finished it was quite a different, difficult time with jobs for physicists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">It’s amazing within a short time this situation has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Because with the ride to the moon and so on, there suddenly they said only reach that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">There’s no more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">So whatever you tried to get a job they said we are firing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And indeed that was a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">1966. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">So I got also the little jobs in between 1964 and 66. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Finally I https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 managed to get a job with a company in, Raytheon company in way back on what is the name, <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And I worked for them and I was doing work, what they were interested of just actually was supported by the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">I didn’t know that at the time that the Navy, and but it was deltoid problems in the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And I was there for about, but I’m actually before, before that actually I had a benefit of working after I got my PhD, the National Research Council awarded me a three year salary to work at <span class="BUILDING">NASA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And actually I have all this stuff here that my documents, ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">I’m not saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So I worked at <span class="BUILDING">NASA</span> in <span class="REGION">Greenbelt Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And that was very interesting and I actually this was basically before, a little bit before I got my PhD. And I finished my PhD and submitted a thesis to the, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span> and I was working at the time at NASA. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And among the people on the committee that the final thing you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">You give talk about you show them your PhD and thesis and so on and they ask questions and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And there was one guy from the committee that was part of the faculty at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">In the Physics, nuclear physics and he said to some people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Wait a minute in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">This is not physics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">That is what you did is mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Why because my advisor was a mathematician, applied mathematician so actually he did work on <span class="REGION">areas</span> that were connected with physical things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And what I’ve done were I worked for NASA and I worked on things that were, dealt with what are called solar flares from the sun ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And things that hadn’t been done before except in my work at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">So as I’m there and he’s talking like that and then my advisor gives a talk to my boss at NASA, Dr. McDonald. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And that guy hears about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Comes immediately from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenbelt</span> and comes to this meeting and he talks what do you mean mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">This man has worked here on this and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And so the committee decided that I deserved the PhD.
QUESTION:  It was kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">You worked how long for Raytheon and then what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1350">ANSWER:  OK so but I was still, then at that point I forgot to mention this, the order of the, I was with I worked for NASA and now I had my PhD. So because they liked what I was doing they said ok, you can stay with us for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">They couldn’t hire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">I wasn’t a citizen so they said you can work because the National Research Council will give you a two year, they’|l pay my salary which was not a few dollars, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">It was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And I said ok that’s fine with me and I stayed there two years and I did some more work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">And published and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And at some point I was really https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 decided that I really didn’t want to continue because the reason is that I as a physicist when I look at astrophysics as it’s called today like with NASA was involved but we actually were, NASA was involved really in a real problems that had an impact on the, by the so called astrophysics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">It was kind of not something realistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I liked my work to be applied to something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And it wasn’t with the exception of these things that were really important to study those because communications 1s actually affected by solar flares, these things that happened every 11 years or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">And it was important for the air force for the military and even for NASA to know what is going to happen in such a case if you send a signal for instance, it can be affected by and really ruin it and that is not something that you want to have when you are in say war or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">So I decided I want to go in, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that will let me do things that are applicable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And I looked around and one of my friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> said oh why don’t you come over here to this company in <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span> and <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">He was working for the Navy at the time and said well Raytheon may, and indeed they hire me and I was with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And I worked on problems and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I have even here my, what I did for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And then that particular one collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Gail Schwartz: this is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Phillip Abraham. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">This is track number 3 and you were talking about working for Raytheon in <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">Phillip Abraham: Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">I worked there and problems that had to do with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">How to make sure that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> is not sunk by some missile or detected by an adversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And this means that there 1s sound in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">It’s not like the sound that we hear in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">But that can propagate through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> thousands of miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And in the process may hit an object like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And reflect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And if there is somebody there waiting with their own sensors they say oh there is something there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And they can determine sometimes what that something is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">So I worked on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And I did, I in my opinion and others I did good work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">But this was a little https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 company part that I was working in on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And it was actually given money for that research by the office of Naval Research in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> because it was an important need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">So but they didn’t, the company itself didn’t put money into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And suddenly the money that came from this part of, from the Navy stopped because in other projects they didn’t provide what they were expected to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">So they cut them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And Raytheon decided to close this <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And now I’m without a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">And as I said, this was like it’s like 1968, something like that. </span><span

QUESTION:  Was your wife American or from Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1394">ANSWER:  No she was an American yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">And we met through the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">She was at the <span class="BUILDING">American University</span> when I was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> and somebody said oh you should meet this and so on and we met and we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">So we had, we have two children, a daughter and a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">Of course my daughter is close to 44 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And my son is just 41, 42, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">And so that was, I was in a, and I was at the time, I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New London</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> because that’s where Raytheon group was there, that particular group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">Even though they are in <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">So I’m looking and I’m looking and trying to find a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Finally I visited the <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> , the physics department and I see something there, maybe on the bulletin board outdoors that they were interested in something like physicists or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">So I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I met somebody named like Paul Clemens, a Jewish guy who got actually born in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , but had been in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , got his degree there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And he was the head of the physics department at <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">So he said well you know I, we don’t have a spot on the faculty but I can arrange for you to be here as a research associate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Some salary is better than nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">So I moved there to basically <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> is the <span class="DLF">College Park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Sorry, not <span class="DLF">College Park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">What is it called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 Something, it escapes me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">In any case, I moved to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and with my family and I was there for several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">And they didn’t have a real lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for me to become a real —
QUESTION:  Professor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1415">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And on the faculty so I had to make do with a job still with the <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> but not at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hartford</span> they had a kind of a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">branch</span> up there and I taught there, undergraduates and some graduates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And ultimately I escaped that because there was no hiring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And finally I looked around and my friends who were in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and they said maybe you want to work for, let’s see what did I do there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">I was in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">There is a place that can hire you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New London</span> that 1s not <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">It’s the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">And that, and I went for an interview and they hired me and I had to give some talks and so on and they hired me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">And I was there for eight years as a member and I became, of course not a temporary but and with pension plan and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">And then I decided to move elsewhere and something happened also in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">We got a divorce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">So I moved from there to right here in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> basically and the <span class="BUILDING">Naval Research Laboratory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">You probably heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And I arrived there and I was a member of the Naval and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And they started doing research on what they were interest and based on the work I’d done before and I stayed there for seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And one day they asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">There was a vacancy, a temporary vacancy at the office of Naval Research in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And somebody that has your background and only for a month or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Would you like to do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Managing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I never managed anything except myself and doing my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">But I said well I'll take it and see what, I wasn’t losing my position at NRL. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">So they give me a whole program with money to go and the first thing I do, I interviewed all these people who had already programs from this and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">And I had to cut immediately a group at <span class="BUILDING">Catholic U.</span> That was, but what I found about myself, I found that I never thought of myself capable to do managerial work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">But I learned and I became a manager as well, even though I continued to be my interest and I never stopped learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">So I was there for the rest of my profession with them until 2007. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">So that was, after 32 years of work for the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 So in the meantime, that program that I started there that I was given at ONR but I mentioned the fact that I didn’t know that Raytheon paid my salary because they got it from ONR. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">I never knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Suddenly I am at ONR and this 1s life, very. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">So one day my program, they decided that they don’t want to continue to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">It was filled with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> and some stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">But they had been doing so long with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , basically since the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">If one goes back, the First World War when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> appeared and they were continuing in that and sometimes they reached a point where nothing new was done really to do better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">So they decided not because I failed or anything like that, that they are not going to put money in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And so what to do with this guy, me, that I am an expert in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">They said well there is here a group that works in logistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Gives money to do science and technology logistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And this right now it’s headed by a captain who is coming, retiring from this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And we need somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Would you like to take it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">Well I'll try. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">So yes, I tried and yeah in the meantime I had been, become also no longer belonging to NRL. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">I was belonging to ONR. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">So I’m entering this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I didn’t know what logistics is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">Only some very primitive idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">I looked in a dictionary and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">And then I looked at what this captain had done and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">He was a very nice man who, but he was not a scientist at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">And what he did for, what he did was ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">But it wasn’t the science in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">So here I was to try to find out exactly what other people have done who were being paid money and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">And the first thing that does, I do, interview these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">I went for instance to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic U</span> where there was a group there working with a program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And it’s not logistics and I said you know I wrote to my supervisors at ONR that this should be cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">It was something a million something for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">And they didn’t quite cut off because Congress intervenes in these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">And the people in Congress have the power and the people upstairs in the ONR, they unfortunately they, instead of saying no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">This is not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do so I didn’t suffer from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">But so ultimately I took over this logistics program and it became indeed science and technology with a lot of people that were doing in <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> and also industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">And maybe in <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">So quite a large I had ultimately something, a program with 35 million dollars per year that had to be, and I will go, travel a lot to see what they are doing and going directly to the people who were working on this and they had to give me a, every time what have they done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">https://collections.ushmm.org August 21, 2011 And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And discussing it and I would say go in a different direction and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And I was - and people were at least those who I didn’t cut off were happy with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">But the, I selected the people who — and I had connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Sometimes I would be asked to come and see what they are doing prior to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And in one case it was something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luis Obispo</span> , that’s in <span class="REGION">California</span> and they have <span class="BUILDING">Cal Poly</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487"><span class="BUILDING">California Polytechnic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">And they said they have a new method of dealing with certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And what they called intelligent agents, artificial intelligence, so called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">And they showed me when I arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">They had three people with computers and the task that they had was to load with equipment a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that 1s, can bring these things to the, of the Navy into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and to resupply and so on with all these things or whatever to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or any, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Now to load something like that, it’s not easy on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is, has all sorts of <span class="INT_SPACE">decks</span> and it has <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Can they do this or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">They have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cranes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">It’s a very complicated story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">And they used to put two people to work for one single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , maybe two weeks or more to decide whether they, how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">So with this intelligent agent, just on a computer having all the data about what loads they have to put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , they could do it in half an hour and they proved it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">And indeed this is one of the most successful things that I, and with not a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">Some other projects cost millions of dollars and didn’t perform as, but this with a quarter of a million dollars they advanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">And nowadays they have a company of about 200 people that work on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">And it’s not only the US Navy and the Marine Corps and the Army but the British are paying to have this program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">And it was really something that, and I also suffered from it in one sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">When you are in the Navy you are any government and so on, you defend yourself from anybody else by saying this is no good for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">We’re going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">You know we don’t want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">And indeed they refused to use something like that and this is a story, a long story in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">But so —
