<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I need you to start off by telling me your name, where you were born, and when you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Adam Beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitokislavski Nicholage</span> (ph), which is <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , before it was, of course, part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And I was born February 25, 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  It’s a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , lying very nicely, geographically, under the Tetra (ph) Mountains. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">In other words, when I was young, for instance, you could go ski, you have a already on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It was a very quiet life. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Not much excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Typical small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And this lasted until about 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Then trouble started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  There was not a big community. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We had about 300 families. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So maybe, total, 1t was 400 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was a community, which I think you can compare here to conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">There were not -- there were maybe only two or three Orthodox people. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">There was the rabbi, the shamis (ph), and the contors (ph), the cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Otherwise, people were . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Most <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were -- good <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were closed, but they made business on the site. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">For instance, you could go Saturday, shopping, but the front, see, was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So you just went through the side door. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, it was really cheating, but that’s how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We had very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> there in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We had, we made our own matzos (ph) during the Passover time, right on the <span class="BUILDING">school place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish grammar school</span> , which I attended from the age of six until I was <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Culturally, we had good cultural programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We had <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , which played. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We had, Sundays, we had outing in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was a large Macarby (ph) group. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The Zionist movement was pretty active there. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So it was a really very nice little community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Did you mix much with the Christian population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes, we did because at that time, I had very good Christian friends, because mostly after I left the <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> , which takes eight years. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So you go from 19 -- I graduated 1940 from <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And there, I met most of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We had very good relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We went together, we had fun together. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And there was no animosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That all ended, of course, when <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became independent and the situation changed around. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But until that time, no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  And your family business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  My father was -- had an <span class="BUILDING">electrical store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He was a master electrician for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He was very well known and he was very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He took care of the <span class="BUILDING">leather factories</span> , took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Always they should be functioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And we weren’t rich people, but we had -- made a nice living. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We also lived in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , actually, it’s two <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we lived in, and next door to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we rented out. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The chief of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zhandamarie</span> (ph) was our tenant there. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Then, a dental technician was a tenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> was right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And my father was pretty entrepreneurish. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">For instance, he built <span class="BUILDING">garages</span> for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to park overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And we also, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there was a , from the cigarette people who sell cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So it was a busy <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And that was where I brought up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I had a older sister, two years older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She was born 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Her name was Gabriella, or Ella, short. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I have four years younger brother, name is Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My sister, of course, died in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And my brother is still living in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicholage</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  One other question about this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You mentioned that there were Zionist Youth movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Were you involved in these political organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  I wasn’t really political, but they sports organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We had outings, we had exercises. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It wasn’t -- for instance, the was on the agenda, but at this time, I was, you know, not really interested in that because we had a pretty good life there and we never dreamed about a time that 1t would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, it was more a cultural and sport organization than political organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Now, prior to 1939, what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Well, we knew enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We had a radio, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The radio at that time was still pretty new, but we had a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I remember very clearly as we were listening -- my mother was still living at that time -- I think it was in April of ‘34 where the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">His name was Schuslig (ph), I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I remember that and we were quite shocked because there was already a from Hitler’s party because he wanted to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and so, it wasn’t good for -- 1t was how they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And the new president . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So, we knew about Crystal Nacht (ph), in 1938, we heard that over the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And it bothered us, but still, nobody comprehend, nobody could foresee that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We were pretty edgy about it, but we still took the attitude, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> 1s a free, beautiful, democratic country and we didn’t worry much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I’m afraid so, in 1939, before Slovakia Republic was born, March 14 in ‘39, my father got papers to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> , to immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was official and he could have given the paper right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But my grandmother was still living , and my mother was already dead, and we didn’t see that we could go away and leave her behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So we figured, we’ll ditch these papers to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I was still in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">As I say, I finished -- the last year the Jews could graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was on June 6, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Of course, I always wanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , but I was cut out. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">No Jew could enter <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, what to do, then? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, I went to work for my father in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I was, it seemed, from 19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Although in 1944, we already went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to escape, but we will come to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And about the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Soon, the Slovak regime started. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">My father had to give up the business and he had to be political party zealot (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="106">An Audian (ph) person, had to take over. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He was the boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He took the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">That was from 19 -- if I remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So my father was employed, I was employed, but we stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We did not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Now, my sister, she was a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She was very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And she worked for a Slovak company at a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">By 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all girls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be taken to a <span class="BUILDING">working place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions, but many of the girls came. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They had about two weeks notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But at that time, you didn’t know yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They came there and stayed overnight in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And the next day, they were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poprat</span> (ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Now, we didn’t know nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We knew nothing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Now, there were some parents who were a little bit smarter than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And when they got the notice, they send their daughters to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She’s married here to an American boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But my father,we tried to talk, I must say, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and which took care of all the Jewish problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And my father went to this -- to help this girl to beg that they shouldn’t take my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But they did not worry about it -- just didn’t want to talk to my father about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we made because they left of March 27, 1942, from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicholage</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And on April the 2nd, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took them from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poprat</span> (ph) to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We never heard of her anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But we stayed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the tragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called economic exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn’t even have to wear the , the Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We didn’t have to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We could travel, but the condition was we needed to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by 6:00 at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We couldn’t go to a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We couldn’t have a watch, we couldn’t have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">If the family had a radio, it was a big punishment for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And actually, we worked, and my father worked, uninterrupted, until the uprising took in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which was August 29, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The uprising took place in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called , which was maybe 50 or 60 kilometers away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There were some politicists, landing down (ph), some from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , some from the brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They picked out a few men and they were coming towards my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and quite a few army people. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there was a <span class="BUILDING">German station</span> of about 10 or 12 men who managed a <span class="BUILDING">telegraph station</span> for . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">This partisan and the army came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that was 1n a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They surprised these men. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They shot them all. . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was the president of -- for their interruptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The front didn’t have any more connections to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Because we knew that if something had happened, that there would be murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the Germans might (ph) kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, we didn’t know, of course, at least, something bad had happened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicholage</span> (ph), my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> lies right on the top of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, about a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He was a communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And he built us a bunker in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , about three kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Please ask me if you have a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Actually, I don’t wan to -- I want to go back a little bit before we talk about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  I’m curious what happened between 1938 and 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That’s a big chunk of time, considering what was happening in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So, what was happening in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, on October 6th, 1938, they took <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and was divided in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , Moravia and <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169"><span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became autonomous. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That means, the president was still the president of both <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , but autonomy , but they still went to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Then, as I say, from October 6th to March 14, 1939, when <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , under the , it will become independent state, that was completely bought from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Moravia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It became Slovenkis Shtat (ph), <span class="REGION">Slovak State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The president of our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> became a Dr. Joseph Tiso, who was a Catholic priest and he, as a minister/president, he had person called Dr. Voitisch Toka (ph), who was a lawyer, but also, they were all Nazis, what we call sympathizers with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And from that moment on, from March 14th, the rules and regulations came out, restricting. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They said you couldn’t be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">You couldn’t have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You couldn’t have watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You had to give up any gold or any jewel you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You’d get a piece of paper that -- to get the things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But you liberty was restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You couldn’t own anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You could [not] have your own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You’re either to work for somebody or you were just out of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That was in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But there was a as I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , until the first deportation took place from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and that was in 1941 for certain people who were claimed to be communists were at night -- police came at night, took these people away, and they were never seen since -- never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">That was in ‘41. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My father -- we still had to at the time, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But because he was an electrician, they needed him, so they let him work. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He was under the control of the men who are in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But we could work. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But every day, some new regulations came that were tougher and tougher and tougher, until the time came when, of course, people started to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Not political, but deported to so-called work. “</span><span class="sentence" id="194">You will go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">You will help the government to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And you’ll be fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And you'll even get -- everything will be fine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Did I say that time when my sister was taken in ‘42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  You said ‘42. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Was there any German presence? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Or everything was controlled by the Slovakian government?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  There was Slovakian government, but there were <span class="BUILDING">German offices</span> in the capital city of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There was a person, a German person called , who was the ambassador there. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And of course, he gave the instructions what should be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But locally, there were some Nazi party Youth organizations, such as Euchre (ph), but officially, everything was controlled by the Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But the hundred or so were German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  So you were never officially occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  No, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> wasn’t occupied, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="209"><span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> wasn’t because they become allies with , and therefore, they became so-called independent, but of course, they had to do as they were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  The other question is, you had a lot of Christian and Catholic friends, I assume, before this took place.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  I was talking about how other people , any my father was still in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  No, I was asking you about the arrests and the beatings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There were some, but really, the bad things started in 1941, and mostly in *42. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That was when the mass deportation took place, and the whole family was just -- they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I remember, for instance, the cousin of the Schuller (ph), the colonel, his five children, I remember like today, they were taking him -- the police escort. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And it was a very sad thing to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And we stayed because we had the exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But all these people were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">All the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were out of the Jewish hens (ph) already at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">As I say, it was all under different management. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And the life became tougher every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There was a rationing of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I know that we didn’t have everything that we wanted, but because my father was so long in business and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , to electrify the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know, to start putting electricity in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So, many times, he brought butter in or some meat or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So, we are not starving really. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But food was very, very hard to get.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Do you remember your family talking about the situation and what you thought was going to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  You talking before my sister went or after? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Before, I say, we didn’t know it was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We knew that if we honestly would go to work, it will be living. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But, as soon as the transport went -- as I say, it was April 2nd, 1942 -- and we knew it was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And we heard a few weeks after that, we knew already there was a liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But what could we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We couldn’t escape at the time, because there was no passport, nothing you could get, no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You were stuck where you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But we tried to prepare for the inevitable, to build something that we could escape, if bad comes, and hopefully, to save our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And I think in 1943, I had a friend whose parents were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so he worked for his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And they had two horses and a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And little by little, the material to build the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> on Sundays, we shipped to the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> where we built the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And somehow, people didn’t notice too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You know, why are they being gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But anyway, it was several times, delivered wood, and it was probably needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And his name, he was a carpenter, built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , which I have said was very wonderfully equipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> -- Oh, I didn’t tell you, we were four families together, four families together, which, of course, put the money together to build this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We were all friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There were two couples -- husband and wife, husband and wife, husband and wife and a son, and my father and my stepmother and my brother and I, because my sister was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So four families. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">This <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , it was pretty comfortably built. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We had, for instance, our own radio so we could communicate with the . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But how we did it, we brought in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and we put a through it, a dynamo on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And running the wheels of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , we created electricity and we were able to listen to BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So we knew what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And it was all lasting very nicely from the day when the partisans came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- like I said, 1t was August 29, 1944 -- until we are liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">How .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I know, you want me to continue with this story now? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Or do you have some other questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Well, I’ve got a lot to cover before we get to liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Please do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  What else did you have in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Supplies? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">For instance, we had -- yeah, we prepared all the supplies in canned food. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Everything was canned. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But we hid (ph) them next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , we built a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground and put it all in. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So we had a supply for several months to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And and we are to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">There was -- in the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , in the little -- not the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> , but there was some . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was in this . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we were able to look down into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So I say, except maybe the linen -- so we brought it out when we escaped -- but the food, everything was prepared for us to go in and start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">That was, again, in ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Meanwhile, deportation took place almost every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">More and more people were removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">For instance, there were two doctors there. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And they needed doctors that were still left (ph) there. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But in ‘44, those families were deported, and of course, never heard of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  There were regular deportations after your sister’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Deportation took place from ‘42 to ‘44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  Was there a pattern? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I mean, who did they take first or...
ANSWER:  First, the people, I think, they didn’t need them so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But the doctors, the electricals left in 1944 because we needed -- there were not enough doctors to go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But then, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> took over and these two families were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Older folks, for instance, who were not working anymore, who were not contributing to the economy, they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And everybody who left never returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Nobody returned from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We had president of the Jewish organization there who was supposed to cooperate with this party, the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Whom to select -- it was very tough thing for a Jewish guy -- he was a lawyer, an attorney -- Dr. Weinmann (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And he had to decide whom he was going to send out. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And you know, that creates very bad blood because Why me? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But that’s how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He survived the war himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And he lived a very quiet life that got . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I want to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We knew that we might have to escape from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were living was maybe 200 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The walls of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were maybe one meter thick from stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The meters (ph) were very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Not only were they small, but they were -- they had little bars in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So you know, if they come in the night to get you, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were closed, the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So, I told my father, ““You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Let’s remove these bars.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We removed the bars so in case, maybe, we could escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We had a big <span class="DLF">back yard</span> there and -- we never had to do it,so, but I said we are prepared for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were -- 1t was harder and harder -- our insecurity was getting bigger and bigger because we didn’t know when the time would come for us, although my father still was the exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But that could have been revoked any minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We are working, and I remember very clearly, I was helping in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , making the electrical work in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And this August 9th, ‘44, I hear machine gun fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And -- because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very quiet until this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">In the meantime -- so we jumped up from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , ‘““What’s happening?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="350">Oh, freedom, freedom! </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The ’s here. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Liberation 1s coming.” </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Well, we were very happy to hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And, as I said before, this killed his 12 German soldiers there and arrested a few of the collaborators, maybe even shot them, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They were in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> (ph), but I’m sure there was some killing going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But we knew this end of it, and, as I say, we said, “Now it’s time to leave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  How much did you know about the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  We knew because, well, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was mostly Protestants, so we were a little bit against the regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And there were some people were coming in with information about going on and maybe even trying to get some people to join the partisans in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> -- because that was our adventure (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We went around <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So they were coming- because at that time they weren’t in uniforms, they were in plain clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And, though we knew what was going on and we knew the time would come that -- we hoped that the revolution would take place in the , because there was a -- the people parachuted (ph) from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and took *s army. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I understand there were even some Americans who were shot down over <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , and they returned. , </span><span class="sentence" id="364">but I was told that. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So, there was accumulation (ph) to get out of there and come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liberlin</span> (ph) <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So we had some information about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And of course, Jews, if there were anybody around, were welcome to join the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Now, my father still has to work, I had to work, so in the , we Stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But the day came, August 29th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  So, did you know there was going to be this uprising?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  No, we didn’t know, but again, it was in August of ‘44. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The German are losing the war . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, we knew something would happen, but we -- this came as a surprise to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We were surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We didn’t know what to -- we knew the end would come, only we didn’t know when. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we tried to prepare ourselves good as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">As I say, we fixed the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> (ph) so we could escape and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But it was a surprise.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  The food, remember, we had our supply there. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But we must co-exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Okay, so, ready?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  So we are in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And you asked me how did you spend the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We had to cut wood to build fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Fire wasn’t very good thing because the fumes from the fire would go straight up to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , you know, and anybody who was down in the valley could see there was some fire there, so there must be some people there, but there was no way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But it was still August, it was still summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But then, September, October, November, December. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Big snow fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And we had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Otherwise we would from freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The food we still had there, but we also got an enemy <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We got lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Washing -- there was no water there close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">There was no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> no this -- so we had to -- I don’t remember how we got them out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I do remember washing was not a strongest point at that time, but we tried to keep it neat as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But we got lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I remember, every morning, there was a time when we had to get our lice and clean ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it became tougher and tougher because sickness could -- we could have caught sickness from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">But we made it through. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But on -- about two months after we were there, I don’t remember the time any more, we got a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Four -- I think there were four or six peasants found our <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Came there, said, “You are Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">You hiding here?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="505">Yes, we are.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="506">You have to share your <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> with us.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Now, we were 14 or 16 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Not much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but of course, we had to share with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And with them was captain- I remember his name, Captain Novotney (ph) was his name in Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Everybody nice, decent human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And we had accommodation. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We had to -- instead of one person on the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , we slept two people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and we made room for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Both these guys had weapons, automatic weapons, and they were going around, they were going out, seeing <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and so on (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And my father was very good man, but very naive man. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He was so grateful to these people that he told this Captain Novotney (ph), “Captain, if you should need any food, we have some food here. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Please help yourself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And he showed them where the food was. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So, one day, when we went out to get our food and we see the <span class="DLF">hole</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Everything was taken out, no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">it really was a shock, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">There is no food now. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And it was getting winter, October, November. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">What to do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So, we went down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">As I said, we were three young men there. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And we -- one time, I went some of the others so we trade so nobody come . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and told them we had money and we need some food, give us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And we pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And the people said to me, “We will not give you food, but if the Germans find out that we gave food, then they will kill us, because you’re enemy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So I said, “Look, either they will kill you or we will kill you (we had a gun with us).” </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And they gave us the food, we paid them, and we brought it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But winter was rougher and rougher because smoke in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And I remember one day, my friend went up, and coming back, he almost froze to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He told me a story that he had some pins and he pricked himself in the fingers so he shouldn’t fall asleep, on the way up. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He just died about two years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">He lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">He was doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But it was tougher and tougher. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But on December 15th, which was a full winter -- oh, I must say this. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We had, as I said, we were on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and we had a beautiful view of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And we had a very good German-size binoculars. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So I and he, we are watching guns and what is happening (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="543">One day, we notice big mass, big mass of moving people there -- this is we are looking down in the valley. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Now, we couldn’t see whether they’re partisans, whether they’re Russians, whether they’re Germans, was it the , we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">But we saw we had to make some change in our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Not far -- maybe 50 yards or less from our <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> -- was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So, early in the morning, before the sun came out -- early, early in the morning -- we took our rug and, you know, with us, and went to sleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> because we were afraid that these men might be the enemies and they would find the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And we did this probably a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I don’t remember how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But it paid off on December 15th. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">In the meantime, we are in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> (ph) is empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But the partisans stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Because they had weapons, they stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So we hear big fire -- machine gun fire -- which lasted maybe half an hour or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">and of course, being snow, we could see the foot marks of the soldiers of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The foot marks had come there and that’s the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But they never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">At night, we came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was completely burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And two bodies lying there, from the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">It surprised us that the partisans were the two that were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  The ones you knew -- the partisans you knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The partisans which were with us, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But two were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I remember, they had the nice boots were taken off. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I remember one guy had a finger cut off because he had some, probably some ring or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And was completely burned with gasoline down. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So we had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We had only the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  Before you continue, I have a couple of questions about your life in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Did you stay in during the daytime? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Or could you come up for <span class="DLF">air</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We could come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Because remember, it was all <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">All <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> around, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Very high up. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So we could go up, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  And you had your own weapons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  We had one Luger. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">One Luger we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And I don’t know whether we had six- we are not big shooters, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But I bought the Luger in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> from somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I thought if they would catch me, I would shoot myself because I didn’t want to fall in German hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was for committing suicide because I didn’t want to go . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And that’s all we had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  How often did somebody have to go down and buy food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Oh, I figured, at least once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Maybe twice a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But dare I say, we did it as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Because it was risky, because if the German patrol catches us, of course, it’s they find us, we are partisans, the partisans are shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">There’s no prisoners taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So, that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But after we had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , and only the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , we around our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we discovered another <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , which we didn’t know before, not too far from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">A Jewish family, whom we knew were from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">The name was Mr. Stein (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I remember very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So we came there and we told them we had just been out. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Would you please help us . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I’Il never forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">This old man came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And he brought out an empty sardine can. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And he told my father, how’s this, “See this sardine can? </span><span class="sentence" id="607">How many sardines can you put in it? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There is only so much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for sardines.” </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But he wanted to say there’s no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for -- because he didn’t let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We left and started to build a new <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We had no material to do it, but we cut down <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and made a very, very primitive <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We used some rugs on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And we lived there from December 15th -- not December 15th, because we , but from end of December to April 7th when we were liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Did you have particular responsibilities? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Or did everybody. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  I guess so. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Except -- yeah, to go down to the food, you know, for the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Because, remember, all these people are much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So they stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">There were women who were old and sick and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So, that was our job, the young folks, to go get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And to cut the wood and to make fire and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  So there were women and children with you also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  No small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We were -- I was -- in ‘44, I was 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">My brother was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The other friend of mine, Dr. Brown, he was five years older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The other boy was two years older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So, the youngest would be my brother was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The rest were much older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  But there were women also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Now, I said, my stepmother, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Gordner (ph), Mrs. Pollock (ph), and one bachelor from <span class="REGION">western Slovakia</span> who was in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and he joined our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So there was one single man. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The rest were all husband and wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But there were no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The youngest, as I said, was my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Did the local people you would get the food from, were they at all supportive of the partisans Or...
ANSWER:  No, they were just doing their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You see, , of course, knew that there were Jews up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And they found out, somehow, they disguised as communists, built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And some of them were collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So they told on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Yes, Mr. -- I forgot his name -- he built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for the Jews who are up there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Either the Gestapo or the Slovak Gestapo came out and told him that “Either you will tell us where the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> is or we kill your family.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Of course, family came first. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So this carpenter told them and that’s how 600 German Ukrainian (ph) marched down in the valley to get our <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="650">That’s how they found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So there was a connection there. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But after a while, the men who told on us, they were caught and brought up to the area of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And that’s where we see, because the view, see what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And they had to dig their own <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They took them there and shot them to death, the partisans, as a punishment for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  During this time, did you, or your brother or your friends. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Oh, one -- may I say this to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="658">When we were surprised, it was the machine gun fire that blows. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">My brother was out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">He panicked and ran out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">When we were counting heads, , my brother was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">he wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So we figured, either he was gone by the Germans, was taken prisoner and shipped, or he was shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">It took me until our liberation on April 7th, when we were liberated from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , to find out that he had run down, came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , knocked on a <span class="DLF">door</span> , a young lady let him in -- and I don’t know whether he knew her before or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I can’t tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I forgot to ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">but anyway, he was liberated right after December 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was liberated some time in January or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And that’s his wife today. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But we do know that he survived until the end of the war, until we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So, he escaped, so we were one man less.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  During this time, did you think about joining the partisan movement? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Was that an option?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">ANSWER:  It was part of the option, but somehow, it would have required to leave the family, to leave my father and go away, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And somehow, I wasn’t ready for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So maybe I wasn’t ready to be partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We had a , because they came to our . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But I’m sure that if I would have said, “I want to join you,” they would have taken me in, maybe given me some uniform or something, but -- neither one of us -- neither of our boys in our group (ph) joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We had to take the favorite (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  These were Slovakian partisans, Soviet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  One might have been Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">But the captain, as I said, most likely a Slovak, and the other two men were Slovak, too, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">One might have been Russian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  And they were okay about Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  I mean, they didn’t murder us. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I don’t think there was a big love. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">As I say, they took our food away. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">But they let us live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  So, your new <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> that you built, you were in that one for several months again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Maybe from January ‘til April. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Maybe three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It looked like three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">It was very, very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was cold because we had just -- just wood and wood, you know, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> -- just enough so that it didn’t rain, or rather, it didn’t snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Very, very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Because we had no tools, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And of course, no help. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But we survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  What was the life like there? </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Was it different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  No, but we were much more -- in other words, much more scared, much more frustrated, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And we didn’t know what the end was, and what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">As I say, the food was harder to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">We had to go down, you know, put a gun on people to get the food, and it was much more rough after this burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Because up until that time, people pretty good to , but then it was much rougher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  Did you pay for the food or you just threatened people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">We paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We paid with Slov money (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="713">No, we paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We didn’t want to -- but they people were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">They would have given us the food, but they said, “If you will support the Jews or other partisans, you are an enemy and you will be shot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So, I can understand their feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So we told them, “Look, is 1t you or me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And we gave us, and we paid them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Was there much -- either German or the Linka (ph) guard -- presence in this <span class="REGION">area</span> at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Could you hear a war going on other than that one time you saw . .. ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">No, because maybe we were about 2,000 meters up high, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Yeah, we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> overhead flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Of course, we heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We didn’t hear any artillery fire because it was far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The only information that we had from the radio, and it said that the was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  So you were still getting news from the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Until the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was burned out, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  And then you didn’t have anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  But, then, of course, I say the partisans had some use until they would stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And maybe, I don’t know, there were some people went by there or something, where those people were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But we are much less informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  And then, in the last few months, did you have any contact with partisan people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  After we found the two dead men there and after we build new <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , I don’t think there was anymore partisans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I just didn’t see any. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We were complete on our . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Mine was my brother, of course, until he ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But completing that part of the stories, one morning, on April 7th, 1945, six uniformed men -- either Czechoslovak uniform or Russian uniform, I don’t remember quite -- came to us and said, “We were sent by our captain to count any people who are hiding here and to bring them across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Already, the liberation took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And I am here to get you there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Now, we are very happy, but also very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Are they real ones? </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Or are they Germans to get us and kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So we had a little consultation with us. “</span><span class="sentence" id="747">What should we do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="748">If we don’t go with them and we stay there, we probably die from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">If we go, we take a chance, but maybe they are real. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And of course, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They took us all -- I don’t know how long -- we walked there and crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which was already liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It was April 7th. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And I know, a day or so after that, I went to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Everybody went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Tried to find my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But where the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, there was no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground, because our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was located near a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vah</span> , and the front moved several times between the Germans and Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was the target. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">It was completely gone and there was no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , just a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So, there was nowhere to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">We rented in the <span class="BUILDING">city place</span> -- we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">But already, by May 15th, I was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> (ph) and enrolled in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We were very impatient to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  When you went back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , were there people you knew there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Do you mean the Jewish people or Slovak people? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Jewish people, I don’t know that there were many left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">But the Slovak people, neighbors and so on, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  They welcomed you back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  I don’t think -- I don’t remember anymore, but I don’t think 1t was a big welcome, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">There was no band there. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Certain things -- for instance, we had -- before we ran away, we give to this Christian family to put away for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I think when my father went to get it, it wasn’t there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So, they were surprised. ““</span><span class="sentence" id="777">You mean, you are still alive?” </span><span class="sentence" id="778">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It wasn’t a big welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But who cared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  And your father, did he stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  He stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , went back to business. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Continued and worked, I think -- he died in 1976 as an 86-and-a-half years old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> after the war until -- maybe until he was 75 years old or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  He stayed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  He stayed there, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And he died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicholage</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And I say, I left and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> (ph), stayed there until ‘48, and then came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">We'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">How much more time do we have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  I think we probably could change it. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
ANSWER:  So as I said, April 7th was our V-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">We came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We didn’t know what happened to my brother, but very soon we find out that he was liberated about in January, about three months ahead of us, by running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">We had to rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was down. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And I didn’t stay very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I just look at my medicalations (ph) book, and I thing on May 15th already, I medicalated (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> which was the capital city where the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And the only time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> between ‘45 and ‘48 was on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Christmas vacation and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And by 1946, some friend told me in the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> that there 1s a young lady who needs for the anatomical courses, she needs some skeletons to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And he knew that I had some skeletons -- I don’t know where I got them particularly, but 1t was -- I had some skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And one day, in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there, somebody knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the young lady says, “I am Susan Ei1soffer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And I was told by your friend that you” -- -- “that I could borrow some bones for my study. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Would you be kind enough to lend them to me?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="806">Well, sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I liked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I lent her the bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And the day after or so, she brought me a wonderful goose liver as a present -- as a present for lending her the bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And I don’t know why, but I must have like her, so I took her out and we were dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And to make it short, of course, it’s my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And her father was a clinician in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topochurney</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So he wanted to know who is the guy who, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So, one day, he comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to see who this young man is. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">So, she introduced me to him and, evidently, must have liked me or something because he didn’t object too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But that was also in ‘46. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And I stayed there until July or June of ‘48 because I got my -- oh, I must say this -- she got papers, she had interrupted her schooling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , and she got papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in January of ‘45 -- January of “48. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And I think she came on January Ist, “48, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New

I didn’t no understand one word he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">So, he knew right away that my English was not too good. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He says, “Come back in a

id="828">And I left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> on July 27th, “48, and I came by small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It was

id="830">I was sick 10 days on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> because I was sea sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And I remember, I lived only on the military ration of the big

class="sentence" id="834">So, it was hard to recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

ANSWER:  September 19th, 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , after the war, what was it like to be a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  Not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I’Il tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Because in 1946 started the trials of the president of the republic, Dr. Tiso (ph), the vice president of the , and all the collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Small number of trials (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I remember one morning, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , and I see on <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and <span class="DLF">doors</span> , big placards which says, “Death to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Because it didn’t kill all the Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="848">That was the sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So, not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So, you know, that was the other thing -- that they should get death, but because it didn’t kill all the Jews at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So, the population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> was not very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And also, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I couldn’t say that I noticed anything as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">But the population wasn’t ready because -- see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and there were quite a lot of German population there. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And of course, many Germans were caught, they’re executed, so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So, the atmosphere wasn’t very good there. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But you asked me how it was, so, it wasn’t very pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  Were your friends in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> all Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  Not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But quite a few of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And one’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , New York, now. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">One is living in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And the other friends, who were Slovaks, who went with me -- who graduated with me from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- one of them was an instructor in anatomy in a <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And he was very nice, very good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And when my future wife had to take a test, I told him, “Would you be kind enough just to help her out?” </span><span class="sentence" id="865">He said, “Of course I will.” </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I remember, he called her up or she called him, and said, “Adam is my boyfriend.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="867">Well, sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Very, very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So, I had friends who were already doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And see, because there was five years difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And they were either in practice or they were assistant of Medical Supervisor (ph), and he was an instructor in anatomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">So, it was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  Did you start practicing your religion again? </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Was it important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  Very good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I was told, by my future wife, that you cannot be very liberal anymore with our religion (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="877">But, my parents would never stand for it because they were Orthodox. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="878">And you have to, if you want to continue contact with me, you’ll have to become religious.” </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So, it was news to me because -- I’m not saying that her father wasn’t that religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">He was a very decent, honest man about . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">But I said, “Okay, I will.” </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And I had to go to several ceremonies and I had to go to Mikwa (ph) -- you know what that is? </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And of course, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and prayed and, uh, I became a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  The whole time you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , you probably didn’t think of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">No, survival only. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">We might have prayed <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">But...
QUESTION:  Was there any special strength that you think helped you all survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  Just to live and survive at all, as I say. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">It was enough (ph) to just live from day to day because it was very rough, and we knew what was going on down in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so on, so we just tried to make it from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And I think the will to live was strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">As I say, everybody from our <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">They are all dead now except -- actually the one young man who -- he is still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">The other friend of mine, Dr. Braun (ph), he died two years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And of course, our parents are all gone now. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So we are the last of the Mahicans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  Did you think, when you were hiding out, that you would make it through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  I know that sort of -- I hoped. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">But there was no guarantee. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I was living from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">But we hoped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  When you think about this time, 50 years ago, are there certain images that come to your mind or certain reflections that you’ve had over the years about this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  Really, what we can say is that we had a second lease on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Because, as I say, my sister died at the age of 23. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">From the girls, 300 girls left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Not one came alive back. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">The only ones who saved themselves, who didn’t go, you know, who were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">But it was a miracle, really, that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And as I say, 1f my sister wouldn’t have been the victim, we would have been an intact family. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I'll say, for example (ph) -- my wife, she probably told you that her mother and father both were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and they all came alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">But a different war. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They were taken in ‘44. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">See, two years later than my sister went. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So, . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But that was a miracle, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Very few families left in tact. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So all I say, see, we are -- well, we’re alive and grateful that we could establish ourselves again. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And we just hope that it never happens again. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That’s all I can say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  Do you feel that -- other than the obvious, your sister -- that this period was a great loss of anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  It was -- of course, it was a terrible loss of life, loss of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I mean, five years was lost for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And the things that we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I mean, it’s -- I’m not blaming American people who cannot understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">May I just say an example? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Somebody who we knew very well came one day to my wife and asked her -- and she knew she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- “Did you have enough protein to eat?” </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Now, this was an American person born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">An unliberation (ph) camp, where people went to be gassed and killed, you ask the question, “Did you have enough protein?” </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So, when that happened to my wife, she was shocked from it, you know, but -- let me tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">People cannot -- and I don’t blame them -- they cannot understand what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And children are torn apart and thrown against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">But human life had no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I mean, you killed a person like nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">to come back to some type of normality, that was a big, big step. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Life was worthless there, absolutely worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">You have seen murder, killing, I mean -- I was okay, but still, I see what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">So, it is very, very hard to comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But American people, thank God, don’t know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And I really don’t blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">But it was a very foolish question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">QUESTION:  Was it a big adjustment when you arrived here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">ANSWER:  Well, it was, it was, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">First of all, we were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Suddenly, you got here to the land of plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">It was hard, you know, to see all the things when you -- I remember, for instance, when we were still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And when you got a banana. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I remember, very clearly, a banana was cut in four parts, so each one, a member of the family could get something, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Or an orange. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Oranges are a thing to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Those were the real thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">During the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Before the war, 1t was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">So, I’d just been to the plentifulness of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And the free life. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">It was something which was hard to comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">For instance, I remember -- I always carry some documentation with me because I never knew when the police would stop me and ask me for documentation, because it was normal there. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">The people are lucky, why do you have that? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Maybe I would be stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">You know, in the beginning it was (ph). “</span><span class="sentence" id="962">Who will examine you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">So, they are different worlds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  Were these some of your first impressions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  First impressions, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Or for instance, when I first bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> here, it was in 1940, I bought an air conditioned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">By that I mean it had a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so it was good air conditioning, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="969">But it was all I could afford. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And we were used to brake the motor (ph), because it was the only way to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So, I remember very clearly, I wonder sometimes how I did it -- I never stopped for a stoplight. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Until one day I was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And I learned a lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Because that was the way to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">You had to break the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">You know, you had to fight for your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And so, the first year or so -- it’s scares me -- I went through the <span class="DLF">stoplight</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I looked in the mirror for any cop there, and if no, I went through. . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">So, I wanted to tell you that you had to readjust. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">So, it was different, different life. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And I was very surprised for this one thing -- I don’t know if this is interesting to you or not -- I was stopped here by an American friend, and someone would speak to me, “How are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="983">He’d always ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">SO I would say, “Oh, I will tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Please sit down with me and I will tell you everything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="986">You know, I thought that he really wanted to know how I am and I wanted to tell him my story. “</span><span class="sentence" id="987">Oh, dear, I’m -- good-bye, see you next time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Then I learned that “How are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="989">doesn’t mean nothing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Things like that, you know, they are strange to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So, now I know what “How are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="992">means. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">It was an adjustment. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And of course, I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during the day, I worked at night at the <span class="BUILDING">doctor’s hospital</span> as an orderly, . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">| worked at <span class="BUILDING">Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And there was pathologist there who was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And I told him that I was a medical student there and so on, and that I could use the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">So he found me a job to do autopsies, when somebody dies, autopsies need to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So he called me and I remember, I got $10 per call, whether I was called or not, $10. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">That was big money that time in ‘49. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So I was doing this for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And the last autopsy which I had to do, I was called, I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> lies a man whom I have seen two days alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He was a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">We were working in as houseparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And this man was the father of a girl that was a housemother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">He died suddenly, so his autopsy -- and I was the guy who would do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I was so freaked out that I took out this, what’s called the cholera, the wrong way so it was shown (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And they had to fix him and it was very . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">So things like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">One way to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I worked as an electrician during a year or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And mostly, after , 1 got rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And then I realized that...
