<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My real name is Morris Engelson, but that's an anglicized version of...in Polish it would be Mosha Englczyn, but any how, what's in a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My Hebrew name is Moshay, and I come from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , which is in the news now in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podgrada</span> in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Now, the name would be Pograder which would be the Lithuanian version of the Polish name for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  When were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was born in mid 1935, so I am just about 55 years old now, and that made me 6 years old in 1941 when the Germans came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Before the Germans came in, what do you remember of your very early years and I guess when the Russians came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I remember a pretty happy sort of carefree childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Although it turned out we were not rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">In fact we were quite poor for a certain reason that happened earlier which is germane to this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> is a beautiful scenic area. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">People came there for vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It's well known as a vacation spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I remember people talking about...oh, this famous person came and that person came and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So it's a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> on two rivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">With <span class="DLF">bridges</span> across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as we call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Roughly half Jewish and half mostly Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Maybe 5,000 people altogether, about 2,000 Jews in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And there was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish area</span> was sort of by itself but not any significant amount of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The Jews and the Poles got along reasonably well together which is unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I remember it as a happy <span class="NPIP">place</span> and an enjoyable <span class="NPIP">place</span> with games and playing and running by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and all kinds of adventures or misadventures. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Stuff like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">What did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father was in business similar to his father in dealing with buying grain from farmers and reselling it, so he was a grain merchant he would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">A total of seven brothers and sisters that he had, so I am dealing here on his side an extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They were all married. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He was one of the youngest in the family so we're dealing with an extended family about 50 odd people. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And my mother's family, she had a sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That's all because they were quasi-recent immigrants having been displaced during World War I and they came to this <span class="REGION">area</span> after that but my father's family had lived there for many, many years so my mother's family was more scattered and the rest of her family was in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In fact, one sister was in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soly</span> , which helped us out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But my father's family comes from an old Misnagid [non-chassidik] family . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The whole <span class="REGION">area</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Misnagid</span> because of the Wilner Gaon and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And my grandfather, Alav haShalom [may he rest in peace] was a very very staunch you might say stern type individual, but a very honorable person who believed in doing everything by the book if I can say it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Well known individual who paid for it in a certain way, but the Nazis when they came in they usually picked on somebody who they considered the leader of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I don't know why they picked on my grandfather because he was not the Rav [rabbi] but we have eye witness accounts that he was the one picked on. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They ripped his beard out, and they blinded him before they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So that was not a good way to end your life at the age of 81. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But he also was a grain merchant, but when I knew him he was very, very, very poor because something happened 20 years prior to that that made him poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And that's an important story I have to tell you because that's what saved our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It happened that he used to buy and sell grain from the local farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Local farmers in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They were sharecroppers because the primary ownership of land in this feudal society in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was from the large landowners a form of nobility. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">However, there was one farmer who for some strange means had acquired his own <span class="REGION">land</span> and acquired a little bit of a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he was considered rich by those standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my grandfather used to do a lot of business with this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">One day it seems 15 years before the war or something like that, Grandfather decided that the way to...to really go was to become not only a merchant but a miller because the real money to be made was in turning the grain into flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There were three <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , all water-operated <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">When one <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> became available, he decide to buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And so he bought this <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> and he spent everything he had...everything he could borrow to buy this <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> and he had no money to buy grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So he went to this particular farmer with whom he had dealt many times before and he made an agreement that he would buy the grain on credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I don't know what the deal was, how much extra he paid him, but the farmer trusted him and he sold him the grain on credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And the grain came in and it was put into the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was all filled up and then according to the story apparently it was arson but nobody proved anything because the idea was the other two millers were jealous because they were afraid that he would become too much of a competitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> caught fire and it was on the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And it was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and people could have put it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They started to put it out, but my grandfather came out and he said, "There is nobody in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">No lives are involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">You will not put it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It's Sabbath.” </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And he forbade them to put out this fire and the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and all the grain with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So he was bankrupt and he owed this farmer for all the grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Now the farmer could have probably taken him to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> or something, but I don't know what he could have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">In any event, my grandfather then walked about 20 miles or whatever the distance was to the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> , the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he told the farmer that he would pay him back everything no matter how long it took. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And it took something like 10, 15 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Everything he had, everything he could get, and there were some...there was a son in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who sent money <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Everything the family went to this farmer to pay back for the grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That's why the family was poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Now, the critical issue is that after the Germans came in we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Many Jews escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Those who had no money they usually did not survive because they couldn't pay anybody and people were not that altruistic because it was very, very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Those who had money they did not survive either because eventually they came in contact with somebody who killed them for their money because it was very easy to kill a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There were no penalties whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So anybody who wanted to kill a Jew and take their money, they just did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Nobody would kill us for our money. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But what we had is the honor of the family that spent 15 years paying off. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And this farmer's sons hid my father with the belief that if we survived they would be rewarded, and they knew that he meant it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So through this <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> that burned down and my grandfather spending 15 years paying this farmer and his sons knowing that my father was the son of this man, they were willing to take the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So in a way he was paid for letting this thing burn down because he said you do not do work on Sabbath. (</span><span class="sentence" id="87">Long Pause) There's a reason for everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Let us go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Let us go back to when the Russians came '39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Tell us what you remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I remember that extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I was standing by the <span class="DLF">road</span> and my mother was screaming at me to come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and it was the most fascinating sight that I had ever seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This is a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span> , not even paved, you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">When we say <span class="DLF">roads</span> it was the place where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> went, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I had never seen more than one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> per month before and here were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored carriers</span> , whatever, going for hours and hours on end. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Non-stop! </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I just couldn't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I didn't understand where these things came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was like magic, and it was just so fascinating to stand by the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the dust and these things rumbling and making noises and so forth and finally she came and snatched me away because she thought it was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It wasn't dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">These people weren't doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And they seemed to be going on for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Iam sure it was hours, but it seemed as if there were millions and millions of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> just non-stop continually going and going and going and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And the Russians came and took over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and russified it or whatever the right word is. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They changed the administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">A lot of people were rounded up and sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , the so-called wealthy and the landowners and the anti-communists and whoever they feared. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Our life didn't change much because we were not rich to start with, as I told you the story and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but that didn't make us into landowners. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And life went on as before, and no significant changes of any kind except there was a lot of tension, the fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You could sense different behaviors. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Of course, there were stories which I didn't understand at the time about the atrocities in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in the German occupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There were refugees that were coming through telling horrifying stories that nobody believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I mean it couldn't possibly be that bad, you know, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But on the whole, it continued to be peaceful and most of what I remember of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...in fact, about what it looked like and...and it's beauty and so forth I think is more from that time than before '39 because I was very young, only 4 years old in '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It's hard to remember precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There is one memory that I am certain 1s before '39 because I fell into something, almost got killed, but anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was a childhood accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But otherwise, the Russians didn't do anything to us, but there were various changes in the atmosphere which was more of World War II than the Russians themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then in 1941 in June very suddenly...it happened very quickly as I assume it happened everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The Russians were there one day, and then they weren't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There was hardly any fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was no front. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">All of a sudden there were no Russians and there were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And we knew they were there because right out from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">military base barracks</span> where military were stationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Right out side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> , about couple of kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">A very, very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> the soldiers used to come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">All of a sudden before that there were Poles that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The Russians came in and the Russians took over that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> made it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And all of a sudden, the Russians weren't there and the Germans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So the Russians interlude was sort of a beginning and an end and sort of no middle to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Tell me about the Germans and what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">How did life change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Well, the Germans came and the Jews were...two basic orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">One was a location order and since the Jews tended to live in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> anyhow there wasn't really that much relocation. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Some people had to move and it got a little bit more crowded, but it didn't crowd us all that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They just adjusted the boundaries of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> because the Jews and the Poles did not intermingle all that much even though it was a combined Jewish-Polish town. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The Jews lived in one <span class="REGION">area</span> , and the Poles lived in another <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And so the few Jews who lived outside of this <span class="REGION">area</span> were forced to come in and find <span class="NPIP">places</span> with friends, relatives, whoever it may be, and it got a little bit more crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The other thing, of course, was that there were curfews and you could not leave this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There were <span class="DLF">boundaries</span> but no real <span class="DLF">fences</span> , no <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> , no real guards to speak of. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">You had to be there, and the penalty was harsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">If you were found <span class="NPIP">outside</span> it, you were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And they did do a lot of shooting of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Terror killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They came in and just took little groups here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And no rhyme or reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Presumably they were leaders or whatever, but many people that were killed, they were not leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I don't understand what the rationale was. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Maybe just to generate enough fear that people would obey orders and not argue about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And people had to wear the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You had to wear two stars, one front and one back. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And if you were caught without a star, the penalty was death. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So you had to wear the star to be identified fully as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And you were not permitted to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Life became more difficult in terms of food and making a living because all the relationships and business things, and whatever the case may be...those could not exist anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So people lived off of accumulations and savings or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But that was of no consequence because we're dealing with only 3 months and I am sure the people had enough capital or whatever to live for 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So there was no real transition to Jew(ish) ghetto situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  How did you feel the change as a kid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  The change was a different life style. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It's a tension, and it was very clear...the kids understood it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There were no arguments about the curfews and not being able to go to certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> that you used to go and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was very clear that this was serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">This was real. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">This wasn't just parental whim...no, you can't go here because whatever the case may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">This was very clear that the kids almost...it's almost like a law of nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">At that age you understand that you don't jump off the <span class="DLF">roof</span> because it 1s dangerous and it isn't just that your parent is afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You really don't jump off the <span class="DLF">roof</span> because you may get hurt and you're old enough and smart enough to know that you don't want that to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was almost that kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was not an issue of somebody telling you. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You knew you did not do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It was almost as if it was a physical law. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You didn't cross this <span class="DLF">barrier</span> because something horrible would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">sothere was no issue about dis...disobeying anybody or...or trying some childish tricks about these rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You stayed where you were supposed to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">You wore the yellow star like you were supposed to wear the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was a very strange experience in terms of growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">There was a jump of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I would think that normally a child would not acquire that kind of mental outlook till later. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And in my case I was 6, and it happened very fast and I don't know exactly how the adjustment was made, but I do recall that all of a sudden I had this outlook that this is normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">This is how you were supposed to do and it wasn't a matter of somebody telling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So there was some kind of mental adjustment. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I had no idea how it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  You were an observant family I understand it...Jewishly observant family. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Did that...did the curfew affect that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Our family, my grandfather was extremely Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Mine was not that much in those <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> 1t would be considered. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I mean it depends. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Everything 1s relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But it wasn't any big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">All the Jews were observant in one form or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Those who were not observant were what you call it extremely traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> (???) </span><span class="sentence" id="207">and the other <span class="REGION">areas</span> we were hardly Yiddishist related. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We had many people there in our own family too that were involved with Yiddishkeit not Jewish historical, but the Yiddish language and the Yiddish literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="209"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , as you know, was the place of the YIVO, the Jewish what do you call it? "</span><span class="sentence" id="210">Wissenschaft" <span class="BUILDING">Jewish knowledge institute</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Knowledge Institute</span> or whatever the proper translation would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And it was a modern type movement dealing with current events as opposed to historical Judaism, and dealing with the Yiddish language as a force and the Yiddish literature as a force. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And many of these people were totally unobservant in the sense of holding to the Mitzvoth because they believed (not) in the Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But that was a way of life and it would be very fine for these people not to follow through. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So they were traditional in the sense of this is how a Jew lived whereas those who were observant were this is how a Jew lived and this is how a Jew must live. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It's a very fine distinction in that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Today, of course, the distinctions are much greater. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So I don't think there was any impact in terms of the behavior of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because that's how Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And all of the stuff was internal anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">It isn't as if you went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to a Polish friend and had a ham sandwich. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So if you are talking about kosher food it was all Jewishly created in any event and the fact that the Germans were around us that didn't change anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">At least I don't recall it. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I mean this is a very poor perspective from a 6 year old, but that's how I recall it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  How did things change? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">When did things change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  Well, things changed a couple of months after the Germans came really....significantly in that <span class="NPIP">places</span> started disappearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I don't know how else to say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">All of a sudden a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There were no Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It as if it was pulled off the map and shipped off to Mars or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Somebody would come in, "I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">All the rest are gone.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="232">Where are they gone?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="233">They're dead.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="234">Why are the dead?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="235">I don't know.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="236">Did you see it?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="237">I didn't see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Nobody knows anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Can't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They're dead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And it was clear that they're dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The question is why? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And there were all kinds of theories. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">People ascribed some very specific rationale, logical reasons for why the Germans were doing these things as opposed to just pure spite or hatred or some manifestation of a pagan religion that made it necessary to kill all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So people tried to ascribe logistical war reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They wiped out this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because they needed for a <span class="BUILDING">military base</span> and they weren't going to bother to relocate the Jews because they don't care about Jews anyhow so they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But they don't need our <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a <span class="BUILDING">military base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And later when we, my mother and father, escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Belarussia</span> (<span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> ), the whole rationale was they're killing all the Jews here but the <span class="COUNTRY">Belarussia</span> is alright because that's across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So <span class="NPIP">places</span> started to disappear and because the they were places of like kind in terms of <span class="DLF">borders</span> and location and other things, there was a general feeling we too were on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The question is what do you do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And we couldn't do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So there's a great deal of uncertainty, a great deal of fear, a great deal of wondering what would happen and that people were very jittery. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It's like living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> after the earthquake recently and wondering what...when the aftershocks going to hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Do you run? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Do you stay? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Do you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Are the <span class="DLF">walls</span> going to crumble down? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Except you couldn't go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">People wonder why they didn't escape or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">There was absolutely no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Those people who escaped...there were some who managed to escape as the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They escaped in front of the Germans and they went into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They escaped with the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Those people really had some <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">They had the foresight and they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But anybody who stayed, the front was so far behind us or rather front of us, which ever way and the Germans were practically in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So the change was more of the same kind in terms of a general feeling of I won't say fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Uncertainty and dread. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I think dread is a better word than fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Not knowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  What happened is that in September of 1941 on the Friday before Sabbath Shuva which was on the 20th of September German groups...soldiers came and organized various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local men villages</span> , primarily civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">There may have been some Poles in those groups but I am not aware of any, and it is my understanding it was one of the Einsatzgruppen came to finish off <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">There were about 2,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> and surrounding vicinity there were little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farm communities</span> or whatever and just lived all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It happened that one of the local police functionaries was friendly with a certain Jews because of some prior favors that they had done to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And he knew that these people came in and they were organizing various things. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He didn't know precisely why but it was quite obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And so he came to his Jewish friend and he said, "Something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">You have hours before the <span class="NPIP">place</span> will be surrounded and nobody will be able to get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="284">This man sent out the alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Most people (a) didn't believe it and (b) had no idea what to do anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They weren't going to leave children. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They weren't going to leave parents, and they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and they said, "If I am going to die, I might as well die right here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Many people such as my father believed it more or less but they wouldn't go because in prior times there had been false alarms and there was a great deal of looting and people were afraid of losing their few possessions because really you were not going to have a chance to work or do anything useful to gain more possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But there was some work I should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The Germans put the Jews to work in slave labor and it was very hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">In fact, my father worked at slave labor and he fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It wasn't deliberate. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He fell off a...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffolding</span> or something and he broke two of his ribs. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So at that time he had taped up ribs and...and that was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But anyhow my father decided to send my mother, brother and myself out. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We...we agreed where they would go and he said he knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">He was a strong man. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He was a very, very strong physically, my father in spite of his broken rib, and he felt confident that he could get out no matter what they did because he knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> extremely well and he would be able to hide and sneak through. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">He said, "I am going to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and if there's looting I'll stop them. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">If something is happening I'll come meet you there next day.” </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So we packed up some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was the Sabbath food, some chicken I remember and a few other things in a bundle, dressed up as peasant woman and took off the yellow stars and we walked right out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Nobody stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">There were no guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There was no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The problem was we had to walk right by the <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And that scared us because we were sure that these people would do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They had nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Those were ordinary soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The Einsatzgruppen group were the SS, and the soldiers were soldiers, and we were just peasants walking by. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We walked right by the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a couple of miles out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there's a little <span class="DLF">road</span> to the side where all these Germans...the soldiers were staying, and we saw them coming and going and we just kept walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And it was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And so we kept walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And we had a couple of hours walk to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a certain <span class="DLF">farm</span> of a woman that our family knew, had done some business with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Fine lady presumably. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">She was a widow, had a teenage son. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I would guess 15, 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And we came there and she was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and mother told her something is happening and we need to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The woman was very fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">She didn't want us there, but she couldn't turn us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So she said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I won't let you in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I am afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Go stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="326">There was a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and there was hay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and we crawled up 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> and the hay, and the <span class="DLF">barn walls</span> were not wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were kind of straw and we could see through the chinks in the matted straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And during the night we started hearing shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So it was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It was clear that something was really going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was a lot of shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And father was supposed to come during the night if something would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And so we were sure that he couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That was the end of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">In the morning we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But before we could do something, a Lithuanian local auxiliary came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he wanted to know if any Jews were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and the woman, "I haven't...I don't know anything about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">No Jews in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">If you want, come in and look.” </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And he says, "There are other areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">What about your <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Jews have sneaked into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="343">She said, "Silly, what would Jews be doing ina <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="344">Listen, you have been working very hard," she says, "it's been a horrible day. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They're working all night chasing these terrible Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Come in and have something to eat and you can chase some more Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He says, "Okay," so they went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And she gave him breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He was eating breakfast and her teenage son came into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we heard this and this was very close so we could hear them talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We saw him with a gun, a bolt action rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">You had to pull the bolt, an old type rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And the son came in and he said, "I'm going to get you across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Come quickly.” </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Now <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Popberezha</span> is on two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">One 1s a major <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> called the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lyna</span> [this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> 1s far west from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> ! ] </span><span class="sentence" id="358">which you will find in all the big maps I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">It was the Lyna that was going over there or it could have been the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I can't swear to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Anyhow he came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and he was rowing us across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and we were about two-thirds across and for whatever reason this person saw us through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">He got up, he stretched or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He saw us through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He dropped his where the .......?? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">1s gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He ran out and he pointed his gun at this young man and he started shouting for him to come back or he would kill him but this fellow continued to row for about another half a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We were close. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">If we were not close, I don't know what would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">He continued to row. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We got to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We jumped out and then this fellow, I think, he shot one shot or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">This guy turned around and he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He got him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and rowed him across so the Lithuanian rode across and he was about 5, 7 minutes behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we were near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">There were some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And he starting shooting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And we just kept going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and he was right behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And I don't know how he missed us, but he missed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Now we couldn't go very fast because we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and there were branches ripping us up, you know, and I was not running too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I'm a little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And we were not woodsmen people. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">We're towns people. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So we kept running 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and he was behind us shooting at us all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And this woman was sure that we were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I mean it's impossible that we would escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And she never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He just went wherever he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And she never saw us. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">She didn't go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to look obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Anyhow, he didn't kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So we were in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we're running 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and finally, we knew we lost him. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">But we're lost in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We don't know where to go or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Just lost in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And we're wondering around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in circles or whatever...just going in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Finally, we're up on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> or something and in the distance we saw the spire of a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Very tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So we needed a direction to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Now a very strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Many of the priests in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were illiterate priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They were peasants themselves, and they were very anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I have to say this. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">They were illiterate and they believed the Jews killed God. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">The Jews crucified Jesus and they preached it. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And not as badly in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> but they preached it and there were plenty of anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The towns people themselves were not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Strange deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">This <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that we saw, this priest was not only not anti- Semitic, he was, you might call, philo-semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He really believed that the Jews were a good people and that it was his christian duty to protect the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He was very friendly with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And we got to this <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and a woman came out...the housekeeper or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">She says, "I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The priest is not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">They're killing the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he went to see if he could help. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But he left word if any Jew managed to come to this <span class="REGION">area</span> I am to do certain things for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Here is some food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And what she gave us is milk, something to drink. "</span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I will lead you to where you can escape.” </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And she sent us off to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">She told us where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And we had not known about this thing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was an old smuggling network. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The <span class="REGION">area</span> is on the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and it changed hands many times and the people in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , they didn't feel the <span class="DLF">border</span> was real. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I mean sometimes it's <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , sometimes <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Who cares about customs. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">There was a whole bunch of people, a gang or whatever you call it who were smugglers. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And the commodities they used to smuggle was saccharin (it) was a very big commodity because it's small, and it was very precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Substitute for sugar because sugar was very hard to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">That was their big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Saccharin and cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Anyhow, so she got in touch with this gang of smugglers. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Now they were not altruistic and they were not anti-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They enjoyed crossing <span class="DLF">borders</span> and taking risks if they got paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So whatever money Mother had she paid up, and we went from hand to hand to hand to hand...a 2 week walk at night and they would hand us off to the next station of this smuggling network. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And on the <span class="DLF">road</span> on the way lots of other Jews got involved in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Pretty soon there was anything...20, 30 people, sometimes coming and going, each one looking to get to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And we were looking to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colsol</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> where mother had a sister and she figured that's where she could go where she knew somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So he told them where she wanted to go and they said, "Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We'll move you on this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And this people were going to move you that way.” </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Was a whole network of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And along the way, each one you gave a little bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">As long as your money held out you were alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They gave you food. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">During the day we were hiding and at night we were walking through <span class="DLF">fields</span> , across <span class="DLF">barbed wire fences</span> and all kinds of stuff and it was pitch dark and they knew all the <span class="DLF">holes</span> and all the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and they would say, "Stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">There's going to be a big <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Hold hands cause you'll fall down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And we would hold on and walk across. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And we walked for 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And pretty soon we were on the outskirts of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they said, "That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Our job stops here. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You're on your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Do whatever you like.” </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And all of a sudden they weren't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And so we were down to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">My mother had two wedding rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">She had her own wedding ring and her father's wedding ring with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Everything else was given away to these people, and we had to get to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And it was far away and also dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And there was a farmer with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> driving by so she came to him and she asked him if he would drive us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if he knew where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He said, "Sure.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="465">Would you drive us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He said, "Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Pay me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So she decided she would pay him with her own wedding ring and hold father's because this was a memento. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">She was sure father was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So she gave him her wedding ring and he drove us right to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we came right in and I have to say this because there's feeling I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I am unhappy with certain historians and other analysts who claim that the leaders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and the Jewish police were all nasty and hoodlums. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Clearly, there were some nasty people there as anybody who rises to power and in the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> there were some tyrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But all my experiences this one and others as I'll tell you, these people did an exemplary, selfless job in extremely different circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They didn't know us. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They didn't owe us. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They created papers for us as if we were members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so we could live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They shared their food. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They shared what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We became members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We were fellow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There're other incidences when we escaped from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where we had to go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">The same deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">In my experience, this is a baseless (ALL SOUND STOPS AT

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We are back on camera, and they are bringing you to where your father is. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Can you describe that reunion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  That was an emotional reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I really don't remember that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">There was a lot of hugging and holding and Father hadn't slept for 2 days, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He was just walking around, pacing. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He was a nervous wreck, but as soon as we saw him, he said, "I knew everything would be alright because I saw the snow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="501">When he saw the snow he knew everything was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And then 2 months later, this was in December 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Before you go to 2 months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Where were you brought? </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Where was your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  My father was in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where these people lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And arrangements were made that we would stay there too but we would hide in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We did not stay there very, very long it turned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Somebody saw us or maybe they didn't see us, but there was a suspicion that somebody saw us, and there was a great fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But I think somebody did see us because there was some searches going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">There was a great fear that we were betrayed and we would be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So we had to escape and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to go, and this was not 2 months later but about 4 months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It was already toward the spring, toward the middle March, April of 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  And you had been hiding how in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  It was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we kinda lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">That was not a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">There was another <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> later which was a major thing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">This <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was transitory and I really don't have any great recollection because we moved around. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Sometimes we're here, sometimes we're there. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Sometimes we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">There was a little, kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> except that it was very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brick oven</span> that also was used to heating the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very hot, but when we were presumably betrayed by someone we had to escape from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And we went into the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">A lot of it was potato country, and when they harvested potatoes they stored them in <span class="DLF">holes</span> under ground in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They would dig a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> and that's where the potatoes were kept because of cold air and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Well, we hid in a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> underneath the potatoes in the big <span class="DLF">hole</span> , which was a very unpleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> because there were all kinds of worms and things and animals in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">It was just a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground and potato bugs and whatever, and it just drove my mother crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">She couldn't stand those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">She was almost willing to go and be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My father just about forcible put her in there because, you know, she's not afraid of the Nazis, but she's afraid of the potato bugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Obviously she went down eventually, but it was not a pleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It's damp and eventually I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I became very sick and some kind of bronchitis and they thought I would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My father went out in the middle of the night and he went to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> someplace...don't know where...and he stole. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I mean that's the only words for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">In a sense he stole. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He milked a cow, and he brought back warm milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">The only warm thing we could have because there was no fire or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And that's what I drank. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I don't know if the milk helped, but I became better. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So he stole some milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Not a terrible crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Anyhow, after that we could not stay there anymore, and then we moved to another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Whereas the first family had some relationship and they had some reasons and they had reason to believe that we would really reward because my father promised and the grandfather and all that stuff, which was all true. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">This other family, we kinda knew them, but there was no special relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And this other family was very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They had a lot of kids and they were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">They didn't have enough to feed themselves and they took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">No ulterior motives. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">They didn't ask for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And these are the people that we really gave everything we could, even more than the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">There were two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Andamazing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Sienkowitz and Bagdanowski. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I should say the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">These are important people. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Sienkowitz and Bagdanowsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And we hid in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> in a hidden <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> and that was what I remember the most of the hiding and it was, for a young kid I didn't realize it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">As an adult I really don't understand how I survived it and be half-way normal because it was tremendous sense of deprivation. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Everything was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There was some light from the chinks in the slates in the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> but it was dark during the day and during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And there were always people, strangers whoever, so you could not speak out loud. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So for over a year I was in the dark and I didn't speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And that's a crazy environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I can't say I'm completely normal, but I don't think I'm very peculiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And so maybe that's a good sign that people can overcome all kinds of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And we stayed there for just about a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Now I need to back track one thing what kept us going and what kept these people going which is what happened about 2 months or so after we reunited with Father. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">You will recall from history that when (General von) Paulus was surrounded and captured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> in January of 1943, I believe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I would have to look it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And the Russians made a big propaganda deal out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They dropped leaflets all over...not <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> maybe, but all over the prior <span class="REGION">Russian territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Not only telling about it, but with complete pictures so it could not argued that it's a fake. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Or from Paulus and his bedraggled remnants of army or whatever thousand they captured...I don't know...300,000 that were there showing that they really were captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">This was a tremendous celebration for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Father was convinced everybody that we talked to...all the...all the Gentiles were convinced that there's no question who would win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It was no longer a issue of which <span class="NPIP">side</span> am I going to be on because I don't want to be in trouble with the victors. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The victors were going to be the Allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The Germans were going to lose the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">There was just no doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">No matter what the Germans said, no matter what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Once when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paulus</span> was destroyed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , as far as we're concerned, it is a matter of how long will it take. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Made life a lot easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">All the uncertainty was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">All we had to do is stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And these people were certain if we were alive, eventually we would be liberated and if we could do something for them because they were poor people...these last ones and the previously ones were not so poor, but even so we would keep our word. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So it changed everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">That victory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> had special meaning for me because it really was the turning point as most historians say of the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but also the turning point of belief in what was coming among those people who had to survive...the remaining Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Tell me a little more about life in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and how the farmer helped you particularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I don't know how the deal came about, but my parents...my father used to go out and work sometime on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">If somebody saw him, they could get away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">His hair had turned completely grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I mean completely grey, prematurely grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And so rather than use his regular name which himself was not necessarily a Jewish name his name was Wolf and in Polish it's Ulfa so it could be maybe not a Jew, but it's sort of Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So they started calling him Stary. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Stary in Polish means the old one because of his grey hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And so he acquired the nickname Stary and on that basis nobody would know who he 1s. "</span><span class="sentence" id="607">Who's that?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="608">Oh, that's Stary. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">He came to help us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And so he could go out during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">My mother could go out sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Her Polish was quite decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">My brother's Polish was not wonderful, but not too bad because he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> prior. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I didn't know any Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I could only speak Yiddish, and I never went to <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">My Polish was just words that I picked up, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">You live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you pick up Polish, but it's not as if you live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , where you live here you speak English from birth no matter what your ethnic heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Over there if you were Jewish you spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Who spoke Polish unless you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or when you got older. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So my Polish was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I don't know any Polish to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I know Russian because this...this one and a half years was really Russian...<span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> so I... have some decent knowledge of Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">My Polish is just useless. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">My brother's Polish was not that terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">He could go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I could not go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">If somebody saw me and said something to me, as soon as I opened my mouth there was no question I was not a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I couldn't pretend to be Lithuanian either because the accent was just wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So they made a deal or agreed or whatever, one night the farmer came and he said, "We're going for a walk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So wonderful. "</span><span class="sentence" id="634">Come on, We're going for a walk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And so we went for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Just him and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Still who knows who would see us? </span><span class="sentence" id="640">It was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">There were rewards for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The reward was salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I hadn't seen that written any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The reward was salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I don't remember how many kilograms of salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Salt was a great commodity. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Very hard to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Very precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">People wanted salt more than sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And if you handed in some Jews you got salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">People looked for the reward and there were nasty people who would do it for the reward. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They would do it out of spite. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">While we were hiding there, there was a family hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and one day, some so-called great patriotic partisans who were fighting for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ...Poles in this case...found them. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">They took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They shot them...saw it through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And they came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They asked for some to drink, and they told the farmer, "Go bury those people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And they were sitting there talking in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> talking next door to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where we were and then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And they were Poles, Army Krajowa from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">There were other partisans, mostly Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">One day my father was caught by them and he was sure they were going to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And then they looked him over and they decided he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">He stumbled on their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And then they looked him over and they decided that he's a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And they said to him, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">We're not going to hurt you. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">We're just like you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="670">In Russian "Vi tozje takoje" which means we are also like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Those are the exact words they said because Father repeated it, so I'm repeating you what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And in fact they said, "Do you have any food?" </span><span class="sentence" id="673">He says "No.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="674">Come here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They had shot an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Maybe...probably a farmer's animal, and they gave him a quarter of beef to take with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They sent him on his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Didn't hurt him. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They were prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The Russian prisoners of war were treated abominantly by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">There was a prisoner of war camp not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soly</span> and obviously the Jews were all eventually, they say eliminated and Soly was sent off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponari</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated, but none of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">The living conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were a hundred times better than the prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The Jews used to give them food if they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They were starved to death and worked to death, those Russian prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And when they escaped their hatred for the Germans was something unimaginable. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">They would very glad die as long as they could take some with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And many of them became very sympathetic to the Jews, especially if they came from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like the one I described where the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews, the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And this particular band helped my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We learned later that this band was wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They got into a fire fight with somebody, and they were all killed apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But anyhow, so we lived in this little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and about once a week or so, from then on, we was determined we go for a walk for a hour or so at night always, look at the stars, talk a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Was not a very imaginative conversation because my Polish was not that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They were wonderful people because one day there was a big scare that somebody had seen us there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So we decided...they decided...this was a tremendous chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I can't understand how these people decided to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">It was totally insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We would just integrate with the family because if they found us in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> clearly we were strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And I remember he put me in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And it was at night because somebody was supposed to come searching and we crawled into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> together as if we were, you know, living together because I was young enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">She was a little kid, but I think younger than me, so it was considered alright under those conditions because the family was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And the only thing I remember is the giant bed bugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They were about this big. (</span><span class="sentence" id="707">Laughter) Huge red things, which we did not have in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">In that respect the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was better. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We had rats or mice and they were not good things to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They were scary at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But these bed bugs bit and they were big. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They made hugh holes in your flesh, and, of course, there were lice and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We suffered from dysentery and lice and all kinds of intestinal parasites. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And there was no...very, very bad sanitary conditions and the local people suffered from the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It wasn't just us. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It was local conditions were that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So that made a big difference, the...the walks at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And then eventually the Russian Army came in and we moved right with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We didn't stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Nobody stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Anybody who survived didn't stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We ended up as refugees just moving from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  Can you back up one second because we had been left with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  Bed bugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  Bed bugs and you were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Tell me about the German search.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It was either a false alarm or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Apparently, there was a search in surrounding <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">They didn't come to us, but there was a search in the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> and some Jews were actually taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But in this case we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We couldn't go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and they decided if there's going to be a search, we would all commingle and the German's wouldn't know who is who. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And so we just totally became one big family...was a big family lots of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">They had...I don't know...seems like a thousand kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I think was something like 8 or 9 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Was a very poor family. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Staunch Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And they saved us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  What did you do in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> all these days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Father educated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He taught me reading, writing, mathematics...whatever he could oral. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">That's how I got my primary education. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">It wasn't a bad education because I did manage to survive <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">university</span> here and so forth and apparently it worked, but it was a very difficult time because we couldn't speak very loudly and not all that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Most of the time I either slept or looked out through the little <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That's it you could not do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">You couldn't move, no exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You just sitting waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">The mind turned off. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I don't have that many memories of what I did cause I didn't do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Think now. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The Russians have come. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Can you describe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="756">What do you mean when...that the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  All of a sudden somebody...I don't know who, said, "It's all over.” </span><span class="sentence" id="759">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">It's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">There was no fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There was no shooting again. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Just like the first time, the Germans left and the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Before the Russians left, the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">They just...the Germans ran off, and the Russians rolled right through. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">A lot of turmoil. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Nobody knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Nobody cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We liberated a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Gave it to one family, with all the possessions we could gave it to the other family. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Everything we could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">It's a <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And we just followed the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">We kept moving and they were moving more fast than we were and pretty soon we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And then we just ended up in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and then we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> and then it's no big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Just four years of waiting for a visa from my father's brother to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because we were displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">02:21:00 And once we got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> we really could do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Then we continued correspondence with these families and we shipped them money and packages as much as we could because we were also poor just starting with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But to them it was a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And then suddenly these people disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">We don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I think some bad things probably happened because these people were very individualistic and did not take too well to authority so I don't know what happened, especially the...the so-called rich farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I don't know if they did something to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">This is still during the late...late days of Stalin, and some crazy things happened during that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  Both families just disappeared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  All of a sudden they...within one year they both disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">They didn't answer any of the letters or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Couldn't track them down in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">But anyway that's the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  Tell me if you would again. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">You were a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">You were very young and
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  What it was like for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> was a carefree time for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  By the way, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Do you know’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  First we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and then we moved out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on the airlift in 1948 so that was my first airplane ride in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And then we ended up in, I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Yes...1n a camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaubersee</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="804">in a location. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">There were several camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">There were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">There were decent <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I think the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were good so it was the same as any other child. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">You had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and you lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">My parents did some minor work. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">The thing was boredom for the parents because you really were not permitted to have real work. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Some amount to just survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Filling out millions of papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Great introduction to bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But for the kids it was quite good because there was a great deal of freedom from.pressures from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">There were schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">A great deal of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">The teachers were enormously dedicated because this was the first chance to maybe raise a survived generation so there was a lot of dedication and input more so than a normal situation might call for. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Children were precious so you could get away with all kinds of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And it was not a bad time from a child's point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Of course, it was not the greatest from other aspects in terms of a settled life and knowing what's going to happen to you and having a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that's your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It really wasn't our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We were not citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We weren't going to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We weren't going to settle in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">It was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transient camp</span> and you couldn't call it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but in terms of living conditions and friends and so forth I feel 1t was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The adults were very nice to the kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">QUESTION:  How did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">What were the circumstances? </span><span class="sentence" id="830">How did you manage to actually come here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Well, eventually a visa came because, as I say, my father had a brother here and he vouched for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">He signed us up so we came under the displacedpersons act. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I think it was the second one President Truman signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I am not sure which one, but we did not come as pure refuges in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">We came as sponsored refugees because there was a relative who sponsored us, who vouched we would not become wards of the state and so and so forth so there was a quota...the displaced persons quota permitted us to come sooner maybe than 50 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I don't know how long the quota would have lasted, but we came as part of a normal quota of sponsored people. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And so we went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">First big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">First <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , then first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Terribly seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I still get seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="843"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Airplanes</span> are fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="844"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ships</span> are not good for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We came <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , (Chuckle) and that in itself is an interesting story because I did not speak any English. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And I was old enough to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Well, there're no tricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">No "Kunsten" as we say in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">You supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So we signed up and I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Don't speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Well, that's no matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And you know what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Maybe with an accent, but I think I speak a reasonable English. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So I came here and I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And as far as I'm concerned, I'm an American because that's where my real primary education came from...my real education...the only real schooling that I have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Other schooling was all in bits and pieces and in very peculiar circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about that first year for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">It must have been..
ANSWER:  In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  Not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  Well, it was not easy, but I'll tell you I was very naive. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Of course, I was not used to any big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or anything of that nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION:  What <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Where are we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">ANSWER:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">We're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in New <span class="BUILDING">Utrecht high school</span> if you wish to know the exact <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And the people were nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">The teachers were understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">At least I thought so. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">If I wanted to be cynical I would say they were uncaring because they didn't care what happened to me and they let me do whatever I did and they passed me maybe when they shouldn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They just passed me along. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">All I can say, they were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">They understood my circumstances or they didn't make it hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I don't know which. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I had a better background in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> than the kids that came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Mathematics, history, other <span class="REGION">areas</span> , the home education, and the education in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Was a very high level education. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I had only one problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I couldn't speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So I had terrible trouble in English, English language and other areas that require good facilitive language. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">History, English history, social studies where you have to understand what the teacher says. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">The other disciplines were no big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Mathematics is mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Two plus two is four. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">The symbols are symbols, and I knew all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I was ahead of my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">In the other <span class="REGION">areas</span> I did not do well to start with, but I think the teachers really were understanding rather than careless. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They gave me barely passing grades at first, and that was because my content was good, but the execution was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And it's amazing how well you can learn a language if you live among the people and you speak it and you interact. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I am not a great linguist. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">My brother is the linguist. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He speaks a half a dozen languages quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I know other languages, but only because I lived and...and used them, but in terms of learning languages directly from books, it's very hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But it's not that difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">By the time I was a junior I was a pretty decent student. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And so I made friends, peculiar friends who were willing to be friends with this strange kid like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But as you interact and you learn the language, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">The big problem was I had to learn some new tricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">My lunch money was taken away from me and a few other little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Nothing personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">It was normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">That's how it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Then I learned how to protect myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But initially, I think a lot of the special ed classesand so forth, today may be doing it all wrong, from my own experience...and there's too much recognition of the differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I think what's needed is to mainstream the kid to have normal intelligence and to be patient with their difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Give them a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">But let them learn in whatever magical way people absorb knowledge just like little children do unless they're old...too old to do that, but I found at 14 it still worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Probably wouldn't work if I was 24 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So I was just mainstreamed, left to my own devices, and just by interaction I learned that |-1-0- nis lion and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> (is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ) and after a few corrections you remember and that's all there is to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Something that has nothing to do with my own experiences but there is very little talk of German re-unification right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I don't think I have a unique perspective but I will tell you something that bothered me greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And it is not that unification 1s coming, because it has to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I would prefer that it be 20 years from now. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">The generation that did these things is not around any more, and I have nothing against the new generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I don't believe in collective guilt or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">It bothers me greatly that the loss of memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">That's why I am so happy to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I was watching a news cast two months ago, 6 weeks ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">There was this huge rally. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Chancellor Kohl was giving a rally. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Lots of signs. "</span><span class="sentence" id="928">Ein Deutschland, ein Volk", various things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Legitimate. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And people were saying how horrible it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">That they couldn't be unified and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">It happened the same day our local newspaper had pictures of the same rally. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And the same day I was reading Newsweek. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">It had pictures of the same exact rally. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Very strange coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I was a little upset about this big rally because I am worried about reunification. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">That's immaterial. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Then I saw the name of where this rally is held, and I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And the thing that I still think about is that I have not heard a single commentary or mention of it any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">The rally was held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Now people should know that Toppensohn who built the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> and if you don't know the history actually, that Toppensohn had the same problem that all contractors have with Government, that it didn't work right in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And they protect themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">You know it's only a science. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">You don't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">You know the mechanics of hugh piles of human flesh and the convection currents. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">But you know you run some experiments and we promise you, we will fix it, and production will be pretty close to 10,000 a day, and you know great German engineering, they fixed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And when the Hungarians were brought in, and they had this big emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">They were able to run production at 20,000 a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Why 1s it that nobody would say, you know we are having this great rally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , and we will reunify because things are different now. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And we know that we will not permit another Toppensohn to come into this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">That would be a great rally.. Not a single commentary that I have seen in all the news media mentioned the existence of Toppenson but the revisionist historians say those were <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> they were baking bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">That bothers me greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It really upsets me. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So even though I was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I cannot have any recollection of it, when I saw those pictures all of a sudden all the banners and everything changed and it wasn't people, it was just <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Because it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And I have no idea if Toppensohn or his son or his son's son are around any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I really don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">That has nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But there is a saying about knowing some relationships and somehow, those have disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I don't understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Surely people want a little bit more history than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I am not a great historians. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toppensohn</span> , that is my comment.</span></p>
