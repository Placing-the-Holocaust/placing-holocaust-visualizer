<p>ANSWER:  Well, he told me that after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He certainly didn’t tell me during the war, when I was growing up, when I was 10 years old, 15 years old, because it was too dangerous to know that you had a Jewish ancestor. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Because according to the German law, my father was considered Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I wasn’t, but — the third generation, so that was kept a secret until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My mother, of course, told me her story, there was no problem there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  How did he survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="589">How was it that he was not executed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Oh, he was given an order by Starzynski to continue taking care of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He was elected by the underground Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">The Polish government was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , but Polish underground — underground was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and th-they made my father the successor to Starzynski. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But the Germans, who needed to have the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> operating well, and they didn’t have the manpower, because most of them were on — in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And they needed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to be running properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So they — th-they made my father the mayor.</span><span class="sentence" id="596">September 25, 2014 Burgermeister was his title. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So he was the president of — on the — from the Polish government’s side in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and the underground government, but as far as the Germans were concerned, he was the Burgermeister. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So some of the pole — citizens, of course, who had — who were not invol — who didn’t know about the underground, thought that my father was a collaborator. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And that the whole <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> was a collaborator. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Then there were tens of thousands of individuals — it’s a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , million and a half —1n order to operate, that was a very big bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And in order to run properly; the electricity, the transportation, the b — the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , the whole system. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So th — and the fortunate thing for my father, and I think this is why he was able to survive, although he was arrested three, four times by the Gestapo, because they have — they suspected that he was a member of the underground, and that he was anti-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">But they — there was one individual, called Ludwig Leist, who was with Hitler in the first World War, in the Bavarian regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He was a regular soldier like Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But they got to know each other, and in — who in 1934 or °35, joined the Nazi party and joined the Brownshirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And sp — went up very quickly, although he didn’t have any — much education, if any, became a general in the essda — Sturmabteilung, SA. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And he was trained to be the supervisor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">His first job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was to create the Jewish ghetto, before heSeptember 25, 2014 became the so-called governor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> , before heSeptember 25, 2014 became the so-called governor of the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And he worked with — what’s his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I keep on forgetting, sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Th-The head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Czerniakow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  Adam Czerniakow was a good friend of my father’s before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Adam Czerniakow was the se — in the Polish senate, and he was also a member of the city board, so my father knew him very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">But before my father met Leist, Czerniakow worked with him for about nine months. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And he was — everybody — the Germans were already furious with Leist, because Leist treated Czerniakow well. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He gave him a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> and a driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And he let him travel all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and treated him like a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And of course, the Germans were absolutely livid, because he wasn’t carrying out Hitler’s policy towards Poles and towards Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But eight months later, he was appointed the boss of ma — of the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So- called stadtprasident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, stadtprasident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  So if he were — he became the city president, and my father was the mayor be- below him, and the whole — a-above each of the city departments, there was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And some of them were — most of them were pretty horrible Nazis, butSeptember 25, 2014 since he had contacts with Hitler himself, he was able to overcome and save a lot of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as long as he was — before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became taken over completely by the SS, which was in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">From there on they — they closed up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and neither Leist nor my father could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But f-for the — the first year, the city hall was able to take care of everybody in — 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , inside and outside of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> was able to take care of everybody in — 1n Warsaw, inside and outside of the wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  So that meant that your father di — reported directly to Leist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  My father reported directly to Leist, but my father reported directly to the prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So he had a — this horrible jewel — job — pole — publicly, he was reporting to a German, but on a daily basis, he was surrounded by three military — Polish underground military intelligence agents, and was in c — daily contact with the civilian and military underground facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So if he was able to gather intelligence, and pass it on, being an — himself an intelligence officer from the Soviet war, he knew how to do it, and he was able to maneuver it, and fortunately, a-as — as I said, Leist was the one who saved many lives, including my father’s and my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">He got me out of the — from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">He got my father out of the Gestapo three times.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  No, I never met him, I never met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">After the war, he, together with other Nazis, were before the Polish courts, denazification courts, and the surviving members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> <span class="BUILDING">Polish courts</span> , <span class="BUILDING">denazification courts</span> , and the surviving members of the ghetto, and of my father’s administration defended Leist, and the other Nazis were hanged, but Leist was declared a Nazi, but not a criminal, and he got a few years sentence, which he spent in <span class="BUILDING">Polish jail</span> after the war, for belonging to a criminal organization, the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He wrote his memoirs, and my father wrote his memoirs, and Czesrniakéw wrote his memoirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So I’ve got all of these, and I’ve translated them into English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So, it sounds that — from your telling, that he was li — not brutal, in a very brutal position. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Is that —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  He was an end — it wa — he was referred to by the leaders of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> as the prisoner of the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Because he was a — he was a martyr, because he — he had to save as many lives as possible, and provide as decent living conditions for — while — Czerniakéw would come almost every week, to see my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He was allowed to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and report to my father, and to Leist. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And my father, at first, was very suspicious of Leist, because he was a Nazi, and all Nazis were horrible, inhuman, and yet, this guy went — after Czerniakow left, and was described the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he turned to my father, he said, poor people — about the Jew — Polish Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And my father was taken aback. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And there were aSeptember 25, 2014 number of things that he did during the five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">He knew about the underground army, he knew about the underground state, and he did not report it to the pole — to the German authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And the German authorities were suspicious of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">In 1943 — for — no, ’44, after the attempt on Hitler’s life, Fisher, who was Leist’s supervisor, was told to form a list of a hundred Nazis who was not loyal to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And he called Leist and told him — gave him the job to do it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to find hundred Germans — and there were tens of thousands of Germans living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at the time, military and civilian, to form that list. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And Leist said, well, I’m sorry, but I don’t know anybody who is disloyal. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And Fisher said, why don’t you start with your own name? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So — and during the trial, after the war, Fisher tried to pretend, to save his life, that he was — allowed Leist to be the good guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Like — which was not — which was a lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  Amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  So that was —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I mean, but I also think — I mean, then Leist, your father, and all those people were living on a razor’s edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  They were — well, Leist wa-was too. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">He was more afraid — Leist was more afraid of Gestapo than he was afraid of us, the underground army. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And — and — and — and one — he used to go hunting outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> with Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And in 1943, theSeptember 25, 2014 Polish underground courts passed a sentence on Fisher for the — death, for the murder of the ghetto population, and the Polish population outside of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> <span class="BUILDING">Polish underground courts</span> passed a sentence on Fisher for the — death, for the murder of the ghetto population, and the Polish population outside of the wall. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I was in the — at that time, in the unit, the commander unit, which executed the sentences of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , of the <span class="BUILDING">underground courts</span> , on Nazi criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And the sentence was passed upon Ludwig Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Well, they were coming back and wi — we put up machine guns along the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> were passing, we shot Fisher’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And unfortunately, these two guys changed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and Leist was the — in the Fisher’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and Leist just hit the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , he called my father downstairs and he said, look how I’ve been — for — for all the good things which I have done for the pole — Warsaw population, and they are trying to kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Why don’t you get in touch with the underground and tell them that I am a Polish friend, a friend of Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">He said — my father said, of course, I will do it tomorrow — right away, if I knew how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I— I have no contact with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But of course, he did contact the liaison officers, and they notified my father next day, to tell him that the order was on Fisher, and not for him, and for — never change the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But it —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  And my father was being arrested at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So he was worried that during the searches of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I would get him into trouble, or he would get me into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So he got in touch with my pre-war scoutmaster, by the name of Ludwig Burger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He was also of Jewish background. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I think he was a Protestant, but he was Ludwig Burger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And I lived with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I wanted to join the underground army when I was 12, so Ludwig came to my father for permission, because I was only 12 years old, and my father said, of course, y-you c — you can — you can join the army, so I was sworn into the Polish army at the age of 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  And I lived with Ludwig, which was only about three blocks away, so from to time I would drop in on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but basically I was — there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and Ludwig trained me as a soldier, and I was — Ludwig formed the first unit of the Polish underground army out of the boy scouts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Most of them were older than I, I was the youngest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And at first I was just the runner, I was running around with secret contacts, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and t-to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But later September 25, 2014 on I became a f — at the age of 13, a year later, I became a regular soldier, and I was trained in arms, and we had maneuvers outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and were trained as a regul — in order to prepare us for to — to fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  So, did you fa — was your father — did you tell him before you went away, that you and your friend were collecting these unexploded bombs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  Oh, he knew — he heard about it, because my f— my friend lost his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I wasn’t there, but he was supposed to wait for me, but he got some nit — nitrogly-glycerin, and it exploded and the whole <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> went up, and he lost a whole leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So my father knew that I was — they were also trying out making bombs, and — and — and trying them out in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> , and so we — he was a-afraid that I was going to get killed, and he had no time for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He was — he worked day and night at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Just drop in for food once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And so he didn’t have — th-there was no man to take care of the little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And he felt that Ludwig Burger(ph) would be an excellent person to take hold of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  And did your mother have anything to say about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  My mother didn’t know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">My mother was very upset after the war, when the book came out, that he didn’t — she didn’t know anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  She didn’t know anything about the powder, or the — or the —September 25, 2014</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Well, I don’t know if sh — I don’t think she knew anything — she knew very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">She certainly didn’t know that Ludwig Burger would sign me up as a soldier in the underground army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  But she knew he took you.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  And —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  But he was a boy scout master, and also, together with Ludwig, there were two young women, Steffan(ph) Solla(ph), and Alexandra(ph) Solla(ph) — Solkul(ph), who were the daughters of a doctor who take care of my mother’s father when he was sick —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Oh wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  —1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Dr. Solkul(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So she knew them, and she kn — everybody knew Ludwig Burger from before the war, because he was an actor, he was a very active youth leader in the — in the boy scout movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And wer —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And you said — and you said he was Jewish?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  And how is it that they wouldn’t have been in the ghetto?September 25, 2014</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, because they were — they were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">They were hiding, so my father really handed me over to a Jewish family, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Only, as I said, the religion had no part in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">They were extremely patriotic, integrated Polish intellectuals, and th- they — they — they lived — there was a little boy, Marek(ph), who is still alive, the son of Ludwig’s, I saw him a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  And we keep in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And when I was being arrested by the Gestapo, he was playing over the secret <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had our — our arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And he was only eight years old at time. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I was 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  But here is my question. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It’s — it’s not so much that they were integrated, and not — religion didn’t play a part, it is, wouldn’t they have been known by the Gestapo, and why — how is it that they could hide in plain sight in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">W-Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  Well, it all — it — well, in almost every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> that I know of, I mean, certainly every other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , had a Jewish family being hidden, including our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">My mother hid about nine members of the Jewish family between our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we — also, later on we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And she took care of — saved a number of members of — Jews who were, you know, integrated, and were not Polish speaking, and who could survive in — in — in hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And it’s a kind of crass way to put it, but did Ludwig look Jewish?September 25, 2014</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Just look at the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So that meant that if he was walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , he could have been picked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">ANSWER:  Well, he was six feet four inches tall, he was extremely handsome, and he was very self-confident. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">He was a real leader, and bordering on the arrogant, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So I don’t think they — they would dared him, until they found out that they were looking for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And this is how I got caught, and — and — and Steffa(ph) were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  We’ll come to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  They were looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They were looking for Ludwig.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But it’s — it’s just so surprising to me, to hear of somebody who would be living openly, more or less, on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , and he could — considered himself a Protestant, but that doesn’t matter if the Germans are in control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But th-th — he was a great hero in this part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He was known by everybody and loved by everybody, and nobody cared what he was — he had the Jewish grandfather, or — or the grandmother, or whatever it was, you know, it was unimportant. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">He was —September 25, 2014</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  So, you know, it — I don’t know what kind of papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Maybe he had the Volksdeutsche papers, for all I know.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  So what was the test?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  — he was — he was head of the c — the — the company of 150 soldiers, and at that time the captain had the right of making a decision like that, legally, of a — a suspect was enough to be killed, because he could bring so many deaths, if he was caught by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  So tell me, what was the test that you had — that you had for him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Well, I talked him into going to the police and — and — and — and selling Ludwig for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And it wasn’t very difficult, he already had that idea, so I went and reported to Ludwig, and Ludwig had him shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  But you know, again, that was something that was — I was 12 years old at the time, and I — I —I-—I only found out later that he was killed, and where he was killed, by — by our execution squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And I felt, of course, responsible for it.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Which means you don’t really have a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Your childhood ended then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  Yes, it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Well, everybody had to grow up, but — but basically we were brought up, the Germans made it very clear, that it was question of time, that they were going to kill us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So it wasn’t a question of whether we’re gonna live or die, only when. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And that made a whole mental attitude different. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">This is why we rose up in 1944, that’s how all our brothers in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> rose in 1943, because they preferred — we preferred to die with our arms in hands, than going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And it was a question of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Both inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the adults, the priests, the rabbis, would tell the kids not to stir things up, not to form in a resistance, not to resist, because that would make things worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Well, we knew better. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">We knew that we had to defend ourselves, we had to defend our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And — and it fon — it proved that the young people were right, and when I meet now with American kids in <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> , I often am on their side, because when you are young, you are honest, you have — you are not spoiled, you — you’ve got certain inborn morals, and — and you know better than the parents, who are more scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  Well, they don’t want their children to die.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  — unfortunately, still today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  It’s true.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  Great kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Tell me — let’s go back to how things — what were some of the other activities you took part with under Ludwig’s, I suppose guidance, or — or direction, and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, he trained me t-to prepare me for arrest by the Gestapo —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And how do you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">ANSWER:  — and my torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  How do you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">How do you get trained for that?September 25, 2014</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, he did two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He taught me how to fight when you don’t have a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Fight with your teeth, how do kill a person with a knife, or with your hands, and with your teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">That’s how he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">He also prepared me how I should answer under torture, about him, because he knew perfectly well that I would be the natural one that the Gestapo would want to find him, through me. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So he said, just say to the Gestapo that you hated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">That I was a tyrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I wouldn’t let you have sex with girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I wouldn’t let you have the freedom that you wanted to do, that you really hated me, and that you will collaborate with them in trying to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And also, don’t admit that you know any German, so you’ll have a translator. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So he prepare me very well for it, and it was very useful when I was taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">torture chambers</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  After the 1943 Warsaw uprising, I believe she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> with Annie Levitch(ph) and they committed suicide in the last days of the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">But I have no proof of it, it’s just my conjecture, knowing her and her spirit, that she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , inside the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , the way I was in the underground outside the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But in 1942, Ludwig took me for a two day visit into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and he told me that he was taking me so that if he got killed there, I would be able to take out the information from inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And I was wondering at the time, if he was killed, why wouldn’t I be killed, but I didn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Took the order. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So we went in, and we went through a secret underground passage through one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and we met some Polish Jewish underground members, who brought us some dirty clothes, because we would be recognized right away in our outfits fromSeptember 25, 2014 the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , so we put the rags on. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And with — going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Ludwig was meeting the — some leaders of the Jewish underground —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What did you see when you enter — when you emerged <span class="NPIP">inside</span> —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, it was suddenly <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">There were dead people on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , children. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And then I saw a German hunting, shooting innocent people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , a pregnant woman being kicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">We had to hi — when he was shooting, we had to hide in a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> of a — of an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And then we got there, and Ludwig was asked to transmit through the underground government to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , the information what was happening to Warsaw Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">QUESTION:  What wa — okay, what kind of information —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — and what kind of requests were made’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">ANSWER:  — well, by that time, it was already tr-trainloads being taken to the gas chambers, and everybody knew what — my father told <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czerniakéw</span> what was happening, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czerniakow</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , and everybody knew what — my father told Czerniakéw what was happening, and Czerniakow committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But it — the — the wa — the west didn’t do anything to help, and it was — there were desperate attempts. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They asked to — the west to inform Germans that for every Polish Jewish life, there would be a German killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Prisoners of war, and other German citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And they realized that it was an unrealistic request, but it was a desperate move to — to — to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">They asked to haveSeptember 25, 2014 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> bombed on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And also, they asked us for arm — for information how to build <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , for concrete, and reinforced steel, so they could prepare for the uprising, and for arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I know that my own company submitted 50 — sold, or gave 50 guns to the Jewish fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And then, later on, I was in the Warsaw fire brigade, and the Germans respected the Polish firemen, because they needed it, during the allied bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the Polish firemen were very important, and the Polish blu — blue police, some of them were [indecipherable], some of them were members of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So they couldn’t — you couldn’t depend on the — but the — the — the — the firemen were under — according to German law, the police and the fire departments went under the police, under the Gestapo, under the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So the — the guy who destroyed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and murdered innocent — destroyed the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the people <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , was Stroop, Jiirgen Stroop. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And he was responsible for the Polish fire department. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And once a year there would be a parade of all the f<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">-fire trucks</span> , and firemen on it in the, you know, firefighting uniforms, before him. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And he was very proud of the Polish firemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He didn’t know that 80 percent of us were members of the underground army. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">September 25, 2014</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So, when you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was the request of a life for a life — when you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was this request of a life for a life, because so many Jews were being killed indiscriminately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  That was later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  And th — we’re able to use the fire department trucks, because the Germans would | — of course, if there was a fire in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire department trucks</span> , because the Germans would | — of course, if there was a fire in the ghetto, they would let us in through the — through — through, and then we could drop the information, and come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  So was this the only —September 25, 2014</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="918">QUESTION:  Was this the only time, after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was sealed off, that you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , or did you go in to deliver those 50 pistols?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">ANSWER:  No, no, I had nothing to do with that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  Okay, and so I want to go back to this again. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">When I asked earlier, not what happened to her at the end, but how is it that she had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when she was half and half —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, because they were considered — everybody was considered Jewish up to the third generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">If you had one grandfather who was Jewish, you were JewishSeptember 25, 2014 as far as the Germans were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">That’s how I was saying, that if the Germans knew that my father’s grandmother was Jewish, he would have been considered Jew by the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And so, for Zula(ph), and her mother, of course, who was Jewish, it’s a — it’s a given.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  But for — and this is where the juxtaposition for me sounded so confusing; that she is forced, but Ludwig isn’t.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  Well, I was invol — continued training, military training, maneuvers outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , learning about new arms, explosives. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">But soon after, in 1943, in the middle of the summer, there was a wedding of two Polish underground officers, in one of the downtown <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And there were about a hundred underground officers attending it, which is against all the rules of conspiracy, which they broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And somehow the Germans learned about it, and at the height of the marriage ceremony, the SS entered the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and arrested 89 people, and among them was Ola(ph) Solkul(ph), with whom I lived, with Steffa(ph), and Ludwig. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And she had false papers, German papers under Evee(ph) Keller(ph), and guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So, as soon as we found out that she was arrested, Ludwig left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he told — send me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my parents, so only Steffa(ph) and Marek(ph), and the grandmother were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">But about 10 days, two weeks later, we found out through our underground sources that Ola(ph) was tortured so badly that she committed suicide, and was — died, rather than tell the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">So I felt I was safe, and in the morning I went backSeptember 25, 2014 to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Ludwig stayed away, fortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Well, in the afternoon, I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and I heard banging on the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , and Steffa(ph) said, who is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And I heard, Gestapo, open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , or I will shoot through. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And I was on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , and I was going to jump into the <span class="DLF">park</span> , a <span class="DLF">public park</span> , and escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">So I opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , the <span class="DLF">French doors</span> , and I look behind me, and the Gestapo man already had a machine gun pointed at me, and said [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So I had to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">He — I was arrested on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">They — th- they check on the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">The little boy was playing over the secret <span class="INT_SPACE">safe</span> where the arms were kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And so they took me and Steffa(ph), and took me downstairs, and there were open, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes cars</span> , three of them, and they put — put us in, and took us to the <span class="BUILDING">Pawiak prison</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">QUESTION:  What’s the <span class="BUILDING">Pawiak prison</span> ?</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Were you the youngest there, do you think’?September 25, 2014</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I was the — definitely the youngest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And for all the strange things, I was selected by the adults to be the one to be representative, because every morning the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened, and I had to report, in German, that six prisoners, all here, everything in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I was very short, and then I had the <span class="DLF">door</span> slammed in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But, was the same in — in — in — in a prisoner of war camp later. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">I don’t know why, being the youngest, they had the greatest faith in me, that I would be honest, about food, cutting bread, because —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1710">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">The — there is certain amount of the same thing, because since independence, and the ones who were — never encountered German or Russian oppression, don’t fully appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">On the other hand, I think there’s still enough adults and teachers, who are teaching history, recent history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">For example, when I was there last month, I saw 100,000 young people doing a marathon on the day of the Warsaw uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">There were three days of festivities; <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , plays, movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">Thr-Three movies were made, enormous movies about the Warsaw uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">So, that’s always kept — that, together with the solidarity movement and Walesa 125 September 25, 2014 himself says that solidarity wouldn’t exist, if 1t wasn’t for the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">That the — the roots were in the fight for freedom and independence that we fought for in 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1718">QUESTION:  Well, how do you make that direct connection? </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">If the uprising hadn't happened, why would solidarity not happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1720">ANSWER:  Well, according to Walesa, the spirit of Polish history is the 19" century uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">First ni — first the KoSciuszko uprising at the beginning of the 18" century, 18 — 19" century, 1830, 1863, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">And then solidarity in 1979 —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">ANSWER:  — 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">So this was something which was passed from father to son, from the grandfather to the grandson, and kept alive the will to live in freedom, and not be satisfied to be a slave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">And that’s why Walesa says in his introduction in my new book, that if it wasn’t for our actions in 44, he feels that the solidarity movement would not exist today, and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> wouldn’t be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">He makes that very direct —</p>

<p>ANSWER:  Not many, but those mostly older and sicker, there are — a lot of in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">But the important thing was the way that the — today’s citizens treated us veterans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">Taxi drivers refused to take fees, <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735"><span class="BUILDING">Hotels</span> were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">It was just making it — us feel that they owe us a debt of gratitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">And it was very satisfying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">And young people, the — for each one of us veterans, there was always a boy scout or a girl scout that would take each one under the arms, take us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> , sit down and look after us, bring us water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">So we were — we-were — were well looked after.</span></p>
