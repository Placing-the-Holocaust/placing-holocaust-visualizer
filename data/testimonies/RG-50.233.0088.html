<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Hi, Tony.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Great. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Enjoying this a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  You’re enjoying a broken toe a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  I appreciate the opportunity of talking to you about my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I’m going to ask you to go back in time, forgetting about feet and the nice weather and take us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when you were a little girl growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">First of all where were you born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  And your birthday?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  September 22, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  My parents’ names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  My father, his name was Ernst and my mother was Jella Mendel. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That’s how we pronounced it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He was a physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Your father was a physician?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Esssen</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  And your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  She was a housewife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Now what memories do you have, if any, of growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Okay, what I’Il tell you about 1s what I remember and also what I was told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Was told by your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">An interesting fact is that I was born one week after the Nuremberg laws came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They came out September 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was born a week later. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And at that point Jews were not allowed to have anybody working in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who were Christians unless they were over fifty because the Nazis were afraid that they would intermarry or...
QUESTION:  Hanky Panky?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And so my earliest days -- you know I had a nursemaid that they had to let go and I know my mother explained how sad that occasion was so they had to let her go of this nursemaid and they changed several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There was Shvesta Gatzog or Shvesta Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So I think I got Shvesta Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She was over fifty so that was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She was nice too but from my earliest years were kind of changing caretakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There was, of course, my mother but I think she felt it would be good to have a nursemaid for me in those early years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  So your nursemaids were all elderly Aryan women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Right and they were very lovely people and my parents got along very well with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Were there other non-Jewish people in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  What I want to say is that I think Shvesta Roiskin,, Shvesta Gatzog, Shvesta Roiskin, Shvesta Maria -- Shvesta Roiskin made them..... They also could have somebody Jewish so maybe one of them was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">If you had someone who was Jewish they could be that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But I am aware that there was a lot of change in the beginning because even though the Nuremberg laws came out -- until they came to the people -- you know, a little time must have gone by, there was a lot of confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then my mother used to say that new edicts would appear like a bolt of lightning out of the <span class="DLF">air</span> overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">You never knew what was going to happen next, where the Jews couldn’t go, what they had to do or what they couldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So my parents, for example, were married at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because that was easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  When were they married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  And they didn’t go on vacation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on their honeymoon because that was already was closed off as far as I recollect so they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> on their honeymoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They got married in 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  So the Nazis had been in power for more than a year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">On my birth certificate also there’s a swastika.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My father said because of the situation we couldn’t afford it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Was he able to continue practicing medicine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Well that’s an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to protect their own as it were and Hitler couldn’t do very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until 1939 which isn’t to say that we didn’t want to leave earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">After Kristallnacht I don’t think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I wouldn’t say the fate of all Jews because it wasn’t known at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> alone with my grandfather, my father’s father, while they were getting ready in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , they bought all this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> or my grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> while they would leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  So your grandfather in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> , would that be on your father’s side of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Your grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> on your mother’s side of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  One of the stories that is told, that my father told me is that when I was a toddler we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and there were a lot of men with their swastikas and we were sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My father was trying to keep a very low profile and me being this curious little kid I started asking all about those signs that I was seeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In a loud voice Papa [vas iss dos] and my father tried to explain very quietly so that I wouldn’t cause a commotion and nobody would notice us. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I said [very indistinct] and I just kept on and on and he wasn’t able to let me know enough that I had to keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So finally he took me and we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> because he was afraid that we would get in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My father was also in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">In the early days the Nazis were imprisoning a lot of people and it seems to me from what he told me he was put in because he was vice-president of the B’nai Brith chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So they were ransoming until they got all the money he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So he was there maybe two days or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Two days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And this was to extort money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  So the fact that he was a war veteran and a physician didn’t make any difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  At that point it didn’t matter anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">At that point Hitler had taken over the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And so the army was powerless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Was this after you were born this happened or before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Oh, after. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It was after Kristallnacht I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Oh yeah, that was just before the...probably ’38 or something like that
QUESTION:  Was he still practicing medicine at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  No, he had to stop at some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There was one point where everybody had to stop who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">At that point he said if I can’t make my livelihood then I can’t live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">At that’s when he started to get ready and to find out how to get out, where we could go, who would give us the affidavit, and these must have been extremely stressful times. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">As far as my life before that I came from very comfortable milieu. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My parents’ families on both sides had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> since about the 1700s. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We were very comfortable and my life was a very good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">An interesting story is told that people like my -- once my mother told the story that if my father --- this couldn’t happen in the Holocaust though---he was so prominent, two things, first he walked into a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woolworth</span> , or some kind of a low class store, people were overheard to say well -- Dr. Mendel...[in German] if he goes in we could also go. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But more directly, when my parents were getting ready for the emigration it was around the time of Kristallnacht and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I was alone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> with my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">When they called they were told don’t come back, stay where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You won’t be recognized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> you’re too well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  So your grandparents told your parents that.....
ANSWER:  I think somebody called the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and spoke to my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My grandfather was very prominent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> , not only my grandfather but his brother had a huge practice my father inherited. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He made some discoveries with diabetes. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was very well known......[indistinct] But he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  This would have been your father’s uncle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yes, Uncle Felix. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My father called him Uncle Felix. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He was my great-uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So they stayed longer and my father treated people from the Krupp family and so they helped also and from the packing they gave him favors because 1) he was well liked 2) he was well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  So you’re saying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krupp</span> , people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krupp</span> helped your father during the emigration?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I mean we got everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">All into our [indistinct] and everything and most of 1t seemed to come from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Did your parents own their own <span class="NPIP">place</span> or were they...
ANSWER:  No, I went back there and they were renting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Apartment building</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Like a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Now you mentioned you were with your grandparents at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Did they live with you or was it just you and your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  No, this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Oh, so you stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Yeah, my parents would park me there and I would be with my grandparents but you know I’ve been in therapy and some of the stuff that’s come out you know in the last ten years even would say is that on some people I was afraid they were never gonna come back and that they wouldn’t take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So today certain reactions to things go all the way back to that time when I was left with wonderful grandparents but all I wanted to do was in a <span class="DLF">garden</span> ...
QUESTION:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Yeah, all I wanted to do was go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Home meaning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  With my parents...I just wanted my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  So would you say you were growing up half the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and half the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  No, I think most of the time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> but then when my parents would get ready for a few weeks I would stay for a time... Moving ahead ....[indistinct] well that’s some of what I remember when I was growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  So you remember seeing any other Nazis besides the ones on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> that day? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">That was the first ttme you had seen a swastika?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  That was the first time I responded out loud, so openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Did your father ever explain afterwards what the swastika meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Nobody ever explained anything to me and so I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I was a very confused little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I had many fears and once I found out in a big, long workshop that I thought that everything that ever happened that was wrong was my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">That any problems my parents had you know I just [?] </span><span class="sentence" id="140">had this feeling that I was always doing the wrong thing so everything must have been my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Nobody really ever talked to me about it because they didn’t think I would understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  So not even afterwards did they explain?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  No, not when I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">You know I’d be much older before they explained anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Then my father spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I can tell you what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We were only allowed to take out ten dollars, the equivalent of ten dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  When you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  When we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my father knew that it would be hard for us to get started and he couldn’t be a physician right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So he took toothpaste out of toothpaste containers with gloves, no well he squeezed it out with gloves and put in money with tweezers and then he sent it .... [indistinct]. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I’m not sure if he ever got the money but...
QUESTION:  Got it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Right, and there were always these obstacles. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Even when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we almost didn’t get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Many times we almost didn’t make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">At one point though in terms of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> my father didn’t want to wait any longer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he saw what was happening and so we emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  And she was liberated and then I guess she was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and then she went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> a little bit and had difficulty living with my aunt and uncle who by then had returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> because they had fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I didn’t tell you that story and so then she came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And she never wanted to talk to me about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">It was only on her death that I [indistinct] but she lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So first my father died, ’57, then my mother died in ’70, and my great-aunt 1s still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And all the stuff that came to me that I inherited she took to the Windermere to hold for me and it was all in her will that everything in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> belonged to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So when she died my friend Bernie and I [indistinct] cleaned out the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and found some of the pictures that I have here that I had never seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So I pieced a lot of this together. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">She would say little things but not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was too painful for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I remember once she showed me money from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> that they were supposedly into her views but she said it was horrible, horrible, just horrible, she couldn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">She wore black for a long time, wouldn’t wear lipstick. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">She was in mourning for a long time till her husband ....

<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Nothing about it, no incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I think she felt guilty that she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">She had a great deal of difficulty dealing with any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">By the time she died I wasn’t living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore and quite honestly I was reluctant to ask her because it wasn’t very popular yet in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I’m trying to remember when Epstein’s book came out, Children of the Holocaust so when I read it I could identify a lot with that kind of feeling [indistinct]
QUESTION:  So she really has little idea or share very little with you as to why she might have survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  It had something to do with breaking her foot and being in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> but I could never piece together how that could help her survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I think she felt very, very guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Do you know how long she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , in terms of years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Maybe not that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">You see if Simon could have stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> he might have lived too but he got deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It seemed to be that she was in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time not to get deported and it was pure luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And she never wanted to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">She kept it, just everything locked in her heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It’s just that when I wouldn’t eat or something she’d say [in German referring to eating in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ] what I’m leaving on my plate.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  She was 90 in ’76. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">That means in 1945 she would have been about 59, so she was getting along in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Was she active in anything at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , social service, because there were some activities available?</span></p>
