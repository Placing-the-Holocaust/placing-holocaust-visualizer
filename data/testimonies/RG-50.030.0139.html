QUESTION:  Let's not go there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Let's get back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You were very young when the Nazis took over in 1933?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yah, I was six years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Yes, do you remember any particular change 1n your life in terms of friends and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I lived on a <span class="DLF">street</span> , I remember vividly there, were four boys who were all the same age and all in the same grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">At the time I lived near a <span class="BUILDING">boy's school</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">girl's school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Shortly after '32, about '33 or '34, they were not allowed to play with me any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I also was in, I think about the second or third grade, I was not allowed to sit in the class with the rest of the students, I had to sit in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The teacher I had, the one I remember the best, he was very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But the principal was a Nazi, because he insisted that I was sitting, that I would sit in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I only had about one or two report cards and then I was told I would not get any more report cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And the other incident I remember quite well 1s, um, we had, we lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there are only ten Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was no professional teacher, and my mother used to teach me Hebrew, I'm talking about Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so as much as my mother could taught me the primers and the prayers and the alphabets, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was necessary that we went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">provincial town</span> , where they had a professional teacher and a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and most of the Jewish children in that <span class="REGION">province area</span> in the <span class="REGION">county</span> came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on various days of the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I remember we used to go there one day a week, and first myself and then my sister and cousins of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Another girl and my sister, and three of us used to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> once a week, I think it was on Tuesday, it was the early part of the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And we had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which was probably about an hour and then you had to walk for a bit to go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was next to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 's name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burgsteinfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I remember one incident in particular because there are always bullies on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">For some reason they knew that we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And one day I was attacked by a boy maybe in his early teens, 15, 14 or 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he threw a knife at me and cut my legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I remember coming to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where they had bring in a nurse and they bandaid me. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And then shortly thereafter I couldn't we couldn't go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Were you alone when that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No, my sister and our friends, my sister's friend, our cousins were with me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I remember that and that's about all I remember as far as anti-Semitic attack on me physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was beaten up later on in the middle '30s in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by boys in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then I couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I went once in the years -- they took me in the early days to the <span class="DLF">city swimming pool</span> and then I was told that I could march with the class to the <span class="DLF">pool</span> , but I couldn't be in the <span class="DLF">pool</span> because I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I happened to be the only Jew in the whole class, the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of 800 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But I remember distinctly that it bothered me a great deal that I could not be part of my friends to go into the <span class="DLF">pool</span> once every few weeks or once a week when the class went to the swimming outing, in the summer of course, it was an <span class="DLF">outside pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But I wasn't allowed to go in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  And when they said you couldn't have a report card anymore, did that mean you didn't do any work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yes, I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I was a good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But the principal had decided that as a Jew I was not entitled to a report card. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So I sat in the back of the class until '36 when my parents saw that it was impossible for us to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we left then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Do you remember discussions in your family about leaving, was it a surprise to you when you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  I don't remember the discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember thinking about it in depth that my father and mother thought that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would be safe for us because during the First World War <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was kept neutral just like <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was kept neutral even in the Second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Because the Germans needed <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in the First War, that's where the Kaiser ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I think my father believed that the same thing would happen again because they needed an outlet where they could escape to maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That wasn't the case because on May the 10th 1940 of course the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and they were there early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We were right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  How did you find out that you were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , who told you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I know that we went late at night by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We went over the <span class="DLF">border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  And who went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  My father, my mother, my sister, myself, and I think my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I'm not too sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My grandmother had died, my father's mother had died in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I remember because I was on vacation and I had to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I was with relatives in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I don't remember if my grandfather came immediately with us or shortly thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I think he didn't come until Kristallnacht, which is another story here. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My aunt, my father's sister, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to live with her first cousins, my father's first cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Did you take a lot of things with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Bare essentials. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I don't remember if we even took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  How about a toy? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You were six or seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">No, you were ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  I was ten years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I don't remember toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Toys weren't as prevalent then as today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Where did you go when you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  We went to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borculo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It had about 40 Jewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious town, conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And it was a wonderful life for me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of '36, until '40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the kids which I never knew before. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It so happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was killed during the war with the entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But we had a wonderful life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was very difficult for my father and mother because they came with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They had left everything behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We are not people of means. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My father had a hard life and he worked hard and there wasn't an abundance of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">To the contrary it was a struggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And not on my mother's side, they were affluent. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in the family especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> it was hard for him to begin because we had to start from point zero and it worked out quite well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  What did he do in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what did he have to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Most of the Jews in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were in cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Most the majority were in the cattle business. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My father learned the <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span> when he was a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> it wasn't possible to go in the <span class="BUILDING">cattle business</span> , that would take lots of sums of money to pay and trade, so he went back in textile, which he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And first he worked very hard with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and suitcases and went from one farmer to the next for about three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And my mother did the sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">She also had a <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> and no help. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But it was a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And then my father was able to buy a small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> on this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish family, and the son I remember sold it to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I don't know the arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And we lived behind the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And then it developed that my father run the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He went one day a week sometimes 2 days a week, to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And my mother did take a very active part in the business and did the sewing and helping in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Did you work there too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  I had to work after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I was the delivery boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And then my grandfather came. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He was living with us then. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Her name was Erica Soloman. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My mother's maiden name was Soloman. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">She went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by the local police in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They were the only Jewish family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , but during the night a few neighbors took them out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took 'em by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> over the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and took 'em over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to get 'em from not being taken to one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , wherever they were taking them in those days, probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they were immediately put under house arrest in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> by the Dutch government. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And they lived with another cousin of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">My mother uh, my grandmother rather, I think and her two sisters married in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and had their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And then the Dutch put 'em in a camp in <span class="REGION">southern Holland</span> , and then from there they were building <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> which later became the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> from about '38, '39 on. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the Canadians, I forget now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Bill, between '36 when you arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when you started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal life for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is a very good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was a very good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> even more so then than now. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Things have changed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But the Dutch were just wonderful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I felt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total separation from my surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span> , my surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> where I was born and where I grew up as a small boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I was accepted like an equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I always remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have been anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But... So it was most revealing for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  No, it didn't change radically. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It took about a year in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Yah, there were, laws were made of course and we had to turn in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and there was a curfew at night for the Jews from 7:00 o'clock on. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So not immediately, but very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Then of course we also couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any longer, to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> after about maybe eight, nine months to a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over which was a large community and they had built a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They took one of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> I think gave them and they made it into a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> every morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Were you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Because on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> we had to wear a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And when the Germans came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">law. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They had a bus system between all the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And when Germans came in we had to get up and go in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish kids out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And then when we walked -- for instance when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I remember it was quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And our classmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> , and they picked us up and took us to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And then they had to turn 1n their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , it was the end of that transportation system. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But it was good for me because we could continue our education, and they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I had by then maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">It's a little different in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> than it is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Then at one point Jews could not be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> at all any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So my father thought, and because he was told that we couldn't sit at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> either that we had to keep busy, and my father called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I had to go every morning at 6:00, go to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I worked there in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">My father had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> still, but they were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So my father arranged that I went to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Anything you do on <span class="DLF">farms</span> from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Were there other children like you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  No, not on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">This was -- other children had to do it on other <span class="DLF">farms</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">This age group. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And even old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">This was mainly because information filters down and they said if you work they don't arrest you. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They did anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Did this apply to your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">My sister, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">She was a little too young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  Do you remember how you got your star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">An edict came down and you had to buy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I remember that you had to buy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I remember that my father had to sell them because he had a <span class="BUILDING">textile store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They had a J-O-O- D. Jood. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">That's a Dutch name for "Jew" But you could not pin them on. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I remember them saying that you could not pin them on with a safety pin, you had to physically sew it on to your outer garment. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">That was very very important, I remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Did your mother make these?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">they were printed by the Germans or by edict of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">No, no, you had to buy them from some whatever <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And you had to sew them on of course, you had to do yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">My mother did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Most likely my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Were you angry that you had to wear these?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I'm sure there was an anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It was an embarrassment, it was degrading. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But there were so many things happening, one was heaped on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It was a systematic, well thought out, and very orchestrated move to degrade, to belittle, to destroy the minds of the people to make them powerless. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It's not that -- it would have been simpler if they pick us up and take us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but there was a whole prelude of acts from turning in your radios to turning in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Of turning in anything valuable, even turning in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But one could not have a radio I remember distinctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And I know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> because I remember I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for a short time during that farm episode and then I know I had to turn the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in, so I had to walk every morning to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> which was about an hour's walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And you did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I mean very disciplined for various reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But, yah, 1t wasn't an anger that I remember a deep anger at this point in my life, I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But I do remember "why"? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It just was to take away, step by step, your whole humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">There was a system of dehumanizing everything we knew of from sitting in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , wearing the star, a neighbor is not allowed to talk to you and wouldn't for fear of being put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or being ostracized. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a child the children could not play with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I remember one episode, I was standing in front of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I wanted to play so badly with the boys I used to play with, and they just said, "you can't." </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I used to cry a lot, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">While I'm talking things come back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I used to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I felt 1t even harder on my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">See, a child has so much capacity and a lot of things a child doesn't understand, and in retrospect and I've thought about it in recent years a lot, is the anguish my parents must have gone through to see number one, their own life destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They had fought for the same <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was doing it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My father was very popular, and my mother, in the local community, the <span class="BUILDING">bowling clubs</span> and the veterans organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And then when their children their own life and their children, to me it must have been a horrible, horrible part of life for my mother to see what happened to her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I mean there was no future. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And where do you go if 1t goes downhill orchestrated by a government, not only by individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">But they didn't give up easy, I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">There's a thing I remember quite vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">My father was very nationalistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He loved what he did because he was a veteran, he was wounded, he had medals from the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And on Veterans Day, what we call here Veterans Day, they had parades in those days just like we have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And the veterans had their rifles and they put their rifles over their shoulder and they march down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I remember that my mother was laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And my father he still left to go to that parade and march in the parade, but he couldn't have a rifle, and he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So he took a cane and he wasn't the only one, others did too, and they took a cane and turned the can upside down and put a flower on the top of the cane and they marched with their Christian friends, previous friends, they marched in the same parade and you could pick the Jews out because they carried a cane as a substitute for a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">In those days we didn't think much about it because that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">You made the best of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But when I think about it today it does make me angry obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So there were many instances like that, but US...
QUESTION:  What happened between you and your friends, did they all stop talking to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  All of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  All of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">There was no one who dared. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It would reflect even in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It was an orchestrated way of ostracizing the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And they didn't monkey around by saying well maybe I should or shouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They just didn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Actually, that's why my parents left. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We left early because we thought we could save ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Now, my grandmother had arranged to take the whole family out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And she bought visas for us, for herself and her two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Her daughter was married with two small children, my aunt, my mother's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And shortly before this was all going to happen, when we would leave, we found out that they were phonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Someone had taken a great deal of money from my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">She was a matronly person. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">She was very very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">She had been a widow since she was in her early 50s. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And these were phony, false, false visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So there was an attempt made to get out obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But then we also lived in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There was no communication like we have today. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And just to give you an example how small, my grandmother's phone number was number 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Number | was the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">She had the second phone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So you can imagine the system of communication in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">No one knew what was going on except what filtered down through the government's edicts and attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  You said you wanted to talk about Kristallnacht and bringing your grandmother to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Well, they came over the <span class="DLF">border</span> that night and we knew it pretty fast because my grandmother came over the <span class="DLF">border</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I don't even remember how she got there, I really don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I remember my uncles come across, but we never saw them because they couldn't stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We were not Dutch citizens, we were there on permits as aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And they let us stay there because my father did have a permit to move there in '36. -- </span><span class="sentence" id="308">but we never became, the Dutch didn't make you citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They didn't make any of the German Jews citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So I was made stateless when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared the Jew status in the Nuremberg Laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I don't remember what year that was, but I assume it was before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I think it was in '35 maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we lived as normal citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We didn't have to report or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Maybe they kept an eye on us, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But my uncles who came over during Kristallnacht could not stay with us because we didn't have the permission from the Dutch government to harbor even relatives, my mother's brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So they stayed with cousins who were Dutch citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They could not walk the streets. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They were under house arrest and then they put them in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So my uncles in essence were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> locked up from 1938 to '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They never saw outside life for those years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  Did your father lose his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> before you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  At first no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was open, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was open until we were arrested to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But he had a very difficult time getting merchandise because a lot of us was on coupons already and the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> were very little specifically because when the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> were established he had very little business, so they were based on previous businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But no, I remember that the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had some merchandise on the shelf when we walked out to the <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where they assembled all the Jews that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And we were picked up by the Dutch police. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They were not Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The Dutch police picked up us because they were told to pick up the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  Were you hungry, did you have adequate food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  In those days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  After '40?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Food was not a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farm towns</span> , it wasn't that serious in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It became serious later I am told for all the Dutch people. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But we didn't have that much of a problem with food until we were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  And you had Jewish friends?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  It wasn't so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">It was only in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , no the Dutch people didn't follow that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  Did you talk about what was going on after the Germans came with your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Yes, indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And everybody felt sorry for you, but there was nothing you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They were hard on the Dutch people too and the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">As long as they behaved and didn't do anything political they left them alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There was rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There was no gasoline, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">You couldn't buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> or tires for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> it was very severe, especially later part of the Occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But no, 1t wasn't that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We never had a shortage of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We may not have had everything, but there was no shortage of food for us until we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Just shortage of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Excuse me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  Oh, I knew quite a few people in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I mean not a lot, but several families went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">See, we were relatively newcomers 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because we had only gotten there. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You know, we weren't born there, my father wasn't born there, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So we knew... my father knew people, I knew that, but he wasn't -- I don't know, there weren't these connections like if you were born and raised with the same people. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And then I think the other issue was finances. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I mean the people were hiding people. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Most people had to, most people, if not all, but most people had to pay, there had to be some resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">My father didn't have resources, but that doesn't mean that some people may have been hidden and saved who didn't have resources, it may be so, but I know the ones that went into hiding had some resources which we didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And then the other issue was that it was well known that if you were caught, the Jew, you would be shot on sight or something very different, terrible would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Furthermore, the Christians who were hiding the Jews were treated as Jews if they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or shot too. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It was a heroic, heroic gesture, anyone who hid Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">There was some abuses, but I don't think that's major at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But the ones who hid Jews are very heroic people. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I knew some after the war, but we didn't have the connection in my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And frankly no one expected that this was a matter of either life or death. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">All we knew is we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for the duration of the war period. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And we believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Everybody believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Well, some maybe didn't, but as far as we know we believed that this was just this period of time to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Later on when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> we knew we were going to <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We know some of them were going to <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , but letters came from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was where the first Jews picked up in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and then we were told they died there from hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Our rabbi, they picked off the leadership first and the younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">But that hiding business, it's hard to explain because we lived in an atmosphere of terrible, terrible fear, so for all I know maybe my father tried and it didn't work.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I don't think so because it was adventuresome to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Maybe that's not a proper word, but the fear, you were under this terrible fear and now it was already several years for me, a lifetime at that point, that we lived under this. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So I don't remember what my feelings were. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">But I think about it since I am a father and a grandfather, that it had to tear my parents apart, their hearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It had to be unreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I don't think what can describe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">That makes me sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> it so happened that the girl I used to know, not dating, but friend, a good friend I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, he was in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She was also by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And we sat together all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And that's about all I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  This may seem a strange question, but did you date when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Did you in some way have girlfriends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  Yes, indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was -- you lived a life there, whatever that means. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I don't know if there was a movie there, I don't remember that, but it was -- I know we were talking about the entertainment they had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They had a large <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And evenings there were intellectual, there were lectures there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  Did that seem even more -- well, you wouldn't know by comparison, but urgent in a way to do that because life was so difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  It was urgent to the extent that you clung to each other because there was obviously a terrible loneliness in each person, and a terrible fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But I do remember that the friendships in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in dating, that you just mentioned as dating, friendships were very very deep and very sincere. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I didn't have anybody that I said I'm going to marry you, it wasn't even important in life to even think that, but as friendships either from before we were there or we met there and found friendships there, new friends, and you saw that among others. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And then there were movements, there was a whole movement in the camp of Halutsim’...Zionist movement who met regular. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Who had only one dream, they all would go together to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and they stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They all left together too, they all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So there was this Zionist movement, there was a cultural life for us to the extent, self-created, self- created.</span></p>

ANSWER:  And the Zionist group, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halutsim</span> , we called ourselves the Halutsim which 1s still used, but it was a youth group, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I was younger than some of those kids, but I felt very privileged to be among the bigger kids you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And the girls, we call in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> dating, but that dating was a little different, but the friendships and the discussions and holding hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  Did you have you first kiss in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  I wouldn't say it was the first one, but pretty close. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">No, yes, no, I don't know how to answer that because I don't remember the details of 1t. I do remember certain things which are not important, in general it's not a matter of seriousness, it's just teenagers, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  When you say you clung to each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Well, we were frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">There was only so much our parents could do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They had their own problems, they had their own fears and heartbreak. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So when you were with your own age group, especially girls, and I remember a few of them, we were frightened to death, and it was important that you had that emotional friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I'm not talking about sex per se, we were too young for that, but there was certainly at the age in those days when you were 15 and 16 it was a friendship where you could hold hands and embrace each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">How do we know about kissing? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Well, you kissed your parents and your sister, but not that emotion “Possibly referring to the He-Haluts (Hebrew: "The Pioneer"),a Zionist youth group. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">that we would think of today under the modern so-called post-war society thing in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">No, it was just this deep friendship and affections. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And I think they were important. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Of course the last time I held a girl's hand was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> for a long time because --

<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  And did that help?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Yes, I would think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I'm sure it did because it's got to help a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And of course we were separated when we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Tell me about the trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  I don't remember anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I know they opened it once for <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We didn't get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Apparently we took food I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I don't remember how long it took, but I remember that someone said we are going past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">bombing building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And we heard bombs drop. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">That's about all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I remember very little.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  There were other people your own age on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> or were there a variety of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  A variety, older people, younger people, babies, you name it, all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">The ones who were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , they had separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> again for reasons that only the Germans will know. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Just to have more fear than fear, create more fear than fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">They weren't with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">We never saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And them some of them, one particular family, this boy was my closest friend from the day I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> until they went in hiding, he was in that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They were found, they were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">No one survived in that entire family of many people, 30, 40, 50 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">That entire family was hidden somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">No one survived, no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So I remember he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I saw him through the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We couldn't talk to each other, just wave to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I couldn't even send him food. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">That I remember.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  No, I don't remember screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">The only screaming I remember was from the guards and the prisoners who had to get us out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , because it was a matter of you didn't walk, you ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">You had to be fast, fast, fast, schnell, schnell, schnell, heraus, heraus, heraus, schnell, schnell, schnell. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Today I know why, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> waiting to be unloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But it was always whatever you do, schnell, schnell, and heraus, heraus, heraus. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And we didn't have a chance, I didn't at least, have any chance to talk to those prisoners who were assigned to that command to do that work. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And of course language was another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We were from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the majority spoke Dutch, and we would speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">No one spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> Yiddish was not known. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I never knew Yiddish until I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So, yes, it was a rush act, schnell, schnell, schnell.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">My parents didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">My sister didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But I still believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">I couldn't function otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And I don't want to be even thinking that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I do not to be a very religious Jew, not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I got to <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and I keep the holidays and I fast and I don't eat pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But that 1s maybe because it's maybe a different world today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">If I were living in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> where this was more handy for me or I could find less excuses, I would like to live that way, I would like to spend more time studying the Torah and , 1 just don't have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I don't live in that -- which is only a cop-out on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I understand it fully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">But I'm still dreaming that some day I'll have the time to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">So I have deep pride that my kind of Jews who were int eh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with me stayed Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And there must be exceptions I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">There may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">But this is an important thing that I can think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">The same thing I believe, the deepest pride I have, I have -- and we were liberated -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And I will tell you and I have double checked there with my colleagues, there wasn't a German killed by a Jew who was a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">We took their food and we took their clothing because we needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We didn't beat him up and we didn't kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And I think that that gives me probably more pride as a Jew than anything that I can think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">That we had seen the killings and we shouldn't have been killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">There wasn't a German killed by a survivor, the Jewish survivors, because we didn't want to live like they lived with what they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And we didn't stoop down to the levels that we had seen humanity, but we wanted to get out of there the faster the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">That I will tell people as often as they ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">There was no German killed by Jews after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">QUESTION:  What did you think of other prisoners when you were there and yourself, what was happening to you and how did you view each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">ANSWER:  There wasn't an intimate relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">First of all we didn't know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">We were all thrown together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I didn't know -- I don't think I knew anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Maybe one or two, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">But that doesn't mean we were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And if you weren't in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> together you had no time to do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So there was very little social intercommunicating, discussion, because during the day you couldn't because you were watched all the time, there was no talking, and at night it was too difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Furthermore, it was a matter of survival too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">You were constantly watching over your shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">To the extent that you did receive overnight, if you got a piece of bread in the evening you'd eat it as fast as you could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">ANSWER:  Because if you kept it out they stole it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Somebody -- people were not human. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I'm not saying that they were thieves, they're not thieves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">You ate it so there was no possibility you could lose it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And were that hungry anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">But I don't remember in those days, and maybe later on when we get into the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we can talk about that, but 1t was a little different atmosphere in some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I'm thinking of for the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">There was some discussion, but as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was concerned it was all we saw was killings and dead people and beatings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1056">QUESTION:  And at night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">ANSWER:  At night they were running into the electric wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">They had the a special commander with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> who would go along the <span class="DLF">wires</span> to pick up the people who run into <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">If they had the courage to do it, they'd just get it over with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  Did you ever think about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Not to go into the <span class="DLF">wires</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Once I tempted a guard to shoot me, but it was later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">ANSWER:  No, not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Later, I wanted to get it over with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">But he didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1067">QUESTION:  You talked about getting a bowl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Was that an individual bowl or was this a bowl that was shared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">ANSWER:  No, it was shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I remember you had to share it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Two people, three people, four people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">QUESTION:  How many of you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But you couldn't lay on your back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">That much I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">You had to be on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> or the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">QUESTION:  Did you talk at night?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, it didn't help me of creating the situation because I think the situation was created strictly by accident and maybe with the help of God, but it certainly helped me to keep my senses to the extent and to have not all these horrible things penetrate my mind, because I'm certainly not a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And what I have seen I should be a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">It happened to a good friend of mine, a friend I had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a young boy my age who came out, and we can talk about it later, and became a criminal, a son of a rabbi, a Polish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He became a criminal in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> after the war.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  Well, we heard a lot of screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">The screamings we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">We heard the screamings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">That we knew.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I remember, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">He worked on the work gangs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">All I remember there were work gangs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1246">QUESTION:  Did you lose a lot of weight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I never became a Muselmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Do you know what a Muselmann was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1250">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">Explain it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">ANSWER:  A Muselmann were really the ones which it would be unfortunate to see today on television when you see <span class="COUNTRY">Somalia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">That's how a lot of not all, most of our people looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But if you get to that stage, since there was no help, that's how they ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And they called them newswoman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I can't watch that on television I swear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I've seen a lot as you well know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">When I see that <span class="COUNTRY">Somalia</span> thing, I'm ashamed to say that I cannot watch it, I have to turn my head away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">It bothers me no end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And that's how a lot of our prisoners, all throughout the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1261">QUESTION:  Did you ever see yourself in a mirror at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1263">QUESTION:  In a glass?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1264">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And you'll find out why in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there they got into, but not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , uh-uh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to say about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1268">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">A lot of things are in my heart and my soul and my mind, but I don't know anything in particular I can think of at this moment except that 1t was so overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">People say well why didn't you do something, why didn't you escape, why wasn't -- the question isn't even justifiable because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> the fear, the electric wires, the beatings, the hunger, the starvation, the degradation, you know, the way you were treated, you never had time to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And then again I have to admit I'm in such a hypnosis still about that today, that now when I do remember things like chlorine, I can't stand the smell of chlorine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">When I have chlorine in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> sometimes, especially here you Washingtonians, I can't stand your water because it has a chlorine smell and it reminds me of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , and all the camps for that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">QUESTION:  Why does it remind you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">ANSWER:  Because they used to spread chlorine around for disinfectant and that smell was always overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And the burning of hair, I can't bear to smell that, for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Or flesh because it reminds you of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">But you asked me have you been back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I will not go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">I will never go back to any camp, and I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">I don't want to wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I think that's what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">I'm afraid to wake up, really wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And since I'm having a very good normal life, and I think I can function quite well, I believe, maybe not everybody agrees with me, but I agree with me on that issue, I don't want that potential interference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">So I want it to stay the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">That's why I've never done an oral history until now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And look how many years, 48 years, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Yes, let's leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and maybe something else will come to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">But it's very deeply buried, it's very deeply buried, and let's leave it that way for the time being at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">QUESTION:  So let's talk about your friend coming to see you about going on this trip unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">ANSWER:  Yes, it's called transport unknown, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And we went on that, 300 men from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I believe they were all from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1292">QUESTION:  And he's the one who helped you get on this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">ANSWER:  He helped me indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Without him I wouldn't be around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And how he did it I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And it could very well be that part of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> I was in, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I remember he said you must go on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Because I asked him -- no, I didn't ask him, he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I said what should I do, and he said you go because I'm going on it and he took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And then we went back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  Took the same kind of a trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">I remember they gave us a piece of bread when we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">I don't know why I remember that, but I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Maybe I was very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And then we went in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I don't know how long this trip was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">It couldn't have been very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">If it was a day or two or one day, I don't know how long it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">I know that we ended up in a very large <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and then of course we found out it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And this was in the summer of '43 I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I don't know the dates because we didn't know dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">The only reason we knew it was Sunday in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was because it was selection day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">That's the only reason we knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And then we were marched from the <span class="DLF">railroad yards</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to this bombed city, this bombed section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And there were fires still going, and there were many dead bodies laying in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and a lot of debris. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And I remember there were no <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , that there were sections of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">They marched us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">We found out later this was the ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And we marked in, and I think the first couple of days we slept <span class="NPIP">outside</span> somewhere until they built this <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , a wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Better ones than we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I must say that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">QUESTION:  And who built these, did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">ANSWER:  Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">There were foreman there who were not prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">But the prisoners did all of the labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Us guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And then when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , to preserve as much raw material as we could find from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transformers</span> to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and I happen to be, for a reason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant dynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And then the Germans handled the plunger, the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">We had to set the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And I remember a few occasions they, for joy rides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">I got hit over my legs a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't have decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And that's what I did for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30 guys, we had to find <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transformers</span> in <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , electrical transformers, and we had to put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And that also was part of the war machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And then I worked for quite a while in the <span class="DLF">railroad yards</span> where the equipment was transferred to and from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> , the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">So that was about what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And one day I remember -- oh, and my friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good job, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span> , army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys maybe they feed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when two boys, two boys from <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , they were very nice boys, you know, my age, and two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and we went there on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">army post</span> , German army post. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">They were all SS troops, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And we dug fortifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">We have to dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And they beat us up terribly that day, just beat us up terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And two of the boys were killed that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">One of the brothers and one other man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So out of the five only two walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">So that night when I found my friend I tell him don't do me any more favors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">And so that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And then I worked in <span class="BUILDING">Laundry</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always helping me, he was always helping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was different because we lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , about two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> they was building. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">And they give us one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then we built a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">We all got to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">So out in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there and the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and then during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and 300 were amplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And at the tail end we got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , there were 3,600 prisoners there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And a lot of them died even during this period while we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">But 3,600 and they were mostly Hungarian Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1361">QUESTION:  All men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1362">ANSWER:  All men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">No, we never saw women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">The only time we saw women was when we were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> going to some work details on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">In addition to that they also did a lot of shooting of Polish political prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we had to burn the corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">There were a lot of corpses when we got there first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">We found <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> full of corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">That's a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> they had there and lots of bodies we found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">We burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">There was stacks we had to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And one day we spend a few days in the <span class="BUILDING">Pawiak</span> , I don't know about ten of us who got sent there for a detail, and --
QUESTION:  Do you want to explain Pawiak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1372">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Pawiak</span> was a fellow <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City of Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I don't know if it's still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">But we were sent there for some work detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I remember spending there a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">I remember, the only thing I remember this heavy heavy stone <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And the fed us soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">That shows you what you remember, some odd things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And it tasted like pure soap water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">So I asked them why is there so much soap 1n there, and the reason, this person explained, whoever it was, said apparently the soap, and I'm not talking about the Jewish people, I'm talking about the prisoners in this Pawiak, the reason they gave them this soap, they threw a bar of soap in every soup kettle because 1t would decrease their sexual desires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">Soap or whatever chemical, that's what they explained to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Because it tasted like soap, which was even delicious, better than what we had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">But I remember they used that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">We didn't have that problem, the Jewish prisoners, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we didn't have the hunger because we found a lot of food in the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , staples. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">There were still staples to be found, barley, things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1387">QUESTION:  And you were allowed to keep these?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1388">ANSWER:  If you could find it and could hide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">If they caught you you were in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">But we also had other <span class="DLF">avenues</span> , and while we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the polished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the clothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in, they had this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a horse 1n front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked us, only because it was a business deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , Jews were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , who once had done the uprising, and they were still in <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and they came out when the dynamiting started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And when the Germans of course saw them they shot them on site. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">But I remember also one day there was a boy and a girl came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">The Poles had been supplying them with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">And they run out of money and out of gold and I saw a Pole kill this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">He killed her because he didn't want to have her alive so in case she would implicate him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">They weren't very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">And they were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">And I remember we worked in the <span class="DLF">railroad yards</span> and they had <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> material like uniforms and shoes, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish railroad people, traded with them for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">So the hunger was not as bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> as it had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1405">QUESTION:  What was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> situation like, you said it was better?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1406">ANSWER:  Well, it was more modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">I'll use those words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">But they were a little better and there also was heat, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">A typical <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish stove</span> out of stone I think they were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">I remember there was heat in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Not always that we had something to burn, but there was enough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , so it didn't cost anything to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">But there is one point I want to make that just came to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this entire issue of the Jews, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people was a very large money-making event for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">That served and financed the biggest part of the war industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">You realized that every person who went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> that I know of, and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> I'm sure the same, and all the gas and all the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> in the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they looked in your mouth and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my father had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was enormous hordes of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And I remember one day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> I found in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , someone had found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">Was worth about, maybe 5-6 carats of diamond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three days before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">He thought he made a big purchase. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had no bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">So there was so much, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">But the wealth of just the clothing alone, you'll see the lists that we have at our <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and the valuable things just pulled out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and that's done in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> , that financed the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">It was a money making event for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">It was a money making event. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">Aside from they hated the Jews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">The clothing, the hair was sold all over the world, recycled in some form.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1429">QUESTION:  When I mentioned whether you had seen yourself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> you said no, but you didn't explain?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1430">ANSWER:  We, we were working in all these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , while we were working there were some mirrors there and you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1431">QUESTION:  Were you surprised at what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1432">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">You didn't have much time for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">It didn't make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">It didn't make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">What did a mirror mean to us, what did a piece of gold mean to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">Gold had nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">There was no one to sell it to or give it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">It was almost laying on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">It had no value, what could you do with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">If you couldn't get food with it, it doesn't mean a damn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">So that taught me, and I've said it often to younger people, that wealth is only good if you buy a very fancy painting, it's only good if you can enjoy it and look at this painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">But what happens if you need to sell it and there is no one to buy it, then whatever you paid for this write it off real fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">It has no value if you can't sell it, if there's no buyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">And that's what happened when I had those four pieces of diamonds in my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">I had one buyer and he didn't survive because he gave me his bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">He was dumb enough to do it, but I was at that point seasoned, and I don't want to say smart, certainly seasoned that I knew I couldn't do anything with the diamonds except I needed a greenhorn to sell it to because I was hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1448">QUESTION:  Were the relationships among you as prisoners there, 3,600 you said, not that you had relations with 3,600 people, was it different than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1449">ANSWER:  No comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">Much much easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">It was easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">But we were under the treat of being killed by selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">We died because there was typhoid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> by the way, and I had typhoid, but a very mild case, and I wasn't in the <span class="BUILDING">Krankenbau</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> so-called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">But I got out not very much before when the Russians broke through and got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">But I was in there for a while, not long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And many died because there was typhoid in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">That's why they kept shin the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">There were 3,600 left at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And I think at one time there was probably close to 5,000 there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> replenished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">That number is -- but I know it was more than 3,600. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And he was told to kill them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And I'm told, and this 1s all hearsay, that the Polish underground who was watching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> very much so because they used to take, the Polish Resistance --brought them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and shut them in there with us -- on one <span class="DLF">wall</span> there and we had to turn them then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">The Polish underground allegedly told the Germans that if you kill all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for them to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the Russians were breaking through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">So one morning they had 300 in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> still, who couldn't get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">They shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">300, correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And 300 were kept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And the reason I know is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a Berlin Jew, and he was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">And those 300 were kept there to destroy all evidence, and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">That we were told later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">I don't know how I know, but I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And because they were killed while we were marching out already, they just burned the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or dynamited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">It was done very very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">And 3,000 marched out, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">Number one, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly and we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And they left their corpses right on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army truck</span> and they shot those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">All men, there were no women there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">They were all men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And we marched and here 1s the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came, it was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we were going like this with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">soup pan</span> and we tried to catch the raindrops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">We were very very thirsty, almost to the point of sanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">People were going insane, people were drinking their urine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">And all of a sudden we came over on a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we saw a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And they took us over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and there was a huge <span class="DLF">field</span> there, an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and we went in that <span class="DLF">field</span> apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And we pushed, the masses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Of course it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third hundred, very up front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">We got into this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , you could wade into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and we drank and we drank and we drank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that water they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> so we couldn't walk, and they wouldn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and get to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">So they start shooting from the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">They used machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">They shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">And I remember, because I wake up often, that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> turned as red as blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And the Jews wouldn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">Our people would not stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">They kept on pushing from the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">And they couldn't stop the Jew and these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">On the <span class="REGION">German side</span> , they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> with the dogs and when the dogs got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> the Jews stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">They wouldn't stop for the bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">And then they stopped pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">I was out by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Because, you know, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> so I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">None of us could swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I don't know how many could swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I know I couldn't swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">I told you I couldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">They never taught me how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">So the soil was just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the Red Sea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">There's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">And they killed a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">They killed, in my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">No one knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">But there were very few who got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the end we got in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">I know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that much I remember, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zychlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">That much I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">Because you could see the names on there, and I remember Zychlin, so I knew that we had marched due west from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and then we start trip in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1522">QUESTION:  And why did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1523">ANSWER:  We back in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> for quite a while, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">And there was no water and no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">But I know we used the dead bodies to sit for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> alongside. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">And I remember that --
QUESTION:  Who did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">ANSWER:  And then --
QUESTION:  So that was the worst experience 1n those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1529">ANSWER:  That was, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">That was the last time I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">And I remember when they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and very few got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">I believe only maybe 200, 300, 400 at the most. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1533">Technical conversation]
QUESTION:  I hate to ask you to do this, but can you re-describe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zychlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1534">ANSWER:  After we went through that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I don't know how much time there was, not much time until we were back in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zychlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">I know that's where we started this trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">We were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and for how long I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">I know a lot of people died en route because we had no food and no water after we had gotten out of the water that day in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">But no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">And we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">That much I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And I think we were only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> for maybe a day or two or less and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allach</span> , which is a side <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">We ended up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">No, pardon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , I'm too early, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and I don't know where we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , but I know that about 200 to 300 only got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">We sat on the corpses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1547">QUESTION:  You said that this was the worst <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1548">ANSWER:  Well, because there was these people, first of all they were in very bad shape when we got started on this death march, then that river episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">We had drank too much water without food and there was dysentery, what do you all it, dysentery, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1550">QUESTION:  Dysentery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1551">ANSWER:  Dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">So everything there was just horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">And they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">Some were delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">And when we got out we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And we didn't stay there too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , I don't know how, but I think we went in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> again, but I'm not too sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">It could have been <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">I think it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">We were taken out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> again and we were taken to <span class="REGION">Landsberg area</span> , <span class="REGION">Kaufering area</span> , and there were a lot of small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there were other people there already and we were thrown in with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">I don't know how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">I think there were maybe 1,000, 1,500 people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">They were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">They were put on top of --they dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and put a V, two <span class="DLF">roofs</span> , I can't think of the name right now, but you had to step down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">You sat down there on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And we were in there for quite a while, from '44 until -- we worked in various things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">The biggest work they did was digging underground <span class="BUILDING">munitions factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">What the Germans did, they built those V2, it's V2 things they were building out there, but we were building the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">And they used us prisoners, thousands of prisoners, to build a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , a mountain of dirt and sand and gravel, and when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> was high enough, maybe 40, 50 foot high, they carried over the wooden pallets and wheelbarrows and then they poured cement on top of it and then they washed it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">So they built a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> reversing the <span class="DLF">trench</span> , see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1573">QUESTION:  Did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1574">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">I worked there to carry dirt up these planks, you walked up and you dumped it and you got more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">So you had this hugh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">And then they put lots of cement around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">I don't know, I didn't know much about construction, at least not what I know today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">And that was used for the V2 rocket engines up there on the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">We lost of lot of people there because there was typhoid again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">The food was very mediocre of very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">There were lots of beatings but not as much as we had seen in previous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">Everything was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">And the attrition was very very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">But there bodies weren't burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">They were taken to a <span class="DLF">site</span> in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> , hugh <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">I don't think they have ever been found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">I wouldn't be able to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">They were huge <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">It's not very far from the <span class="BUILDING">Landsberg prisons</span> where Hitler had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">It's very close by there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">But huge <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And it was so bad that we had a lot of suicides there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">People were going into the electric wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And I remember that's the only time I ever saw cannibalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">There was so little food in '45 there in January and February and March that we saw that they were cannibalizing the bodies and people were eating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1597">QUESTION:  Were you tempted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1598">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">No, I never was tempted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">I wasn't that bad off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">I was bad off, but not that bad off yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">But I have seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">You saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">And the Germans caught those people and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">So either they were dead or they went into electric wires.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1606">QUESTION:  So this was surrounded just like the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1607">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">Except it was smaller than the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we had been in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">There must have been maybe a dozen of them out there in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">There were a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaufering</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , and the names just --

QUESTION:  And what did they do for uniforms, did you have the same uniforms?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1616">QUESTION:  You didn't change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1617">ANSWER:  Well, I don't know how we got -- we may have given them when they were torn and you got others, but we always had those stripers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">And I remember it got very cold in '44 and '45 because it's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And that took a lot of lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1620">QUESTION:  Were you able to get additional clothes somehow? </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">Did you steal clothes from the people who died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1622">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">If you could, but you had to show them -- there were inspections too, so if you were caught, if you were caught anywhere with more than what you were supposed to have you'd wish you hadn't done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">They killed you or beat you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">Then there were many days when the people did escape or tried, and they caught them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">I've never seen anybody that I know of who got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">And when they caught them, they had latches and they had this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> you had to bend over like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and lots of hangings, lots of hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">As you may notice I haven't gotten into any of the gory things about brothers had to hang brothers if they knew it, and lots of beatings right in front of the prisoners when there was roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">Daily almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Findings ways to keep your mind -- a lot of beatings, a lot of hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">Not so much shootings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">Shooting was only when they started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And they tempted you constantly by throwing a cigarette butt out and if you were dumb enough to run after that you were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">But lots of hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">And then they brought in next to us a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with women, with 30, 40 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">And they used them to do their kitchen work and I think administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">And they have used these women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1638">QUESTION:  What do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1639">ANSWER:  They used them as prostitutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">They are mostly -- they were Czech, some Hungarians and some -- Jewish girls, all young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">They killed them at the tail end.</span></p>
