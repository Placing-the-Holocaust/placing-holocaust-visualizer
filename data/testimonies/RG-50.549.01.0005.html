<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  I'm going to speak with you today mostly about the period after the war and liberation, but I do have one question about the time that you spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which is this: at the period when you were still with your mother and father, did they ever sit you down and, in essence, sort of give you advice on how to survive, try to teach you a survival strategy, or did they themselves know what actually might work in that situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, I -- not really in any sort of formal sense, at least, I don't remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Of course, as a child, you probably learn much more from observing than you do from being told things. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">But I do remember my father saying -- when we were -- when he and I were left alone -- that the one thing that was critical was not to eat food that was dirty or contaminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">That's the only sort of thing I remember because a lot of people would try to eat things out of garbage cans, and then of course get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He always warned me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Otherwise, I really can't think of them sort of telling me “You should do this or that,” but one of course saw a lot of things that one had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I observed my father, who's great strength was that, that you could see that he always thought things out before he did it, and he would not be sort of cowed into Thomas Buergenthal 2 November 28, 1995 Page 2 running but he would make his decision and then stick by it and that was something I noticed, that a lot of people got killed or were caught because they acted too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They didn't sort of take account of the environment and then act. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">That's something he did; he was a master at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  There was a point where you had been separated from your mother and you were able to see your mother briefly, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Did she say anything at that point, give you any advice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  No, but, you know, I think both my father and mother sort of knew that I -- I had sort of grown up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And they probably knew that there wasn't any advice that they could give me that I sort of, that I hadn't already been doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Really the only advice or the only goal of our life, the long-term goal, was to stay alive, and the short-term goal was to have something to eat that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And that was -- so survival was the long-term goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But I really can't remember that they said it, or for that matter that they had to say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I think they probably knew that I knew what had to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  In listening to your testimony that you gave on video tape, I was struck by how you were able to be in a situation and make the best of it, for instance, by becoming an errand boy to one of the German soldiers or to a Kapo; or later, right around liberation, you became a mascot to a group of Polish soldiers, and every time there you are 1n those situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">How did you end up in those situations? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Thomas Buergenthal 3 November 28, 1995 Page 3
ANSWER:  You know, it's hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I've never thought about it, but as I said, I'd grown up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it seemed that sort of the -- that there were certain things you had to do in order to be able to survive, and in order to be in the position where you could survive, and those things sort of came naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I don't know, I must say I've never thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The mascot part -- this was after liberation -- there that was really not planned at all or—because what happened was that I was liberated and we met these Polish soldiers and they knew that I spoke Polish, and they thought I was Polish, and they took me with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And then sort of the mascot part came naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So I can't claim any credit for having known what I was doing, at that stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  You say that you grew up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and certainly, when your life was disrupted, you were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong, when the last <span class="NPIP">place</span> you were was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">How did you grow up, what happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who was that boy or boy adult when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very little from that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was born in 1934, so in '39 I was five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was a scared little boy, that's all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I remember our crossing the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and worrying that something would happen to my father and knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to happen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the Thomas Buergenthal 4 November 28, 1995 Page 4 first time in my life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the war and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably 1943, because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they, when they dissolved the ghetto and sent most of the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my parents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And in '43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my parents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then, of course, when I was left --
QUESTION:  Such as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and when that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to be seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then what happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up on one of these <span class="DLF">fields</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in front of everybody, and said to him, "This is my son." </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And this man looked at me, and I said to him, in German, "I can work." </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And, you know, it just came out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">How do you say it in German? “</span><span class="sentence" id="44">Ich kann arbeiten’’? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And his response in German Thomas Buergenthal 5 November 28, 1995 Page 5 was "Na, das wollen wir mal sehen” -- ““Let’s see” -- and he let me live. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">This was -- I was the only one of the children from that -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> who survived that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">There were two others who hid in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they took all of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And that was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have to save my own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right into the belly of the beast. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You went right face-to-face with the danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of analyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways and that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke German, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from Der Stuirmer, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And suddenly to have this kid talk to them, it personalized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I think this was my father's -- he sort of contributed to my doing what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He must have said himself, "You have to." </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, "You have to tell them you can work." </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It could well be, but it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And after that, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> again, the first time, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had known before, because it was a man who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> and was shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> two years before we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, by the Thomas Buergenthal 6 November 28, 1995 Page 6 time we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But he treated his friends well, and he sort of took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was a terrible sort of society, to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I also -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and I must -- I don't know how that came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But what I remember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit outside his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort of report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So I became the one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and report it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they didn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how did you cope with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He was a very, he was very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He never mistreated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But he was quite brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He would beat people if he saw them not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And so I figured out he would do that and so when he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make certain motions. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the feather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat Thomas Buergenthal 7 November 28, 1995 Page 7 a lot of people if he caught them not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused me, never mistreated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to have a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and he would hand me the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and put it in the <span class="BUILDING">bicycle stand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And believe it or not, in all this environment in which we lived, I learned to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> with this SS man's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You know, a child 1s a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and see you playing with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as long as I didn't break it, I was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear factor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing this or doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not because I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was any reason to be afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There were many reasons in the camp to be afraid, but not to these sort of episodes. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day -- I remember breaking in with a friend of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of the SS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it sort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps Thomas Buergenthal 8 November 28, 1995 Page 8 be chosen to go into the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">After all, you saw this happen often, every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Did you imagine that happening to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the <span class="DLF">food line</span> , and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing really very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there, that was a reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed and I knew exactly what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">As a matter of fact, I was in situations where I thought I was finished, there was no way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">No, that fear, and that fear was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing more to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over me, I thought I was going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I had done everything possible not to get caught and there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But it didn't last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">You know, the survival instinct comes right back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Where were you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  I was at liberation, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> which is about 20 kilometers outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And by that time I had survived the death march but lost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They had sort of a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> set up, because it was one of these model camps, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demonstration camps</span> , where they would keep people and could show that they were Thomas Buergenthal 9 November 28, 1995 Page 9 actually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But it was a model camp, and I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I had two toes amputated. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were much sicker than I, we were left behind in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And the assumption was that they were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was able to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I think I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was strange, after the evacuation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it was very strange but it was very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And then you begin to hear artillery fire coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I think I went to sleep, evacuation must have been the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The next morning I got up and it was very, very quiet except for the shooting coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I crawled out, went out and looked up and saw in the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , over the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> -- they always had a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there, the machine gun was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I came back and told people. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Of course, nobody believed that this was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And then we just waited and the shooting came closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had a big bell in the middle of this <span class="DLF">field</span> , and a Russian soldier had driven in with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and was ringing the bell saying, “You're free.” </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28, 1995 Page 10
QUESTION:  In what language?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It must have been in Russian, but Russian and Polish 1s relatively close. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace we wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you go the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And the first thing that we did was to storm the <span class="NPIP">place</span> with the SS kept their supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick and everybody dragged themselves to the <span class="BUILDING">supply place</span> and people began to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was very lucky for me that I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I remember finding a pickle. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was bread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It probably saved my life because a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged themselves and got quite sick and many of them died. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I just couldn't swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his early 20s and I—we -- decided we were going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So we just went out on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were some women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we -- the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> -- this was the city of where the camp is, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , 1s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienberg</span> , and we must have been in the area of that, moving away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The <span class="BUILDING">German houses</span> were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often times the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we just moved from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the other, until these Polish soldiers Thomas Buergenthal 11 November 28, 1995 Page 11 came and started talking, they talked to the women, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And then they saw me and they said, "Where are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I said that I didn't know where I was going, I was trying to find my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And they said, "Well where they would be?" </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I said, "They would probably be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ," and so they took me with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Let's go back a couple steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was that scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Did people come out and stand around, then did you guys hug each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Was there a feeling that you were really liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by British troops, they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We were none of these scenes as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The Russians just told us, "You can go." </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There was no effort made to help us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I don't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be shot, but none of that -- 1t was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I really don't remember even realizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started shooting into the <span class="DLF">air</span> , and it came, sort of, on my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But I didn't have any sense of the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I was alone in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Thomas Buergenthal 12 November 28, 1995 Page 12
QUESTION:  And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , did you feel frightened that Germans could come up and recapture you, perhaps? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">What was the mood like, or were you just sitting back with your feet up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and having a nice time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, where we were afraid, of course, was when we were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we didn't know what happened to the Germans, whether they would come back and whether it was really true that they had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But once we were out, I don't remember worrying about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It seemed that it was over, and the fact that the Germans had just disappeared without a trace, the soldiers, must have had that impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But I just don't remember that maybe as a child you're liberated, you're free. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">No, I had no sense that there was any danger from the Germans at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Of course, I then ended up, when I was a mascot, in the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and that was quite -- there was a really almost hand-to-hand combat and there it was quite dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">First you met some soldiers from the Polish army, tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">How did you meet them and then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Well, they came to one of these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and I must say, it's hard for me to sort of remember very clearly, how it came about that they took me with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They were members of the First Polish Division, the so-called Kosciusko Thomas Buergenthal 13 November 28, 1995 Page 13 Division,’ which had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">These were people apparently who had been, at least the officers, members of the Polish army in '39 who were then shipped to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And when the Russians needed troops, they were brought back and given a chance to fight in the Polish army under Russian control. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I, so this was the group and I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The soldiers who took me in, they were members of the scout company, so we were sort of the forefront of the division. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They gave me -- they made me a small uniform and I had shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They even gave me a small revolver, another revolver -- a automatic pistol. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They had found a circus horse some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a pony, and -- because much of the army was still horse-drawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They had supplies of the Russian and Polish army -- was still brought in by horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">There was a lot of horses, and I had my horse and I could keep up with the soldiers, and I had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">One of the things I remember doing -- this was a great sort of past time at that point, this shows you how children are children -- shooting at things that I don't know whether people still know what that is -- the electric wires and telegraph on poles are held up, wired around porcelain, white porcelain sort of, what would you call it, cups or -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The big game was to shoot at those things and shoot them down because, of course -- that was one of the pastimes I engaged in with my Polish soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And also I learned, the one of the people who ' The Taduesz Kosciusko Division, a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command, appeared in July 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Thomas Buergenthal 14 November 28, 1995 Page 14 took care of me was a shoemaker for the company, another one was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I think -- I don't know whether I could still make a pair of shoes, but I actually observed how you make shoes and I helped and I probably at one point could have made a pair of shoes from scratch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  So here you are, you're a little boy, probably less than six weeks ago you had been on a death march out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all of a sudden you're dressed, you have a uniform, and you're riding a miniature pony with Polish army division.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  It's -- when you think about it, it reads like, sounds like, a novel from Garcia Marquez,” but it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And it, the strange thing is that the sort of, the absurdity of it, the comic aspect of it never occurred to me as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Its -- you know, at the same time, all of this I thought was going to lead to my being reunited with my parents, and I never even thought that this wasn't going to happen, this was all part of a process. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">In the meantime I could eat and I no longer had to be afraid and I had fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I had a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Actually, on the food, I should tell you that I, since I had no appetite and the Poles were quite concerned that I couldn't eat, they started giving me, at first, a half a spoon of vodka, then a spoon of vodka, and that stimulated my appetite at the point where I could really keep up with them to drinking vodka because it was my medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That was sort of the only lingering thing that had survived from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Well, of course, I had -- -my amputation was still—I had to change bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I did Thomas Buergenthal 15 November 28, 1995 Page 15 all of that myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I don’t even remember ever being taken to a doctor when I was liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Tell us more about the eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">What could you eat, and how did that gradually change? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Was there some food that was more comforting than others, or when you were able to be around larger amounts of food, perhaps with the Poles, the Polish army division, were there some types of foods that you began to really want to have an appetite for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  No. [</span><span class="sentence" id="200">end of side one of tape one| Tape 1, Side B
ANSWER:  What I remember was the Poles would drink a lot of vodka, eat bread and smoked bacon with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And that’s the sort of food I remember eating—a lot of bread, and bread, of course, I could eat, although I really didn’t have much appetite. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But with the vodka, I ate and drank whatever they did, and I remember a lot of bacon, that the poles usually drink this with vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But there must have been other food, I just don't have any memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The only thing I remember is that when we stormed that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , still, that all I could eat was a pickle, and I hadn't eaten a pickle for a * Garcia Marquez, Gabriel José (1928-), author. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Thomas Buergenthal 16 November 28, 1995 Page 16 long, long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Did it bother you that you had been deprived of food for so long? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">You must have fantasized about food or talked about it, and then you could finally eat more freely, and you weren't hungry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  No, that never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It occurs to me now when I know I shouldn't eat and I have what I -- so now it's much more real. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Now so often I think, oh here's all this food that I could eat and as a child I was starving and couldn't eat it and now I'm not allowed to eat it or shouldn't eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But no, I didn't, and I think it has a lot to do with having, being a child and taking a lot of these things for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">This was life and this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">One day you don't have anything to eat and the next day there's suddenly food. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But I remember though, for years afterwards, would always think that you should always eat before you did anything of importance because you never knew when you were going to eat again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  Did you find when you were younger, that you ate quickly, as if someone might take the food away from you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  That could be because I still eat quickly, probably too quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I don't know whether it's related to that or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">There were certain foods that, you know, bread of course, to this day good bread is something that I -- I always use the example that when I hear the word bread in German or Polish, I can smell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">It has sort of an emotion attached to it, whereas the English word for bread is a word that I learned, it's an Thomas Buergenthal 17 November 28, 1995 Page 17 intellectual, is an intellectual concept, but it doesn't have all the emotion tied up with the words chleb,* or the word Brot* in German, which was all of the things that I was deprived of and that I needed the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The one thing that I thought I would never eat again would be turnips because we used to get turnip soup in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , with a little piece of bread which was often the only meal we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But now I find that even well done turnip quite good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Can the smell of it or the taste of it, does it bring back memory flashes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Not anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But good bread still brings back sort of feeling of how wonderful it is to be able to have this, which I didn't have because we really lived on bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It was the most important thing, and to this day, I really can't get myself to throw away bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Stale bread is something that I find all kinds of excuses to let somebody else throw it away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  That's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So instead of resenting or hating the bread because it's all you had, you actually sort of cherish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The turnips I hated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Does your family recognize that about you, the kind of attachment to bread, and will they tease you about it or even get a little frustrated with you: “Why are you holding onto these bread crusts?” </span><span class="sentence" id="232">> Bread (Polish). * </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Bread (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Thomas Buergenthal 18 November 28, 1995 Page 18
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The problem is that, of course, they know that for some reason, it must be poetic justice, that bread has the worst weight-gaining effect on me, and so I'm not really supposed to eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I eat hardly any bread except for when I'm in Europe where my discipline goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And they know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Actually bread and sausages, which, of course, I can't eat because I had a bypass a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">All of the things that I missed as a child I can't eat now. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It's a small price to pay for survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Can you tell us now about being a young boy just liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and you have hooked up with this group of Polish soldiers? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">War is not over and you are with them and you go essentially into military situations with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Well, the first real military situation I got into was, I helped liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while the battle for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was still raging and we were camped in the <span class="DLF">park</span> near where the rocket artillery that the Russians had. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We're shooting over at the Germans and the Germans were shooting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I slept in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> because there was still fighting going on, and as we drove into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , you could see there were Russian soldiers, dead soldiers on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , Germans on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The battle was still raging for about two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But then of course, the Germans surrendered and we actually took German prisoners at the end of the -- when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But during the battle, you know, people got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">That was a danger that somebody could get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Actually some people from our company who had Thomas Buergenthal 19 November 28, 1995 Page 19 ventured out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , the hand grenade was thrown -- because the Germans were still occupying the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> -- but nothing happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I didn't participate in any of the fighting, I didn't shoot either. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But we were counting because these rocket-propelled grenades that the Russians had, the Kosciusko would shoot out, sort of, six or 12 at the same time, and they were supposed to be moving because you can very easily locate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And we were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I remember the Polish saying that they really should be moving because the Germans could find where they were and then start bombarding us and them. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But the Germans, at that point, German artillery was no longer very effective and nothing happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  Were you frightened at that point and you wished that you had not hooked up with these Polish soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Oh, no, I didn't wish that I hadn't hooked up, but I'm sure I was frightened, naturally, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It's a long time ago, when you think this is in 1945, late April, beginning of May of 1945; it's a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But I remember the concerns that we all had about German artillery hitting us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  What was it like for you to see the German soldiers brought into custody, taken prisoners? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">What were your feelings toward them? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Did you feel like you wanted to go up and say something to them about what you had experienced yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Well, I was delighted obviously, that they were prisoners of war and we were being guarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I don't remember, first of all, I don't remember any of the Poles attacking Thomas Buergenthal 20 November 28, 1995 Page 20 any of the German prisoners, and I don't remember having that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I remember having that feeling very much when I came back and I was reunited with my mother in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and seeing -- we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , my mother's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> -- and sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> on a Sunday and seeing the German families taking a walk and my father hadn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And at that point, you know, the desire of sort of seeing -- when I first came back I would love to mount the machine gun on that <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and shoot all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But if I think back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> of the German prisoners we took, I didn't have that feeling for some strange reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It may have been too distant or... I remember there were negotiations going on for the surrender of the Germans, and at one point it looked there was some danger because there was a whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> full of Germans as we were moving back and our company was quite exposed but the Germans wanted to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And these negotiations went on all night and I slept through the whole thing and when I woke up in the morning, most of the German officers had merely negotiated in order to be able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">That's also I remember from that episode.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  Did you talk at all about what you had just went through or did you plunge yourself into this new life? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Did anyone say, "What was it like for you to be in one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Was anybody talking to you about that at that point or did you feel a need, a desire to talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  No, actually I don't think anybody was talking about it because, of course, these Thomas Buergenthal 21 November 28, 1995 Page 21 people had come out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian concentration camp</span> , they had gone through the entire war, they knew what it was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">If people talked about anything 1t would be always to say, “Where are you from? “</span><span class="sentence" id="278">Where are your parents? “</span><span class="sentence" id="279">What did you do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="280">There I always had to be very careful because I didn't want -- first of all, I wasn't sure it was a good idea to say that I was Jewish, and second I didn't think that it was a good idea to say I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , so they just assumed that I was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And so I sort of structured my own story that I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where we had been, and that I expected to find my parents back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That was sort of the extent of that conversation, but I must say, I don't remember very much of that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It's strange; I have memories, sort of episodic memory, but not chronological memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So that I, if you say, "Well what did you do then and what did you do then," it's often that I just simply don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  Actually something you just said raises a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Did you feel Jewish and if so, how so? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I mean, had you been able to in any way affirm your identity as a Jew in this period or were you really too little to have been given that by your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  No, I felt very much that I was Jewish but it's strange, my family was not a religious family at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I had no religious education at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Religion and Judaism became part of survival for me and I think that was part of what my father, my family brought me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The Germans wanted to kill us because we were Jews and we were going to win this battle with them as Jews and we were going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so the Judaism that Thomas Buergenthal 22 November 28, 1995 Page 22 was instilled in me was the Judaism that said that we were going to win over the Germans, we're not going to let them kill us and we were going to be proud of the fact that we can survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I remember my father always saying, "We are going to be alive long after they are six feet under." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So in that sense, Judaism, the fact that we were different, was part of the thing that helped us live. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That was very strongly instilled in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But never religious, never from a religious point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But my father was very much, very strong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew, but not a religious Jew at all, neither was my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  What happens after the Polish army division pulls back from the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">What happens to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="300">What is going on at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  Well, we pull out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , eventually we are put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , again on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , end up in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedlce</span> , sort of a <span class="BUILDING">military garrison</span> where I stay, I don't know really how long, it must have been a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But one of the Jewish soldiers from that company, who knew that I was Jewish and with whom I spoke, then takes me to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Otwock</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , which shows you that I hid my Judaism one way but as far as the Jewish soldier and I were concerned, I knew that I was Jewish and he knew that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And he took me to this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> where I stayed for a good year until I found my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  Were you sad to be taken away from the <span class="BUILDING">army garrison</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Oh, in some ways, yes, because I have this sort of wonderful military life. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Yes and Thomas Buergenthal 23 November 28, 1995 Page 23 no. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I -- again, you know, the strange thing is, 1s you ask these questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Part of my life or the way I used to think was that these things happened -- and you didn't spend much time thinking about them, very little introspection about events. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You -- like, it's sort of like swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">You're downstream, this is part of what has to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It never occurred to me that I shouldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">He said it was a good idea to go to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and I went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was actually, a lot of it was quite nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="314"><span class="BUILDING">Orphanages</span> sound terrible but this one was where we were treated quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">That point is when I began to think that I would find my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Again you know, as a child there was a strong belief that I would find my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  Describe arriving at the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">What did it look like? </span><span class="sentence" id="319">What did you look like? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Were you in your little military uniform at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  You know, I should have brought a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I still have a picture of my military uniform with this Polish soldier who eventually I think went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I must have because I had nothing else, so I must have arrived that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I don't really remember the arrival part but I do remember that I was sort of -- and that made it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I was the only one there who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">All the other kids had been hidden some <span class="NPIP">place</span> or had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So I was sort of an oddity and there was a lot of people asking questions, how was this. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And the treatment was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I was still very thin and underweight and the cook in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> always made sure I would get a whole cupful or a soup bowl of cream so that I could gain Thomas Buergenthal 24 November 28, 1995 Page 24 some weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I don't think that was such a good idea in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And eggs, you know, all of the things that I don't remember having. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And of course the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was interesting because the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was divided into sort of two types of kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And, there were the real orphans, and I was considered one of the real orphans, without a mother and a father, and we were the tough kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Then there were what we considered the weaklings because they had one parent but for some reason they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And, I was the youngest of that group and was treated extremely well, had a lot of fun, played games. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And again, sort of, unthinking about what the future was going to hold and always believing without really doubting it, questioning it, that sooner or later I would find my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  When you describe yourself being in the group of the tough orphans, it sounds like when you were young, when you were ten and just coming out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , there was almost a certain amount of pride, that you had survived and that you could handle yourself in these situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Almost kind of the feelings of a young man and after all you were still a little boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  No, I think that was very true. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I think that was in part because I saw, and because of my parents, I saw the fact that I survived as a victory, that we had won over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They wanted to kill us and we made it; we didn't give them the joy of killing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So there was a tremendous sense of satisfaction, that of survival, unlike what one reads now that people supposedly feel bad that they survived and others didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We never Thomas Buergenthal 25 November 28, 1995 Page 25 had that feeling and neither did my mother because my mother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I mean we felt very bad that, for example, my father didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He died just shortly before the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But we never felt that guilty about the fact of surviving, on the contrary. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We were, it was a sense of satisfaction that we had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Really it was a sense of victory, that we didn't let them kill us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  That's an interesting thought, I'm not sure I've really heard that before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  I've never heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">All I read about is people feeling guilty that they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I mean I can understand that, I can understand it in some ways, other ways I can't understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">If you survive, honestly there's no reason you should feel guilty and we certainly didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And really the people that I know from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> never had that feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  You said that you played games at the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">What kind of games, and what was that like for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">After all you'd been working, you'd been an errand boy, you'd been a mascot to an army division. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">What was that like for you to have your day filled with eating a lot of food and playing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">You know the strange thing is when I think back, here I had my toes amputated and I played soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I played a lot of soccer, and I had the great advantage because of my amputation I could also shoot with my left foot, so I was one of the few kids who could shoot left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It -- the transition wasn't difficult at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It was an easy transition. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It would have been much harder the other way Thomas Buergenthal 26 November 28, 1995 Page 26 around. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That is, I think, an important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">That I, if you were my age, the post survival period and the adjustment and the survival period was all much easier because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I never thought like other people must have, my parents, how wonderful it was to eat a good meal or anything of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And missing all of the conveniences that one had, I couldn't take it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I've often thought that I couldn't survive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But as a child, from my point of view, things got bad but then they got so much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And, I never thought back that there was any -- it came naturally and I didn't think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  How much did people ask you about what your life had been like, for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and did you have a feeling that they were trying to find out information perhaps for later, for war crime trials or perhaps just to comfort you, to see if you'd experienced any trauma?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Well, in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , since I was the only one there who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the people from newspapers and newsreels would come, and I was sort of a minor celebrity. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Whenever people would come to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> I would be trotted out to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But not because they wanted to comfort me or anything, it was just somebody -- if they wanted to talk about the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , this was an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Actually, you probably know that there was a book written, a diary in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the man who wrote that diary and the excerpts from the diary, the parts that deal with me, he asked a lot of those questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And when he describes interviewing me in the Thomas Buergenthal 27 November 28, 1995 Page 27 <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he was struck by the fact that it was all sort of reported in the matter of fact way. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I -- it's still like this to this day, I think in part because of my age or maybe I'm just totally insensitive to the experience but not very introspective about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  You were speaking about the Norwegian Odd Nansen. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Actually he described you as a very beautiful young boy—‘pre-Raphaelite” is how he described you -- and he said that the only way he saw any anxiety was in your hands and that you had the hands of an old man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  And now I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">No -- and he described them as very nervous hands and I suppose they still are probably to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">No, he was the only one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I remember asking me about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And I was even -- I sort of thought, how strange that somebody would ask me about these things since we were all living it and there was nothing very unusual about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  And in fact, he was living it also but what struck him was that you were such a little boy and that you might have walked with a canister of gas to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Yes, of course, to me that was nothing very unusual or extraordinary, and to him it was very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He was a wonderful man and one of the few diaries written in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on a day-to-day basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I met him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I found him after the war and we stayed in touch until he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He actually saved my life in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I'm still in touch, whenever I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , his son and I get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Actually we were Thomas Buergenthal 28 November 28, 1995 Page 28 together last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  You say that often you describe things in a matter-of-fact way. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I wonder though that kind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about seeing the Russian soldiers and the German soldiers and you must have seen many bodies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Is that something that became matter of fact for you also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Without necessarily saying that it was matter-of-fact in a way that you just don't notice it. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">It was -- the death and seeing death in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and seeing people dying could not but affect one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But again as part of the self-defense mechanism, you tried not to think about it, you tried not to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Although, you know, it's strange, I can talk about my experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I can write about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I can't see movies about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I can't read. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">A lot of things they affect me tremendously, increasingly so. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I think in part because I must have sort of suppressed a lot of things that come out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But I'm struck by the fact how much more, how difficult certain things are for me today than they were even 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I, when I just even see a snippet of a movie, say Schindler's List, they would show something on television, I would break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Despite the fact that I give the impression that nothing phases me, that I just simply can't take. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">For example certain Jewish music, religious music, brings back memories of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that are very difficult for me, for example, a ceremony at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , to stay without breaking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Thomas Buergenthal 29 November 28, 1995 Page 29 Thomas Buergenthal 30 November 28, 1995 Page 30 Tape 2, Side A
QUESTION:  Have you ever been to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Well, actually I've not been able. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I haven't had the courage to walk through. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I've been there, I've given a talk, I've been in the <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , but I haven't been able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I probably will one of these days and I want to take my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But I just, I don't have the courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It took me, well I didn't go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> until '92, first time I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Actually, it worked out it was much easier than I thought it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was much harder going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> where I had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I'll have to go the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , obviously, but I'm afraid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">That's the same, I haven't been in the Yad Vashem even though I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I could have gone, emotionally I'm just afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Can you tell us what it was like to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , that is, where you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and then there was the massacre? </span><span class="sentence" id="421">That was where you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then there was the massacre that you survived there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Well, the strange thing is that what we did, my wife and I, decided to sort of go back to my roots and we actually went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born and we drove around. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And she would record, she would ask me questions and I would tell her about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">As we were driving into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , I suddenly remembered the address of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="DLF">street</span> where we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I hadn't remembered it for Thomas Buergenthal 31 November 28, 1995 Page 31 years, I couldn't remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It suddenly came back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And we drove into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and I sort of directed her, and I'm a person who gets lost any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I get lost in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, DC</span> , if I don't see the Washington monument and here I sort of directed her within two blocks of where we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and found the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The interesting thing is -- you know how children are -- I kept telling her, "It's this big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I don't know, it must be six or seven stories high." </span><span class="sentence" id="430">When we got to it, it was a three-story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was just as dilapidated, just as terrible as it was when I remembered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And the faces of the people, there was a tremendous amount of antisemitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> particularly it was quite bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We were always afraid that if you tried to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you would be handed over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The faces of the people and the lack of the fact that there was no monument any place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to say this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">All I could think about was, I want to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I just couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Thinking that my parents lived in this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">My mother had just died and I couldn't wait to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It was lunchtime and we were going to stop and have lunch, I said, "I don't want to do anything, I just want to get out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I'd spent four years of my life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But it was exactly, I mean the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that whole <span class="REGION">area</span> -- and the lack of any remembering, any effort made to remember that 20,000 people had lived here who had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I did go -- we did go to a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We tried to find a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and I asked for a book on the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> ; eventually they found Thomas Buergenthal 32 November 28, 1995 Page 32 something that had been issued, there had been some exhibit I don't know how long ago, but there was nothing in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that you could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">This was the city museum of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and there was nothing about the wartime experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">A book that I eventually got -- it's sort of small little book about the Jewish community which must have been issued during the Communist period. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was shocking to me, well, first the way that nothing had changed, but then it was sort of totally, it's as if all of this that had happened there had no impact on the people and they didn't even want to remember it, whereas it was quite different in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I had come in, we went first. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in the nice camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so we went in there first. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I was very concerned how it would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">As we walked in we saw a sign that said, “ARCHIVES,” and my wife said, "Why don't you go in and introduce yourself?" </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I was at this point thinking I should be writing down my experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I said, "No, I want to be a tourist, I don't want to bother with any of that." </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And she insisted, so she usually prevails. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I went in, introduced myself, and they took me to the director and he then introduced me to the archivist, and they were a whole group of people who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They were at that point actually working on a study on children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So they wanted to know, where were you and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And then I had them check my number and find out when I arrived, and they had all of the -- they had the document, they knew the number of people that came with my transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Thomas Buergenthal 33 November 28, 1995 Page 33
QUESTION:  This was -- you're talking about the tattoo that you got when you did arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And what happened then as a result of this activity, the whole thing for me became an academic exercise, so then we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they put a guide at my disposal and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , but it was no longer the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So the transition was made much easier because of all these questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  I want to go back to the point where you are in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Tell us how you were reconnected with your mother and any details that you know that were told to you in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">How was the tracing actually done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  That's a wonderful story because my mother believed that I was alive when everybody told her that it couldn't be, but she believed it and she insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Matter of fact, my mother walked back -- she was liberated not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> -- she walked back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There were people who had -- because she and my father had sort of different <span class="BUILDING">weigh stations</span> where they were going to meet after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And people there had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with me and some people had seen me at this point or at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They all told her, "He can't be alive, forget it," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">She insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Well, my uncle, who lived here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- my mother then went back to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">She was sort of three months drugged just to sleep it all off, and got in touch with my uncle and they started the search and so the Jewish agency for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and Thomas Buergenthal 34 November 28, 1995 Page 34 various search bureaus of Red Cross and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">In the meantime, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was run by Jewish Communists, so-called the Bund party, who wanted Jews to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and become good Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> had been infiltrated by a Zionist organization and one of our counselors was a young woman, a Zionist woman from the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za’ir movement, which is a Zionist labor movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And they decided that those of us who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> then -- this was in 1946 -- we should run away from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and we would be picked up by the people from that group and then taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and then eventually be shipped illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And so, the procedure was that every week or so, one kid who wanted to go there would run away from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and would disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But we all who wanted to go, put our names, tell them that we wanted to run away, so they made a list with our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">But I was told that since I had been on newsreels, that if I ran away that would really draw attention to the whole thing, so I had to be the last one to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But the list with names was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and it was sent to the Jewish agency in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and somebody in the Jewish agency looked at those lists - this 1s pre-computers, imagine -- 1t was written in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> -- saw a mother looking for her child and a child with the same name on another list. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Notified my uncle in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and then my mother and then eventually they -- an American organization smuggled me out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> Thomas Buergenthal 35 November 28, 1995 Page 35 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then to the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where my mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">That was in December of 1946, so imagine, I was separated from my mother in 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Do you remember the moment that someone came and told you, "Your mother's alive, she's in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we are going to take you to her?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  Well, that was actually very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I received a letter in Polish supposedly from my mother, written in handwriting, curious enough I could not really read, but I knew my mother's handwriting, and I knew that my mother didn't write Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And I thought it was a trick because every so often people tried to adopt us from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> so this letter came supposedly from my mother, delighted that she found me and she was going to get me out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I was sure that wasn't my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It wasn't until I received a letter from my mother in German that I knew it was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">You see, we couldn't talk on the telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">None of that existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  So it was your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  It was my mother but she had somebody else write the letter in Polish thinking that I had forgotten my German or since it was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  And what did that letter say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Well, I really don't remember what it said. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I wish I had kept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Actually the letter was written by a man who was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with us who later became my mother's second husband, a wonderful man, a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The only surviving doctor from -- who then died unfortunately in '48. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But he wrote that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I knew my mother couldn't Thomas Buergenthal 36 November 28, 1995 Page 36 write Polish and we were always, you know, this adoption thing, this is the tough kids in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> didn't want to be adopted. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It really didn't dawn on me until months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  So the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> said, "Fine, his mother is alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And now I'd like to know a little more detail about getting smuggled out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and into -- again it seemingly this should have been easy for you to be reunited with your mother but here you are again in these dangerous situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  Well, nothing was easy after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I had no papers for one thing, no passports -- you would have had to have visas and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was very cooperative and the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was also supported by Jewish organizations from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , particularly the American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So they, sort of through my uncle, started beginning to move this reunion and how to get me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">What happened was that somebody came and said that they were going to take me to my mother and the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I suppose they investigated it, and I went with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We had to be smuggled out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , this was in the winter, this was end of November, December 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We crossed over the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it was freezing and I was very affected because of my frostbite. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We had to walk across the Czech/<span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , they had bribed the guards, it wasn't dangerous but it was still a sort of, 1t was an illegal operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I then ended up, I was picked up by an American woman working for one of these organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , Thomas Buergenthal 37 November 28, 1995 Page 37 taken to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I had never been in -- what I remember from this, it's funny how these things stay in your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">It was a <span class="DLF">revolving door</span> and I didn't know how to get into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I was just standing there worrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">She walked through the <span class="DLF">revolving door</span> and I was supposed to follow her and here I stood, I didn't know how to -- after all this, the <span class="DLF">revolving door</span> was something I had never seen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Well, we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for a few days and then again we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- there was another group of border smugglers from a Jewish organization called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brichah</span> which took us from the <span class="REGION">Czech side</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hirth</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> ; it was the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Again, trudging through <span class="DLF">border</span> , walking across with bribed border guards, and ending up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and eventually going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military train</span> with her from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , crossing into the British zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my mother awaiting me -- not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , she couldn't wait -- in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Well -- and then you know, then I just couldn't believe it at that point, that's when the realization set in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  So, resume, how did your mother recognize you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  I don't know how she recognized me, but I recognized her immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We had only been separated three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">That was no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  Do you remember some of the first things you talked about in those first few moments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Not really, I think it was so overwhelming, you know a lot of crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">The usual Thomas Buergenthal 38 November 28, 1995 Page 38 thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  So then your mother took you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Had you ever been to where she was living before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  No, because actually, even though my grandparent's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> still stood, my grandparent's were forced to sell it and my mother lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and life suddenly became normal after all of those years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  And, in a sense, it hadn't been that long since you hadn't seen your mother but in another sense you had become essentially a man who figured out how to make his way in the middle of this war. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">How did she react to that? </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You must have been very independent by that point, not her little boy anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  I don't know whether that's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I reverted to being her little boy in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But it's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all of this -- and I had a year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher, and he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense and a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the same with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of reminiscing about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you know -- where was this, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">But I was a child, I played, I did everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 -- how old was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">14, 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I couldn't speak German too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Again, this was sort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had Thomas Buergenthal 39 November 28, 1995 Page 39 spoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be fluent again in German even though at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we used to speak German and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I spoke German with my mother and father when we were together and Polish with my father when we were alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  And so there was a kind of -- let's catch up and what happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Where you did sort of sit down and just really debrief with each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another thing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The truth of the matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that happened that were funny, about this or that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So the human spirit -- you couldn't take all this if 1t were only reminiscences about all the terrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So my wife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother and I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often and remember this funny thing, and remember this. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It wasn't only remembering the terrible things that had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I imagine it was probably when I was little we talked more about those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  Because after all life does happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  At that point what did you know about the fate of your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Was it still a mystery, Thomas Buergenthal 40 November 28, 1995 Page 40 and if you did know anything, how did you know it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  No, at that point my mother already knew that my father had not survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">It's strange because I had always believed that my father would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It's strange, my mother was not well, my mother had thyroid condition so I assumed that if one or the other of them was going to survive it was going to be my father who was going to survive because he was also, he was very strong and very healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But he was executed three days before the war supposedly ended, in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , where they executed a lot of people just before the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  So that was a situation where perhaps the Germans were going to surrender or leave and they just emptied out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> by killing people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  I understand that he was in the group, there were orders given apparently to not let any of the prisoners -- most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> fall into -- be liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And where he was the order was executed, in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  How did you find that out? </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Did people tell you that who were there or did you research it later in life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  No, I didn't find it out, my mother at that point already knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  So was there a point -- then finally you knew about your father -- where you stepped back and took a sort of time to mourn him in any way, you and your mother together? </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I'm not sure how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  You know it's strange but life was so unordinary if you want, that you didn't mourn Thomas Buergenthal 41 November 28, 1995 Page 41 in the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It was a loss, you know, we lost so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It was a terrible thing that my father hadn't survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was something that I still feel today but mourning wasn't something one did in the way one does for example, if somebody dies and one goes through this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It was a reality one simply accepted, added to all the other things that had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But one didn't mourn the way we do in ordinary, everyday life. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">That simply didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I'm sure when my mother first found out, it must have been extremely difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But by the time I was reunited with my mother I think I -- I don't know when or if ever, on the one hand I always believed I was going to find my parents, but at the same time I must have at some point in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> already concluded that I wouldn't be reunited, that neither of them lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  When you think back to when you finally got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and you're with your mother, those first few days, and you're looking around and all of a sudden your life is beginning to look a little more normal, do you, I mean, was there one moment when you sort of remember looking around, maybe going to a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> with your mother and saying, "Okay, this is pretty normal, my life is normal now?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  No, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I think I assumed that my life had been normal from the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">The fact that 1t wasn't normal was part of it being normal, this was all part of the life that I had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I mean you would think that going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for example, would be difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It was very difficult initially for my Thomas Buergenthal 42 November 28, 1995 Page 42 mother but this was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> she really could go back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">My mother always told the story with a very bad conscious, very guilty, because she was standing on the street corner in her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and an old lady came up to her and asked her to help her across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and my mother said, "Nobody helped my mother across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="584">This was right after she came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Then for years she would talk about 1t and say how terrible it was that she had acted that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So you know, we had all of those feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But then I went there to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> initially but at first the thought to go with these kids whose fathers had killed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But then you realize that these are people you don't know whether they killed your father, most of them probably didn't, and you make friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And you find for example, we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with somebody, who was, a Catholic family that had actually helped the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , had been in danger themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And so that sort of abstract hatred becomes transformed into the fact that they're human beings regardless of whether they're Germans or not Germans and not every German was guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  When you first got there and you had to brush up on your German and you had a German tutor, how did you feel about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I mean you were after all learning this language that you must, at that point, you might have associated with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and kind of negative things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  But remember, it was also the language of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I've never made that association. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I always had terrible trouble seeing Germans in uniform but not the Thomas Buergenthal 43 November 28, 1995 Page 43 language. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And it wasn't a problem then. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But of course the difficulty was that one did sometimes see types on the <span class="DLF">street</span> that reminded one of the SS and others, so they probably were. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">My mother would every so often look at some woman walking by and say that she must have been a camp guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And you know, those memories would invariably come back or people would make some remarks or people would see her number. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">She always wore short sleeves and people would say to her, "Don't you think you should have this tattoo removed?" </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And she would say, "This is a badge of honor, I would never remove this." </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You know, and she had a lot of the -- [end of side one of tape 2] Tape 2, Side B- lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , starting I think in 1953 until she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Every so often if she would see a German tour guide, she would make some sort of remark but at the same time she was very forgiving in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Did you ever consider removing your tatoo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But I think it's, it's -- and nobody told me to, that 1t would be a good idea if I removed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But I think you'd tell it to -- she was a very pretty woman and so I suppose it was a natural thing to say, "Shouldn't you remove it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But no, she was very wonderful, she was a very little person. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">She was less than five feet tall, very Thomas Buergenthal 44 November 28, 1995 Page 44 charming but very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I mean, the fact that she could survive that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And she actually survived Mengele® who looked at her in the selection process and said to her, "You have a thyroid condition" because her eyes would show. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And she in her wonderful north German looked at her and said, "Doctor, you're a magnificent diagnostician." </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And he let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You know that's kind of sort of --
QUESTION:  When you were beginning to integrate yourself into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> , how open were you about being Jewish, about being a survivor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and was it something that people talked about or were people saying, "Some of that's exaggeration, it didn't really happen"? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">What was going on then in terms of your experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  First of all, we were very proud of being Jews and being survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And of course you know, my mother's family was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">This was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , this is a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> , it had 50,000 inhabitants but my mother grew up in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were known. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was the only Jewish child in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the German kids would sometimes look at me and say, "You don't look the ways Jews are supposed to look" because their only notion of Jews were these cartoons that they had seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The kids, you know children are children. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I never experienced any antisemitism in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , never had any sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I've experienced antisemitism more in many other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but never in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">People said they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The only > Josef Mengele (1911-19792), Extermination camp doctor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Thomas Buergenthal 45 November 28, 1995 Page 45 incident really that I remember in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was, of course, the teachers tried to avoid speaking about the war altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">It was never mentioned in history class. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">History was taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">You spoke about the German mythology and the 17th, 18th century but never about the 20th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">That was never taken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But in one class, I don't know whether it was even a history class, but the issue came up of the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and the teacher was saying how terrible that was and I raised my hand and I said, "Well, if you're going to talk about that, why don't you also talk about all the other terrible things that you people did," and all <span class="NPIP">hell</span> broke loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The teacher got very huffy initially and then, of course, worried because this was right after the war and they had to go through denazification and all of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Then he came at some point to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and apologized. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But that was the only incident which this matter ever came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Of course, they tried to never talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The kids would sometimes ask, ““What's this number?” </span><span class="sentence" id="636">and “How bad was it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Because these are kids my age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  What would you tell them, would you be honest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, I would tell them this is what happened, and then they would tell me that their father was -- you know, some of the kids' fathers were prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But it was curiosity more than, but I never had the sense of any sort of antisemitic feeling or any sense of, "Oh, it's a pity that you weren't..." You know, the usual thing that one expects 1s, "How come you survived and why did you survive, what a pity that Thomas Buergenthal 46 November 28, 1995 Page 46 you..." None of that ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Did you ever have any fear that if you were very open about who you were about as a Jew, or confronted any authority, that somehow the rug could get pulled out from under you again, that you could be persecuted for being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  No, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You know the strange thing is that when you enter a class, I learned very early because I learned it in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , too; in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , I was the kid who was sent to get the mail from the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , this was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Because a lot of kids, the Poles would throw stones at and attack them and yell antisemitic slogans at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I would go and pick up the mail and nobody would yell at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">For one thing I didn't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">But I remember once confronting somebody and who said something about me and the first reaction was to just slug him, and I learned very early that with all of that, the best way was to just be extremely aggressive and if somebody said something like this, you just whopped them one but you didn't act as if you were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And that was also very effective in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when you enter the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I was quite strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And so you took on, not because of antisemitism or anything else, but when you came into a new environment you had to assert yourself and so you took on the fellow who was supposed to be the strongest. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And I remember I was very good in arm wrestling and I could beat anybody so we would prove ourselves, you know the usual, almost like monkeys assert their superiority. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But I never had any problems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I had to prove myself like I imagine any Thomas Buergenthal 47 November 28, 1995 Page 47 other kid has to prove himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  So you had gotten strong now, you grew strong again, healthy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  Yes, I was extremely healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Quite athletic. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I did, I played soccer in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I boxed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I ran -- I actually won the 100-meter championship with my amputated toes, which nobody knew about. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So it -- and I loved sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">It was all of the things that Germans to be able to do was another part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Did your mother have a strategy for keeping you healthy in terms of cooking? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Was it a kind of concentrated effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  No, I never had the sense that -- she let me do, eat what I wanted and at that point in the beginning it wasn't always easy to get food after the war but we always had relatively good food. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Of course, any food we would have had was good from my point of view at the time but I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">We received some care packages actually from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and my relatives here sent some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It was always a big event when a package arrived from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with different things coming out of cans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  How did your mother earn money? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">What was she doing at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Well, my mother wasn't doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">At that point we -- she -- received a pension. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Initially we received -- there was actually aid given to Jewish, from Jewish organizations and at one point she was the president of the Jewish community which consisted, I think, of about 20 Jewish, Jews’ families and individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And there was Thomas Buergenthal 48 November 28, 1995 Page 48 food brought and distributed, and we—she -- received after my father, which later on was increased and she could actually live quite well on that pension. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And we traded, you know, we used to trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">If you got a pack of cigarettes from the <span class="COUNTRY">Unites States</span> you could trade that and you could live for a week on the food that you could trade with the farmers that would come in for coffee or cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Right after the war until 1948 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if you got any cigarettes and coffee from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it was a wonderful way to obtain good food from the farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  Were there any military Allied troops at all in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or did you have any sense of a military presence there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  Yes, there were English troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">As a matter of fact, it's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The -- a current British member of parliament -- a Jewish member of parliament, a man by the name of Janner,° whose father is already represented the Jewish, the east side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in the British parliament -- was a young soldier and came to visit us and the befriended us and I stayed in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He took me to movies and brought us some food, but there was a British occupation troop there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  How did they know you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  They apparently asked for somebody, whether there was any Jewish community and Jewish families, and he made a point of finding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And that happened often. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">People, if there were Jewish soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they would try to find whether there were Thomas Buergenthal 49 November 28, 1995 Page 49 Jewish families and whether they needed anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  How aware of you -- were you -- of the rest of the sort of post-war period? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Were you for instance following the Nuremberg trial and were you aware of Albert Speer?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Was that something you were following or were you --
ANSWER:  Well, it's interesting you should ask that because I remember the Nuremberg trials only to the extent that I remember the first, almost first English words that I remember was "by hanging," and I remember listening to the radio when they announced the sentences and we were listening to that with sort of joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">But that's the only thing that I remember of that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">But I should tell you a story that is interesting connected with occupation forces because we mentioned Mr. Nansen who had written a diary, then a book about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I forgot his name when I was liberated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I couldn't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But when I came back to my mother I kept saying, "There was this wonderful man, this Norwegian who had saved my life and was very nice to me, and his father was very famous and his father's pictures were on even the packages of cookies that he once gave me." </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And my mother said, "He must have been some famous cookie manufacturer." </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So you know, it was just sort of the way you would treat a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I kept saying, "No, no, this man..." Then, one day in 1948, my mother was reading a newspaper that was for ° Janner, Barnett, Lord (1892-), British communal and Zionist leader. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Speer, Albert (1905-1981); Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production, Thomas Buergenthal 50 November 28, 1995 Page 50 former inmates in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was a little write-up of a book that had just been published, the diaries of a man, a Norwegian, who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> so my mother said to me "That might be your cookie -- he might know who that man was. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Why don't we write to him and find out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So we wrote this letter to him asking whether he might know the man who was so nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And of course the mail was terrible in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Nothing happened for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Then one day the doorbell rings and there's a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Norwegian military truck</span> outside and the girl who opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> said, "Yes?" </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He said, "Well, we have a package here for the Buergenthal family. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So she said, "Give it to me," and they said, "No, no, no, it's much too heavy, we have to take it in." </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So they take a tremendous crate and they bring it up and it's food collected from Norwegian children with a letter from him saying that he's the person and, you know, how delighted he was that I'm alive because he thought that I had died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> as a result that's why the book was dedicated to me, among others, because he thought that I hadn't survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Then eventually he came and he actually took me to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> to spend six weeks in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , and had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But it was, when he learned that I was alive, he announced it in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and so the school children began to collect food. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And apparently they collected, there was a lot of chocolate which was rationed at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , so it was quite a sacrifice for Norwegian children to give up their chocolate rations so I could have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The Hitler’s chief architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Thomas Buergenthal 51 November 28, 1995 Page 51 Scandinavians were just wonderful in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  At this point is your life beginning to be normal? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">You were about 13, 14, 15, but were you ever having nightmares at anything or at that point did you have memories that plagued you, I suppose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  I used to have nightmares for a while in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but then I found a wonderful way to solve, deal with my nightmares and I never had them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Never had them as nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I had this recurring dream that I was being executed and then in one nightmare when I looked into the barrel of the gun, some flower or grass came out of it and they weren't real bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So every time this nightmare recurred, I had, saw that as nothing to worry about because no bullets are going to come out of this gun and the nightmares were never a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  Were you comfortable in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I knew that I wanted to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I mean, I wasn't uncomfortable in the sense that I didn't feel that I wasn't well-treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">But I felt I really didn't belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I felt that sooner or later I would leave and the only question was whether I would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else and I actually planned to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Then I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Actually I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> really for only one year and never went back but I didn't think I would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">It was sort of clear to me even before I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that I really didn't fit in somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Not because I had been made uncomfortable in any way, and this was probably the reason too why my Thomas Buergenthal 52 November 28, 1995 Page 52 mother left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  When you began to have those thoughts, what was your mother saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">What were her feelings about being separated again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Well, my mother just thought that I would go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for a year and stay with my uncle and come back and she thought that it was a good experience that I should go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was what we imagined, it was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> and you had to see it, it was wonderful, but she didn't think that I would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">It was hard for her when I didn't, but I tried to come back as often as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But I think she recognized that it was the best thing for me to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  Tell us about your uncle, his name first of all, and how you first came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">How did you actually get here? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Did you come on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> or did you fly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  No, I came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Liberty boat</span> , the SS Greeley (ph), SS General Greeley (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It was one of these, you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tubs</span> that were built for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">It was a long trip, I think we were at least a week if not longer on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , with a large number of refugees; it was immigrants coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">All nationalities, all languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Well, what can I tell you about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It was actually quite an interesting trip because I realized again the survival instinct that we talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">People had to work on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , people had to paint and sweep. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">At that point I was 17 and I realized that wasn't really the nice thing to have to do and I volunteered to be an interpreter, so I would have to go and make the announcements in different languages over the Thomas Buergenthal 53 November 28, 1995 Page 53 public address system. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">In that capacity we had a lovely <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay and we actually published a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I still have the newspaper that we published on the last day on the arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">It was a very wonderful group of people from all over including a Kalnick (ph) family from the steppes of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I still have some pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Then I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">For some reason my uncle couldn't pick me up, he wasn't allowed to pick me up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> but I was picked up by a Jewish welfare service organization who took me to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , like a sort of halfway house in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> where I stayed a week before my uncle picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The very funny thing that happened there, I arrived there and there were other kids in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they of course were natives already, they'd been here a few weeks and knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They took me, they said, "You want to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="752">You want to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Of course I wanted to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened up and they got out at one <span class="NPIP">stop</span> and I didn't make it out and I had no idea where I was because I had no address, but we got reunited at the next stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But my uncle and my aunt are wonderful people, they're still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">My uncle and aunt came, their names are Sylberg, Eric and Senta Sylburg (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="757">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paterson</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">They came in 1938 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">They worked in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , one daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They're now in their 80s but still doing very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And they took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They weren't wealthy people at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I lived with them for a year and a half while I went to Thomas Buergenthal 54 November 28, 1995 Page 54 high school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paterson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were sort of my surrogate parents for many years, until I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  Did you speak any English at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Yes, well, I spoke some English, I had <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> German, <span class="BUILDING">German high school</span> English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  What were your other languages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  Well I had Polish, German, and French, which I've basically lost on learning Spanish; it's very difficult for me now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  And just to clarify, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that you came over on, this was formerly a group of refugees who were given permission to come over and you came as a group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Well, what happened was this: there was a sort of -- instead of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> they had established a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the U.S. authorities had established a camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where people who had different visas to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as refugees were first brought into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> their papers were examined. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And then every few weeks they would have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ready and they would take people over on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refugee ship</span> , and that was one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">QUESTION:  What was your first view of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , literally? </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Was it of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> and the Statue of Liberty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  No, but it was of the Statue of Liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Because we arrived -- it was really wonderful- we arrived in the late afternoon and so we couldn't disembark until the next Thomas Buergenthal 55 November 28, 1995 Page 55 morning and so we could see the Statue of Liberty all lit up. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">As a matter of fact in the newspaper article that each of us wrote in a different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I wrote mine in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I noted the lights of the Statue of Liberty and the lights of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , which made a tremendous impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I reflected on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> and the light. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So it was a tremendous moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  So you did flashback on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I reread it the other day and I was struck by how much I -- these flashbacks come to me, for example they came to me in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , they come all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">One really can't have gone through that experience and when you see something similar, that brings it back, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It doesn't bring it back necessarily in a negative way. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But I saw it in connection with the El Mozote massacre in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> or the killing of the Jesuits. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">These things came right back to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  What did you decide to study when you went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">As we've pointed out before, you went to <span class="BUILDING">Bethany college</span> in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> on a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">When did your interests begin to take shape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  Well, it's strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Initially I thought I wanted to be a journalist but then I decided very early that I wouldn't make much of a journalist in the language that wasn't my language. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">When I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> , I already, I think the first year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> I already decided I was going to be a lawyer and I was going to do something relating to international things, I didn't have it very clear in my mind and I actually was a Thomas Buergenthal 56 November 28, 1995 Page 56 pre-law student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">My father was a lawyer so it was sort of an easy -- at one point I thought of studying medicine but then I realized again that I didn't have the science ability or background. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">But it's really the lawyer thing was already, actually when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paterson</span> I had already decided that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  And as you started to study the law, how did your interest in it take shape? </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Did you ever at one point think you might be a trial lawyer or some other type of lawyer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  No, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I always thought I wanted to do something with law and international relations of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But you know, in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> -- at least in your first years in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , at least in the days that I went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> -- you couldn't even get a course in international law in your first or second year. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">It was usually you got electives only in the third year so I had my first international law course in my third year of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">It wasn't until I went onto graduate law that I specialized and could specialize in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">But I always -- at that point when I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> I'd made up my mind I would do something in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Tape 3, Side A
QUESTION:  Where we are is, I want to go back with a couple questions about <span class="BUILDING">college</span> as we're moving into your choice of law as a career. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">What were you drawn to in terms of what you wanted to study in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="808">What kinds of things were you finding Thomas Buergenthal 57 November 28, 1995 Page 57 yourself interested in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> I was very much interested in history, particularly American history. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">That fascination sort of came out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I had a very fine <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> history course, and then political science, international relations was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And literature -- I actually majored -- I minored in English in college of all things. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Then in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> I wanted to study international things but I really had only one course as I mentioned before, then I decided to go on to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I did my <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> and I went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> for a masters and eventually for a doctorate in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">What was interesting, struck me, I reread my application to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> what I wanted to do, and in my application I said that I wanted to study <span class="BUILDING">international courts</span> among other things, and then I ended up serving 12 years on an <span class="BUILDING">international court</span> without knowing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">It was sort of a strange thing, but that's what I wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But I did work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> on international organizations I was particularly interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">The <span class="BUILDING">European common market</span> was just beginning and I was interested in how that <span class="BUILDING">court</span> functioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Then I did my doctorate actually on a subject that everybody is surprised out, I did it on international air law. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">But in between I got very much interested in human rights and I wrote one of my first articles on human rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  What was appealing to you about the law? </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I mean when you actually started to sink your teeth into it and you're studying it every day and verbally, I suppose, debating Thomas Buergenthal 58 November 28, 1995 Page 58 it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">What were your reactions to it? </span><span class="sentence" id="823">What did you like about it, what did you dislike about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  Well, if we're just talking <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in general, I disliked almost everything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I just hated my first year in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I thought it was much too technical and very lacking in -- at least the way it was taught in those days -- very little policy orientation and there was sort of various technical, dry case analysis that didn't, to my mind at the time, didn't focus on what I thought were important issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">It wasn't really until I was able to study what I was really interested in, which was international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I got interested, I began to enjoy law really in my third year in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , and then international law because I saw it as an instrument of being able to deal with some of the problems that I had myself experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And I wanted to see to what extent law could play a role in preventing some of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I'm not saying this in any sort of philosophical sense, but I thought I had a background in, a language background and was sort of naturally drawn to things international. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I therefore thought it would be interesting to see to what extent various organizations like the UN, the European Common Market, the Council of Europe; to what extent they're doing something that in fact might prevent the reoccurrence of the things that I had experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And once I got into it, that was the thing that really captivated me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  What was the atmosphere at that time -- the sort of attitude about international law -- Thomas Buergenthal 59 November 28, 1995 Page 59 was there a feeling that it was an effective tool, or when you were studying it was there a different feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">ANSWER:  Well, it depends a little bit where -- when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> I had some wonderful professors of international law, probably among the best in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And they demonstrated the importance of it and sort of opened a completely new different world for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">But of course, all the people around us, that is to say not in the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> but the world around us believed that all of this really didn't exist, that there was no such thing as international law and that it was totally irrelevant. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And so you always had the sense that you were sort of an academic who was studying something that had no relevance to anything that happened in the real world. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I never believed this, I always thought that 1t was much more relevant than people thought, than the average person thought, and much more relevant than most Americans thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I thought Americans probably had a much less of an understanding of the importance of international law than people in other parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And less of a realization of the importance of the UN for example and the significance of it than people in other parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So it was sort of almost a schizophrenic aspect when you were studying international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">You'd go to a cocktail party and people would say, "Well, what are you studying?" </span><span class="sentence" id="843">You'd say, "International law," and they'd say, "Does it really exist?" </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Then when I started teaching, you'd get the same, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">But what I was able to do and throughout my life, my professional life, is that I never Thomas Buergenthal 60 November 28, 1995 Page 60 just did, I was never just an academic, that I wrote and taught international law, particularly human rights and international organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But starting in the early 70s I really worked -- in the 70s I began to represent the U.S. Government at UNESCO in human rights matters, then I ended up on the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights where we dealt with some very nasty cases like disappearances and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And now I'm on the UN Human Rights Committee, and we're doing the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I was on the Truth Commission of <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , all the time while continuing to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So that, to me, international law was never just an academic subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I also - | have lived it almost all of the years since I began teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I've also practiced it in a way, not in as a law firm lawyer but as a international lawyer working in the <span class="DLF">field</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  When would you say you began to develop a philosophy of human rights law and that you saw that emerge in your ideals in the kinds of choices you were making and the cases you were bringing? </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And what is your philosophy, I suppose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">ANSWER:  Well you know, I've never brought a human rights case. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I've always thought that I could be much more effective in the <span class="REGION">human rights area</span> by not being an activist in the sense of being a lawyer filing cases, but an academic who could be perceived to have a legitimacy when he spoke on human rights issue that wasn't driven by political considerations. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It wasn't driven by other considerations and that had no political agenda other than concern for human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And that has been enabled me, * United Nations Educational and Cultural Organizations Thomas Buergenthal 61 November 28, 1995 Page 61 in fact, to be on a <span class="BUILDING">human rights court</span> and be put in positions of being able, I think, to do a great deal in the <span class="REGION">human rights area</span> , and to be taken seriously in the <span class="REGION">human rights area</span> without being viewed as somebody who has a political agenda. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I think it's very important for NGOs’ and activist organizations to do the work that they're doing, but it's also important for people to be seen as committed to human rights and committed to the advancement of human rights who aren't political activists in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And I've always thought that I could do much more by doing that, by staying above the sort of political foray, and that was particularly important in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , where from the beginning if you spoke about human rights you were perceived to be a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">As a matter of fact, I founded the InterAmerican Institute of Human Rights in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> , precisely in order to legitimate just a discussion of human rights, which when I first came I was involved with <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> in the late 70s, the discussion of human rights wasn't a legitimate subject, it just became aggressive political discourse between the right and the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And so my sense has always been that some of us, at any rate, can contribute much more through teaching and through serving as impartial arbiters in this <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">In the <span class="REGION">teaching area</span> , I -- my former professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and I -- did the first American case book in international human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">We established the teaching of international human rights in the <span class="BUILDING">American law schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And our book came out in 1977 and ? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">National Governing Organizations Thomas Buergenthal 62 November 28, 1995 Page 62 before then only three of us taught the subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">It's now taught in almost all <span class="BUILDING">American law schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And, you know, I have a little book for students on the teaching of -- on international human rights, which actually the subject has suddenly taken on a life of it's own not only in <span class="BUILDING">law schools</span> but every <span class="NPIP">place</span> else, which it didn't have when I first started in this <span class="DLF">field</span> in the late 60s. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Nobody was interested in this <span class="DLF">field</span> and in the international -- the American Society of International -- didn't even consider human rights to be a subject of international -- so I worked in both of these <span class="REGION">areas</span> and I thought it was always very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Philosophy -- that's the philosophy I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">To my mind the most important thing in this <span class="DLF">field</span> is not to let yourself be politicized; that's the biggest danger that I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">People who promote human rights, when they politicize the subject, do a great deal of harm to the victims because they then debilitate themselves in being able to protect victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Also I've learned a great deal of patience in this <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It takes a few lifetimes to be able to achieve anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But, you know, the most gratifying thing is to -- it's often occurred to me when I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zepuan</span> (ph) sitting on the case or when investigating human rights violations in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> or now at the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span> -- to think that somebody who had survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is given the opportunity to be working in this <span class="DLF">field</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It's a wonderful -- it's a gift, it's a blessing when you think about it, you know, that I've been given this opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">It's exciting and that's what sort of makes this all for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Every time I sit on something that sort of brings back the memory, it seems to me to Thomas Buergenthal 63 November 28, 1995 Page 63 say that it's almost as if there was something written that I'm supposed to be doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The irony, the poetic justice of my doing this, comes back so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">It came back particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> where so many things that I saw reminded me of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , from the massacres to the executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">But to think, you know, to think of the cold Polish winters and the tropics of <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , yet the same cruelty, and for me to be able to be involved in this, it boggles the mind in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  I'm not sure most people would make that connection unless they had your experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , that there was a kind of similar, I guess, brutality going on between treatment of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and what happened during the worst of the civil war in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  Well, you know, it struck me long ago when I read Solzhenitsyn! </span><span class="sentence" id="883">books about the gulag, that the unimaginative cruelty, it's always the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">You know, when you read what happened in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gulags</span> , you say, "Gee, this is exactly what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And then in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> for example, when the only survivor there described the massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">When she began talking, I could have finished the story for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I was struck by the fact that I could have continued about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">It's the same, I mean this brutality and the same thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">There is no -- evil has sort of a monotone to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I don't know, that is the thing that always strikes me, that I just can't get over. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Thomas Buergenthal 64 November 28, 1995 Page 64
QUESTION:  How do you think your personal experiences shape -- how do you think your personal experiences shape what you actually decide to do in certain situations with a case? </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Perhaps when you're sitting on a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> -- or maybe the link is not that direct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  The link is probably there and it's not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">In other words, it doesn't and it shouldn't shape the outcome of the decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">What it does, it's you have a much better sense of the reality in which an event happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">It's as if, you know, if I were a judge sitting on a commercial case and I'd been prior to that a lawyer practicing in the <span class="REGION">commercial law area</span> , I would have a much better sense of dealing with this material than somebody who came out of some other environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Well, it's a little the same for me when I deal with a human rights case. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">This is a reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">When I hear somebody describe a certain situation, there is an understanding of what could have happened and also doubts raise when somebody tells you something, you say whenever that doesn't sound right. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And you can make those, you can have those doubts only if you've lived through something similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So to that extent there is a connection, and to that extent it's very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">But it shouldn't affect your decision- making process. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But of course, there is the empathy that comes out of the experience, is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And I think people shouldn't be in human rights if they don't have some empathy for what it is to be subjected to violations. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">But I don't know, sometimes you wonder and you say to yourself, you know, something at the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span> ' Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr Isayevich (1918-), author. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Thomas Buergenthal 65 November 28, 1995 Page 65 now where it's different from being on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">You sometimes go very fast through a lot of material and you say, "Gee, we have 140 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , 80 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> from which we can receive reports, individual cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Death penalty cases, people on death row for 18 years, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And you wonder, you know, you sit on this and what in-roads do you really make? </span><span class="sentence" id="910">But it's only a very -- I have that in very few moments when the going gets tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  Do you ever have moments when you think, "I'm tired of this, I'm just tired of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I've in a sense been looking at this kind of stuff my whole life, since I was a little boy, and that I would like to be looking at shipping contracts or something””?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Actually I do that sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Matter of fact, this year I was involved in a commercial arbitration as an arbitrator. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">No, you have to get a -- you can't -- first of all I've never -- there are some people who sort of live with their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> experience; it's become an obsession. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I think I would go crazy if I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">The one good thing, I've always been able to relax, with -- I don't need very much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">But if I have these meetings and they go on for three weeks, if we can then take off for just a few days, I don't carry it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And this is survivor instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">No, you have to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I get away from it in my writings, really, my academic writings. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Even though I deal a lot with human rights issues, but it's very academic and it's something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And I've tried to write at least one or two articles or a book a year so that keeps me obsessed in other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Thomas Buergenthal 66 November 28, 1995 Page 66
QUESTION:  Have you ever written about your personal experience, whether it would be for some sort of publication, or even maybe perhaps for your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  Well, after my bypass operation in '93 I decided -- my kids have been pressing me for a long time -- I decided to begin writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I've written about three or four chapters. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But I've come to the conclusion that I need -- I can't do it by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I'm much too much a lawyer when I write. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">It doesn't -- I describe things rather than -- and I've actually discussed it with somebody, that she might work with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Because what I write sort of comes out wooden in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And I don't deal -- I'm particularly bad in describing emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">But it's obvious that one needs to write it down and things come back that have long been forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I was struck by the fact that just sitting behind the computer and thinking of a certain event, a lot of things come back, names come back that I thought I'd forgotten and 50 years later suddenly the name of a camp commandant comes back to me, or the name of a <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">That's the wonderful thing about doing that and I'll continue doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">The problem is that academic books come in between them, and then other assignments that sort of -- I have about three of four chapters. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And I did write actually in <span class="BUILDING">Bethany college</span> , I did write one story and they had a publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">QUESTION:  Fiction or nonfiction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  No, a story about the death march actually, that I reread in order to give the talk at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- on the 50th anniversary of the Thomas Buergenthal 67 November 28, 1995 Page 67 Holocaust, of the death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And I had to sort of go back in order to even recall some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">No, it should be written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I've given some interviews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  You said, "It's obvious that it should be written down." </span><span class="sentence" id="944">You said that just a while ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Then you just said, "It should be written down." </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, 1t should be sort of written down for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">What strikes me about this whole thing is that when my kids were little they had no interest at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I mean, they sort of knew, and as they got older, they're now in their late 20s and early 30s, they now say, "Write it down." </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And they would say, "Well, why didn't you tell me that before?" </span><span class="sentence" id="951">You know, this story or that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But at the time really when they were young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">But now they really are very interested and they want to know this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So that's one reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I think the other reason is that these things should not be forgotten and those of us who have survived and who have the ability to recollect and express themselves about that have an obligation to put it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">It's the kind of thing that if nothing else, hopefully it will have an impact on the future, at least in making people think about how you can prevent those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And also, you know, this notion about some of the Holocaust deniers, here 1s an answer at least that this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">The further away we get from it, supposedly, more of this denial is going to come about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">QUESTION:  It seems that that's been a struggle from day one, that the Allied forces actually took Germans and showed them the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at a certain point. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Have you ever in your own Thomas Buergenthal 68 November 28, 1995 Page 68 personal experience come across someone who's denied that it happened, or the extent of it, and you've been able to say, "Hey just listen to this story’”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  No, I haven't. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I've often thought that it would be wonderful if one of these people would actually call me a liar so one could maybe bring a libel suit to try to establish the truth of what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">No, I've never had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">For many years I thought it wasn't worthwhile taking these people serious and I thought, you know, just a bunch of kooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But it's surprising how some of these people have gained a certain legitimacy and that's why it's important to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Because, of course, behind this Holocaust denial, it's not so much that they are denying it just for it's own sake but I think they're denying it in order to reestablish the type of political organizations that made this thing possible in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So it's part of the Neofascist, Neonazi- type movement, and if you can deny that, that 1t happened, then it strengthens your political movement and that's dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Are you an American citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  Yes, I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I became an American citizen in '57. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">As a matter of fact, it was -- I think I'm one of the few people who became an American citizen with the help of the FBI because I had won the nomination for the Rhodes scholarship from <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> and then from the state of West Virginia, and I wasn't a citizen yet and in order to compete in the finals I had to be a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">A lawyer in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> who had been an FBI agent and who was also a former Rhodes scholar moved all kinds Thomas Buergenthal 69 November 28, 1995 Page 69 of things to get me my citizenship, get me cleared very fast so that I could get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I had been in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> long enough but it would have taken much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But I managed to get it and I managed not to get the Rhodes scholarship because I couldn't explain in the finals why I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when I had just gotten to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which was very difficult to explain, and I really was lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">QUESTION:  They asked that specific question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">ANSWER:  They asked me a lot of other things and all of that seemed to be going well until they said, "Well, you've just become a US citizen, why do you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And I really didn't have a good answer and so I think that was one of the reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  After you became a citizen, what was it like for you -- and this would have been more recently, when there were very open Nazi rallies in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="979">What were your thoughts about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">ANSWER:  Well, I really think that the reaction to the Nazi rallies here have been wrong ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I think that one should let the people march, one should do what the Norwegians did when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">At one point, when they had a Nazi demonstration, the people all came out led by the bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> and when the marchers walked by, all of the people in the <span class="DLF">street</span> turned their backs to them in silent demonstration, which to me is the way they should be handled. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">If you start fights and everything, that's exactly what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And first of all, I think in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we have enough other mechanisms to deal with it that we don't need to prohibit those marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Let them, Thomas Buergenthal 70 November 28, 1995 Page 70 but deal with them with dignity and not pay any attention to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  I realized you mentioned your sons and we should just clarify a little bit about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Maybe you can just tell us who's in your family, how many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  I have three sons, a stepdaughter and a stepson, and they're all over the world now. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I'm married and it's my second marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">My wife is originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> but she has the same sort of mixture that I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">She's a Peruvian, Italian, British background. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">We met in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My oldest son is in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> right now working for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and he will actually be dealing with the elections in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> for the agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So that, I thought it was interesting that at least one of us in the family is going back to his roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I have one son who works here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">A third son who is clerking for a federal judge in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">My stepdaughter lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and my stepson lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">We have four grandchildren and a fifth one on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  The son who is in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , does he speak Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  No, unfortunately not, I think he regrets that he never bothered to learn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I, unfortunately, have pretty much forgotten much of my Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">But he just got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He is a lawyer by training but he worked for AID!' </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> and has now moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">It's probably more important for him to learn Russian because he's responsible for issues relating to the rule of law all over the former Soviet Thomas Buergenthal 71 November 28, 1995 Page 71 Republics and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">The <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the organization is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> but he has to be traveling all around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">QUESTION:  Which languages do you speak now’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  Well I speak English and German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I can get along in Polish and I speak Spanish quite well, really, because I had to work in Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But I learned Spanish when I first was elected to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and I learned it by, not formally, I learned it by listening to the interpretation with one ear and to the original in the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">In the process I lost both my Italian and my French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I can still get along in French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  Go back to when your sons were little, when they were about five or six or seven, maybe eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">What were your thoughts? </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Would you look at them, they were little boys like you were, did it surprise you the things they did, did it make you think about what you were like, and how much -- probably they were too young then but as they got older, how much did you tell them about what had happened to you, and have you told them everything? </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Or does a person who's heard the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> video tape, do they perhaps know a few more details about what you experienced in the camps than they do, at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">ANSWER:  I think if you saw the Holocaust video tape, they might know more than my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Although my children might know a lot of other details that they wouldn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Did I tell them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I suppose on different occasions, different little snippets, 'l Agency for International Development Thomas Buergenthal 72 November 28, 1995 Page 72 particularly when my mother used to come and visit we would reminisce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">But probably not as much either as I could have or as I should have but at the same time you really as a parent, you know, you can't just try to drum things into kids’ heads and if they don't want to ask, there's nothing much to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I think their interest is gradual, has really come more recent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But maybe, you know, I never know, because it may well be that they were afraid to ask, that they thought it would be painful, although it never has been because in our family we always talked about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">But maybe they didn't want to ask for a variety of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">They certainly, I don't think, can really imagine what it was and they never really asked that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">There was something else you asked me that I've forgotten, the first part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">It will come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">QUESTION:  For instance, have you ever --
ANSWER:  Oh, yes, I remember what you asked me, about when I looked at my children, how I would react. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Well, you know, every so often when children were sort of my age, I would look at them and I would think, could they survive this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">You know, this is the age and look, they are such children and this was the age that I was when this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Then you somehow think, yes, they could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">When you see street children in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , how street-smart they are and how they survive, you realize kids have that in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I've seen this in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , I've seen it in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Guatemala</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">These kids have that survival instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">But when you look at sort of, our Thomas Buergenthal 73 November 28, 1995 Page 73 children you say, “No, they could never make it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">But the fact is they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">There's tremendous resilience that children have, some children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Some children may be more sensitive than others but I think children are blessed with this resilience that enables them to survive better than grown-ups can survive in many situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">QUESTION:  Obviously you lost your childhood in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Is it something you got back later on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">An example would be, when you're that young you still want to be held a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Did anybody ever hold you when you were a little boy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or is that something you just lost?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">ANSWER:  No, nobody held me except my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">But it's interesting, when I came back when I found my mother, I think the first year I just stuck to her as if, you know, I kissed her all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">It was sort of all coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">But of course I missed a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">At the same time, you know, it's sort of curious but I think -- I did eight years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in one year of private tutoring and it turns out I have dyslexia which I never realized I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">One of my children has that problem and he suffered quite a lot because it appeared in first grade and second grade; it was a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I didn't know I had it until he was tested and the doctor tested me and it turned out that my case was just as serious as his but because I started so much later, I just learned how to compensate for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">So there are a lot of things that, there were also benefits. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Just to think of all the eight years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> one could have skipped without supposedly any great loss of learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Although I have always kidded by the fact that I never really Thomas Buergenthal 14 November 28, 1995 Page 74 learned the alphabet properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I never learned the ABC and stuff, all of these little things that you learned in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> I never learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1054">QUESTION:  No, you just have a doctorate degree in international law from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">It shows you that it's not that difficult, that it must be that all you have to do is just skip enough classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">QUESTION:  It is amazing, and I thought this about an hour and half ago, how much we're laughing in this discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">ANSWER:  Well, this is what I try to tell you, that those of us who went through it all went through it because we were lucky in everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">But also in a sense, and I'm still able to talk about it today, is because we weren't just weighed down by the terribleness of it, that we didn't let it affect our whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">One has to be able to laugh about things, get raving mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And some things are funny, some things are sad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">QUESTION:  Some studies have been done on children of Holocaust survivors and some have characteristics, and one is depression, is that something that has occurred in your family and do you see a link there if it has?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">ANSWER:  Fortunately, not at all, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">It may be because I have never been very introspective so it hasn't affected my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">They are—no, I don't think it has affected them at all, at least not in any negative way that I can think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Maybe if the Holocaust survivor’s husband and wife -- that might be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">But, you know, my wife was a native-born American who hasn't gone through any of this and I think that Thomas Buergenthal 75 November 28, 1995 Page 75 may make a difference, although I'm not even sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I think it depends on the family, it depends on the attitude of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">QUESTION:  What about religion? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">When you brought your children up, not just religion, Jewish culture -- how did you convey that to them as they were growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Did you make sort of a specific effort to do that and how so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">ANSWER:  Well, I wanted the children to grow up Jewish and so they went to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday School</span> , they were Bar Mitzvahed, and all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But they were not in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> in a sense that I'm not religious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I think my children are more religious, at least two of my sons often drag me to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on the High Holidays and chide me if I don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I think what I try to do which 1s sort of natural, that I try to bring them up in the Jewish sense from a cultural point of view, that they should have historical sense of what Judaism means and the contribution of Judaism to culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And they shouldn't be ashamed of it, that it's something like any other culture, to be proud of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">QUESTION:  Where did you raise them primarily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">ANSWER:  First in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I lived in, I taught, except for the first year I taught one year at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> law school and then I taught for 13 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> at the State University of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And then I taught at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Texas</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Then I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I was dean at the American University Law School. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Then I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and worked with President Carter at the <span class="BUILDING">Carter Center</span> and taught at <span class="BUILDING">Emory</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Emory University</span> , then I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Thomas Buergenthal 76 November 28, 1995 Page 76
QUESTION:  How often do you think about being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Is that something that happens a lot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">It happens only if there was some reason that would bring it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Not very much at all, only if there 1s some sort of specific event that triggers something, but otherwise I don't think about it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">QUESTION:  Are there sounds that will really bring it out, or something that will just bring back a memory? </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We talked earlier about the smell of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">What about sounds or smells?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">ANSWER:  Not really, more events. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">You know if you read about or if you see, for example, if you see the people behind the barbed wire in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , that brings it back, those types of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">But not anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Maybe some things you read about and some German words or something, that might trigger something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">But really probably there be months will go by that I don't think about it at all, it doesn't come back at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">QUESTION:  What about being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , just going on a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American Amtrack train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  You know, I haven't been on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American Amtrack train</span> for a long time but I've been on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">No, it doesn't, you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> are so comfortable compared to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I was on, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> I was on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">No that doesn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">It does sometimes when I see one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> , those sort of open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , that brings back flashbacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Or I might even say, you know, "This looks almost like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> I was in." </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">But no, not as much as one would think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1104">QUESTION:  Returning to... Thomas Buergenthal 77 November 28, 1995 Page 77
ANSWER:  Although you know, let me tell you something that strikes me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I think I mentioned it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I am much more sensitive to some of these issues as I get older and I don't know why that is, 1t bothers me in a sense because I've been able to sort of -- I've always prided myself of being able to just put 1t out of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">In the sort of last ten years its, I find it harder to do and I don't know why that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">You know, sometimes people when they get very old they suddenly only remember the language they spoke when they were little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I don't know what it is but it's strange, I sometimes feel I'm going soft because I've been able just to put things very much out of my mind all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I find I'm much more sensitive now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Certain things bother me more you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  Such as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  No, I find the death of my mother affected me tremendously and since then, I've found that things relating to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> are much harder for me to take than they were before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I haven't been able yet, I've been thinking a lot about why that should be that this connection, but it's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">It's had quite an impact on me in terms of those memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Not only, obviously anyone who's mother dies is affected by it but it's affected me in terms of the past, much more than I would have thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Or it's simply old age, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  When did your mother die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  In '93, no I'm sorry, '92. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Thomas Buergenthal 78 November 28, 1995 Page 78
QUESTION:  That's what I wanted to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Are there some things you'd like to say that I haven't touched on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">ANSWER:  No, you've been very good in getting more out of me than usual, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Just think about, I think you've -- you know it's strange, there are days when, it sometimes depends on the environment but I think we've spent, gee we've spent about three and a half hours and you've pretty much covered my life in sort of, in episodes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Conclusion of Interview. </span>
