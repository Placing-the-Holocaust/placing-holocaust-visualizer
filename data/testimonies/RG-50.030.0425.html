<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after Kristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and stayed with your sister for about a week, who was living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the rest of your family was and did you have any contact with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My family was, my whole family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My brother who had run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> had also come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , so they were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My father was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and we were living in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we had lived before. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We were searching the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything upside-down, we put the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in order and we were living there and repairing as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">In addition we tried to emigrate and find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to emigrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  And what were the results of that effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we like to help you, but we can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November ninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my mother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> , if he could do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of Parliament in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and find how to get us special permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And he would then send us what is called a landing card, that we were allowed to land. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">After a few weeks, we got this landing card. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Now the question was to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">You needed first of all, permission from the German government and they would be there when we would pack our things. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But first of all we had to get tickets to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which 1s a shipping company in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they were all booked up for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> again and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> had that, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> had a connection with <span class="DLF">British Airline</span> , with the British, not airline, with the <span class="DLF">British shipping line</span> , the Koolnot(ph) <span class="DLF">Whitestar(ph) line</span> and he met a man from there and he said he would get us passage to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">However, to get there, we needed first to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry boat</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , we would take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing cart</span> came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he arranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We were traveling five people, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But we needed money for the tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">In order to do this, we had to sell our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Now there was one woman, —_ woman, who the Nazi's had planted into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she wanted to buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Of course she bought it with very little money, just enough money to pay for the tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact the date was set by the shipping company, for May 31, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">On that day we would leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Many other things happened between December and May, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">For instance, one thing which happened was in January, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's birthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family Greenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which said, "Come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I didn't know originally from whom it came, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a Jewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and go to this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, "Go there right away." </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going at 12 at night, so I took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But 1t was a very uncomfortable trip because there were the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I walked around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was what we call a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">express train</span> , where there is a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> at the side and then there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , 1t wasn't my first time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I came to the Brandenberger(ph) gate, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a sign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very quickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization, I came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we are waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of course, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , to the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation for emigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Then they would recognize us and they would go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So the whole day we were typing out, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">type machine</span> , of course they had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric typing machines</span> at that time, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission, they were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , I still have some letters in my files, and we gave them to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">However, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So that was in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">First of all, were you at this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  And in terms of this operation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , what was this organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) Israel and they were trying, like everyone else, trying to get Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would accept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake, because especially the <span class="REGION">South American countries</span> , <span class="REGION">Latin American countries</span> were working very much with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American diplomats very many times and they said to me, "Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will let you out." </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that company, to that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were all working together. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people went out and they were not permitted in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because they said we don't, these are illegal certificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But the Nazi's were very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see, either by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they measured them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  This organization that you were working with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , was this in place for years, was this an outgrowth of political organizations you were involved with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They were more or less a Jewish __—__—s more, I would say more religious kind of organization than another kind of organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But all organizations tried somehow to bring their members or to bring Jews out, because I can tell you, later on when I, all right, that comes later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Were you, my question is, were you affiliated with this organization or similar organizations, years before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They had such an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist organization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious reasons and then there was a special teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he was from this organization, from Agoutis(ph) Israel and I joined him. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So I was already affiliated with this organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  The focus was to work for the Jews to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , mainly at that time, you see and also religiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more religious instead of assimilation. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was a question of assimilation. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was a question of assimilation, emancipation. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  And you felt that was important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more on Shabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation marks, more German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came from a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish
QUESTION:  Back to Agoutis(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , was there any risk to what you were doing or was this basically authorized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done, because the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had the final solution, you see and they didn't want them to __1n there, they said, "The world does not take them, the world does not want them." </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these people go and go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people...
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has names, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave them different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So that's how they were choosing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  So you helped whoever you could?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Whoever, yeah, _..
QUESTION:  And how did you know that somebody was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> or somebody was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , or wherever?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  These people sometimes wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">If they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , it say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They wrote and at that time, we knew where the people were, besides this, as I can tell you later, I had some contact with the Gestapo and they told me that, "We have people here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> ," and so forth and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  How long did you work with Agoutis(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on this one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them go, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I was still in contact with them afterwards, but this was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that day and made it all final, in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Busy day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at nighttime that they may knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also in January one day they came, an ominous knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> 1n the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My brother who were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and they had sent him to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">First he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , somehow, they arranged with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , I don't know who, how, but he was in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So one night, they knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I made myself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, "What can I lose?" </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I go downstairs, I open up. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went downstairs, I opened up and he came in, not in Nazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant for your brother, Benu(ph), his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I said to them, "Don't you know that he is in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They came through, they put upside-down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said, "You should have known that he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He said, "Yeah, excuse me" and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But they came in and they made a person scared, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They could always come in, middle of the night and knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which was about, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So this was 1939, in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">In February, the congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , the Jewish congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , organized itself again and they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> any more to live, so there was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a brother of this Greenberg and they had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and they had already left this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in September 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the Bremen congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I met him later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But this was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and there were maybe 20 families living in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now, besides that's the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the congregation, was also in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we organized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Number one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I knew a little bit of English, not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Number two, we organized some courses for women in sewing and other things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weisaminda(ph</span> ), which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven(ph</span> ), that wanted some people to come and talk to them, so I went there sometimes and talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Number four, we wanted to make a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> again because the children did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I can speak about this later. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And, besides this, number five, they wanted a person from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> to be acontact _, going to the Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe three times a week and tell them about what was happening in the congregation, so I was elected, appointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So I went there

<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Were you and your father living in this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , <span class="BUILDING">community house</span> now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No, we did not live in this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community house</span> , we lived in our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but many people had no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> any more, especially people from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Many people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , most people, most Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , did not live in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , they lived in small hamlets, how do you call it, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and they came then to the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> to be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So they appointed me and I went to the Gestapo and I never knew whether I would come out because __—_—sdGGestapo was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which had no sign <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You didn't know that it was a <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was in a section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , they had and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> was a medieval city and it had a <span class="DLF">trench</span> around it and around the <span class="DLF">trench</span> was a <span class="DLF">street</span> which was called Amvahl(ph), it means ______ in the war, there used to be war in medieval Germany, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> had a <span class="DLF">wall</span> around it and when I came there I had to push a button on top and the <span class="DLF">door</span> would open and I would go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And when I went in, there was a big picture, a man with two fingers on his lips that said silence, schweigne(ph), quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then someone would tell me, "Come upstairs." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I didn't know who it was, but I went upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I went upstairs, I went into this <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and it was all clattered around with all kinds of things and this man was sitting there and his name was Mr. Parchman, I still remember that P-a-r-c-h-m-a-n and he was nobody, an illiterate person —.:~And he said to me, "Sit down." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Of course they address the Jews as Uder(ph) in German and they were very, very rude. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Then he took out and I remember the first time I came, he took out a bunch of pictures and papers and he said to me, "These are the pictures and papers which we rescued from your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Rescued, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Was not rescued, they confiscated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I said, "Can I have them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So he gave me a little bit, not everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Why were they so nice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  They did not want to be complete, you see, every person, even the worst person in the world, sometimes has a soft moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So he also had a soft moment at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He gave me a little bit, but what I asked him then, most of the time when I went to him, I asked him, "Can you get this person and this person," I've got a few names of people from the Jewish congregation who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , "I want this person to get out, can you get him out, will you let him out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And that was the main purpose in the first part of my contacts with them, to save people, to let them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Sometimes he let them out, but not very many times, he said, "What's he going to do, where's he going to go," so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The second part of my contact with the Gestapo was to have permission to make a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , because the children didn't have any more <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they were forbidden to go in <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , even in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So what do we want to teach them in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I want to teach them how to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as quick as possible, because that's what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So what would he teach them? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I will teach them English and geography and certain things which they might be able to use after the emigrate and also I will teach, I will give them a little bit of exercise, gymnastics or so, you see they have to be strong when they leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So they went on, they said, "We have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for German children and besides," says, "when do you want to teach the children?" </span><span class="sentence" id="147">In the morning you are not allowed to teach them, he told me, because then German children are being taught and German children cannot be taught at the same time when Jewish children are being taught and the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So I, I negotiated with him for a long time and he didn't want to give us a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , then I said to him, "What about a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ," and I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , "near, near that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there, no one is there, it's not a <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> , but 1t could be used as a <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> and we can use it in the afternoon." "</span><span class="sentence" id="149">When do you want to teach the children, what time? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Because the German children go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until three-thirty in the afternoon, you can only teach them from four until about six or six-thirty." </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So finally he agreed and we had this <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take the Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Now I made a list of Jewish children, we had about 40 Jewish children at that time, boys and girls in all ages, up to 15 or 16 years of age and some of them came from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But the question was teachers, we had no teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So I knew some merchants, you see and I said to them, you teach him this, you teach him this and I'll tell you what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So we, we had a few teachers, you see and they were not trained teachers, but I said the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> should not be like a very slow, a very low <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , but more like a <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> or so, like a little bit higher school and that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> opened on April 12th, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in May 1939, end of May, May 31, 1939, so I was there just two months, but during that time, I hired a teacher, one of my, one of my colleagues from ———_—s <span class="BUILDING">Seminary</span> , where he was, had learned to be a teacher and he became my successor and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> stayed until about 1941, I think, when all the Jews were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pinsk</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Couple questions, I guess about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You said there were about how many students who were able to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  And were they all ages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  All ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Anybody who could, come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Anybody who could come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Do you think that that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was helpful in terms of morale, in terms of education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yes, it was very helpful I think, because the parents, I mean when we had our first meeting and I gave them the introductory talk about what the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was going to be and what we would be teaching and so the parents also came and it was very helpful and in fact, I met two of my students from that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">In fact, one of my, one of, no, at least two students who I met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , they are now married, you know and their husbands came to my classes here, which I gave here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, it was helpful, I think. [</span><span class="sentence" id="170">end of side one, tape one]
QUESTION:  I want to ask you a few questions about the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Do you think that everybody living together served a purpose other than just a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">First of all, it was safer, they felt safer being together, you see, being among friends, being among people of their own kind, I mean, that already makes them feel safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And besides this, if they had any problems, they had right away in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , people whom they could ask and turn to, because these, and these, their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> you see, had contacts with getting food, getting other things and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Did the Germans periodically come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , visit the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  They knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I don't remember any more, if they came, because I wasn't living there, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Did people get around much or did they largely stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  No, at that time it was still possible to walk around, to go places, it was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The first time that actually, I mean that was long time ago, if they remember the first boycott, which was 1933 ____, but at that time, you could go, you could walk around, of course you had to be careful and the Nazis were not all, Nazis, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">There were also some Germans who still thought, it will pass over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  But when you walked on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , wasn't there a certain element of fear, a certain element of risk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Yes, you felt things might come, as I mentioned before, especially during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The Nazis were using what is called two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They were using deception and dehumanization. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That means they were deceiving people and make believe it was not so, it's not bad, you can do what you want, you see, so people went around, but they were never safe if something would happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So they were careful and they walked around usually, not by themself, but with a friend, with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Did people get beat up or anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Or just grabbed and taken somewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  That happened usually during the night when no one saw it, because Nazis did not want to do anything during daytime, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That's why all the time, they were still a little bit reluctant to do things so openly, because they didn't want the world, the press to know about that, that they do do it openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They wanted the world to know and to fear that whatever they did is by law. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Therefore they made a law, Jews cannot go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They made a law, lawyers cannot have practice in here any more and things like this, they wanted to do everything by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Now, to your knowledge, the people who were living in this <span class="BUILDING">community house</span> , did they have plans, were the plans to try to emigrate, what did they thing was going to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  At that time, after Krystallnacht, the whole world saw and the Jews also knew, even those Jews who still loved <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for a long time and they had family trees and they had ancestors, they saw that you cannot live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So everyone from that moment on, worked on emigration, to find out the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go, because they knew there was no, that's why I called my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the <span class="BUILDING">Dead End school</span> , it was only toward an end, because we knew we wouldn't exist forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">There would come a time, you see, when we would have to close and we did close afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  One more question about that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because I'm just trying to get a sense of what the daily life was like at this period in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Did they, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , people had to make arrangements for religious activities or for getting food, or was there any culture or cultural activities, anything like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  Well, they had ___ services, religious services in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , they had some classes, you see, I also gave some classes as I said before, for translation for English and so forth and __. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">However, the community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> consists actually of two types of Jews, there's one type of Jews which were the German Jews who were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and who lived there a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Then there were, was a little community, a little bit away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> of Eastern Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They call it in German _, who came from eastern. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I was very friendly with them, you see, because I went there many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They had their own community. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But they had all their culture alive, because when they stay together, you see, they either were learning a few subjects or they were preparing for emigration, they were taking your job, they were learning a language, they were learning something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Okay, your work with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Initially you said when you went in, there was someone who took you up to Mr. Parchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Were there always the same people there that you dealt with, or were there different officers there all the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  They were all different, but I had this particular person, Mr. Parchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I always saw him, most of the ttme. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He was__sinchargeofthe Jews _ problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He was in charge and so I had to see him because he was the one appointed by the Nazis to have the contact with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I always saw the same person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  How would you describe your relationship with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  I never knew what he would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I never knew what he would say, but I never knew whether, whether he would let me go out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I never knew what kind of questions he would ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But I told him all the time, as I mentioned before, I was working on two, in two <span class="REGION">areas</span> with him, first of all to get Jews out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , number two to have a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And that was my main relationship with him and he was sitting there with his feet on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and, and trying to degrade me, __ sit down and things like this, but I did not really play, play a game with him to say that I would do everything what he wanted me to do or so, but, but you have to know what, about what you want to say and you have to feel what, how he would react. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I never knew how he would react, but I just was normal, normally, normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I don't know if is this what you mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Well, I'm trying to get a sense of how you, instinctively knew how to handle yourself, whether he was particularly abusive and in what way and how you responded to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  I tried not to make him feel embarrassed or attack the Nazi system. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I just talked from my point of view, that means when my point of view, the point of view of the Jews you see, that we are here now and I know that you don't want us here and we want to leave and that was always my basic philosophy, my basic philosophy was let the Jews out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , so that they can leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , let us make a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so that we can prepare them for emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was always, my philosophy was always to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that's really what he wanted, so I actually played on his wavelengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  That was smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Was he ever physically abusive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Just verbally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Now were you able, did you have access to special information because of this position or job, that you were able to then take back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Yes, for instance, sometimes he would tell me, we let these people out in three days, or this person is now in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He would give me some names sometimes, but most of the time he didn't want to give information, he wanted information from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He wanted information, you see, what are the Jews doing there? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I mean, do they have money, do they emigrate and things, well how far are they, do we have services, what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He wanted from me, but I got something from him too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Did you tell him whatever he wanted to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  I sometimes told him and sometimes not. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">For instance, he asked me, from where are these? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And he showed me all the things which he had taken out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> __—.:~XHe asked me, "Do you know this, do you know this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So I said to him, "You know better than I do, because you took it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So where did you find it, what did you do with it." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">No, I never, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Were there any other Jewish people who would go to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> or just you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  I would go there regularly, I don't think anyone else would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He would sometimes come, I don't even know if he would come to the president, I know Mr. Ostrich(ph), I think his name was, I don't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">If he wanted something, he, but I was the one who would go there, I think I was the only one who would go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  One other question, you said you never really knew what was going to happen when you went there, were you ever really caught off guard? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Were there some close calls and big surprises, good or bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I don't remember anything of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">No, he always considered himself a nice guy, quotation mark, by letting me go again and when I asked for instance, my brother should come out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I mean, he let him out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I don't know now, it's too long ago, whether it was, probably a both combination of him and the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , somehow a combination, I don't know how they worked together and he came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But I never had a clash with him in that way that he surprised me with something or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He surprised me the very first time, that he had all the things, I was surprised that he had all these things which he had taken out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Now, you were at this point, I'm trying to figure out, how old you were, about early 20's?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">21.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  21, you were taking on a lot of responsibility, it sounds like you had guts and good instincts. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">What do you think prepared you for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Ihave a philosophy you see, if possible to make a compromise and I had to make a compromise, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for instance, when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And besides this I made a compromise when I went with the Zionist youth club and, and when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , I studied at the sin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and then afterwards I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> and I tried to bring people closer and make them accept it and so forth all the time, so I think I had this kind of thing, even I talked to the Nazi teachers in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I always tried to compromise in a certain way, but not give up my principles, because when the teachers told me that you cannot go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, I mentioned this already before and I just said to him, "We are on the same wavelength, you be a Nazi and I be a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So you go your way and learn more about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I am a Jew and I want to learn more about being a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Do you think that you got any of this common sense from your family or you just learned it on your own in the way you were brought up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Part of it, of course, I got from my family, especially my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">She came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and she was always welcomed and she was always recognized and tried to make people friendly and in our business you see, when people came to our business buying and selling, for repairs and so forth, she did favors for all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">She wrote letters for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">At that time, we didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> , so people wrote longhand, she had a very good handwriting, so she wrote letters for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And my father, who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , also and then of course myself, because since I went to a non-Jewish school, I had to do, excuse me, since I went to a non-Jewish school, I had to be able to live together with them and to talk to them you see, not only about myself, but also about them and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So I had a lot of friends and even had so many friends in my class that even after | cameto __, they wanted to make me class president, but I didn't want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  So you worked with the Gestapo and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> until you were able to emigrate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Not through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The reason they, as I started to tell you before, we wrote to all people and we got the landing cards from my cousin, from my father's cousin and then my father arranged for us to emigrate, so it really came from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , it didn't come from the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  Right, but you worked as a liaison with them until the time when you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you feel you want to say about that period in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before we talk about your emigrating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Yes, there is one thing, we started the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on April 12th, 1939 and I went there every day, I don't, I think we only were allowed to be in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> two or three times a week and then when we had to give up the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , our whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so I was there when we packed, we packed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and the man was standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Some people tried to slip in certain things, but I was afraid to put in anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I wanted to put in some newspapers from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where they spoke about the Nazis, one paper I put in, about there was a law that Jews were only allowed to have certain names and my name was not Jewish enough and therefore I had to add the name Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Girls and women, who had no Jewish name, according to them it was not a Jewish name, had to put in Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">My sister Elisa(ph), Elisa(ph) Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">My brother's name, Abraham was not a Jewish name, Abraham Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Joseph was not a Jewish name, because they had a Nazi the name of Joseph, Joseph Goebbels(ph) and same thing even though Rosenthal, Rosenberg is a Jewish name, but he was one of the philosophers of the Nazis, Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So, __.:-~‘Then another thing about this, when we left, before we left, we had what we call, what they call in German achmeldon(ph), it means to register, to sign yourself out. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You sign in and you sign out. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You sign out, so you had to sign out before you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and go to the police and fill out that you signed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So I went to the police and I said, we are leaving on May 31st, I want to sign out. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He said to me, "Fill out this form." </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Filled out the form and he said, "But you didn't fill out your address where you're going to move to." </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I said to him, "I don't know it yet." </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So he said to me, "Never mind, we Nazis will soon conquer the whole world and we will find you there anyhow." </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And they were really sure of themselves, that that would happen, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I said to him, "I hope not."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  This is maybe an unusual question, but was the fear in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this point great enough that you actually thought there might be danger elsewhere, or did you feel that once you got out, you'd be safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  I only thought about one thing, I said to myself, I want to be as far away from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as possible, because one day there might be war and they might conquer the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> around here, so therefore I thought that the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> were too close and even <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I thought was too close. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So when we, when we went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I thought, that's better, because it's further away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  So tell me about the process of your leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  All right, we packed everything and we left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , as I mentioned before, I had nearly forgotten this, but I found my passport, it says we left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And we saw our relatives still, on the last day and then we were supposed to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> , that passed on the Wednesday, I think, Wednesday the 31st of May, in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And we went be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  And this was, who all was in this ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  That was my father, my, and all four, all four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we came to the <span class="DLF">port</span> and, but our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> had to do a detour because on that day, it just so happened that Goering(ph) gave a speech and we had to have a detour and he gave a speech on that day that was the first time that I heard it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where he acknowledged and told the world that they were good friends of Franco, <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> you know, and that he was sending them soldiers and sending them all other things, you see, they were supporting them completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So we went on, we came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Before we went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> , they examined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I have to tell you that we were only allowed to take four dollars out, each person, four dollars, it was 10 ricemark(ph), 10 marks, German marks, four dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It was all we were allowed to take out and then we had nothing else because the rest of the money which we got for the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was for the tickets, for the, for the boat tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So my father they examined completely, I don't know why they didn't examine us completely, they just made a checkup you see, like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And then we came to on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Now other than the four dollars a person, what kind of mementos did you take with you, what did you pack?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  When we packed, we packed clothing, a certain amount of clothing and we packed a few books, which I had and also, I forgot to mention that the rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , at that time, Rabbi Kalibar(ph), who was later, who didn't want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he was afterwards killed by the Nazis, he gavemea___, it means a Torah scroll, which I took along, but not, but which was put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was sent separately, we took only along a little valise, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So we took a few things along, not too many things and a few pictures and jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Personal things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  So you got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ...
ANSWER:  Now this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was about 1400 tons, was a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it was a very nice sailing from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , through the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">First it goes on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Elba</span> and then it comes to Cookshaven(ph), which is at the, as the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elba</span> flows into the... and up to there it comes to a certain <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , which 1s called Helgaland(ph), which was completely submerged during the war, but now it's up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And up to that time, we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">~After that time, we all got seasick, especially me, because the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> is a very rough <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and we were supposed to be there on, when was it, Thursday evening, but we didn't get there until Friday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we landed, we landed in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grimsby</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grimsby</span> , G-r-i-m-s-b-y, it's a little bay, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grimsby Bay</span> , it's in <span class="REGION">central Britain</span> , I think and we went there, we landed there and the, the company, the ship company had made arrangements that from there they would pick us up by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and bring us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> over the weekend and a Sunday we would continue from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grimsby</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we went out and I think we took a hack out, spent our first money and then we took the, we were late to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British train</span> and very fast, went all the way down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , the current <span class="DLF">Whitestar(ph) line</span> had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> for us, I think us and other passengers who would be going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> and showed us around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , saw the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">financial district</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And then they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">kosher hotel</span> , this was the first time since 1933 that we had meat again, because the meat was forbidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . __—, </span><span class="sentence" id="323">the _____ was forbidden, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">One of the first laws that Hitler made in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So and we had a good meal there, in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and also there was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> nearby, which was bombed out later, on the _, it's called the Great <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> and we saw that at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And on the day of Sabbath, the Shabbat, we went for a walk, it was in east end in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , east end I think it's called and not far from the <span class="DLF">tower bridge</span> , we went to the <span class="DLF">tower bridge</span> and we maybe walked over there, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So we, so we went there and was very nice there. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Then on Sunday, we continued by, was it <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I think a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , yeah there's a <span class="DLF">port</span> from where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> would be going. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> and we went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , was a 14,000 ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and the name I remember was Alaunia, A-l-a-u-n-1- a, which was bombed during the war I think, and sank. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And about three o'clock in the afternoon, we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  The other people on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , were they mixed, were there a lot of refugees or Jewish and non- Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  There were Jews and non-Jews, but there were a number of, a great number of refugees, because we found out later on there were some refugees who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and to, we, they also went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , because this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and, and my family still had contact with them after they had left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So we left at three o'clock, I even made a poem about it, May 31st of 1939, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was clear and <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> fine, to make believe here governs right, but it was not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So we went on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it was supposed to be 10 days to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , but it took 14 or 15 days because in summer, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> goes further north and that's a shorter way, supposed to be, on the globe, but about in a few days later, we came into the section of the icebergs, because we went too far north and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was standing still for two or three days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , in the <span class="REGION">Atlantic Ocean</span> and we saw many things, we couldn't go up any more, because there were fish jumping over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , all right, that's not of importance, but we were all a little bit seasick, not as much as on the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> and then we came to, finally, passing by <span class="REGION">Labrador</span> and ... End of Tape 1 Tape 2
ANSWER:  I just talked about our trip from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and that we were kept for three days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , because of nearing the icebergs. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So finally we came to, past Newfoundland, Labrador, we came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saint Lawrence River</span> , the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , to bring us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We first stopped in <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> and in <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> , someone came to the, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in, from a Jewish agency and told us that he would expect us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and then bring us directly to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Now most of the other Jewish people who were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , knew where they would be going, they knew they would be going to relatives whom they knew already, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , or not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And these relatives would be there to expect them and they would be arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">The trip on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saint Lawrence River</span> was a very wonderful trip and we enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Continuing, we came finally to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , but the trip was very slow and instead of coming there in the afternoon as we had expected, we came there in the evening about nine o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And there is a certain regulation that if a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> comes to <span class="DLF">port</span> after nine o'clock, I don't know if this is 1n all <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , but were there, if a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> comes after nine o'clock, then the passengers can either depart, go off or stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> until the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The others, most of the others had relatives waiting there, but we didn't know anyone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and so we preferred to stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Next morning, we got ready to disembark and the man came again from the, from the JIAS, it's called, the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society and he said to us he would take us and he would first bring us to a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , not <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , to a little <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> for breakfast and then he would bring us straight to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and where we would leave by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yorktown</span> , <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> , that's where our cousin was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">However, it was a Friday morning and we wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> if at all possible, at least over the Sabbath and we asked him, so he said no, that can't be done, because we have strict orders from the Canadian government, that all the refugees, greenhorns, they are called at that time, greenhorns, I don't know from where the name greenhorn comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Maybe green as the _is green. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So the greenhorns have first to be, have, cannot stay where they want to stay, they must go to their <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take care of them and the government will not take care of them, the Canadian government did not want to take care of them, they just wanted them out as much as possible, because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was not so friendly to the greenhorns, because I know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , where people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were sent to and stayed there for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Okay, so my father and we, and we children, all left and he brought us to a small <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and we had breakfast there and then he brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Now the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> at that time was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Canadian Pacific Train</span> , railroad company I think it was and it was a small <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , I wouldn't call it more than a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was a small <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and it was in June, on June 15th and it was very hot in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , we never had such heat before in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was very hot and winter's very cold, summer's very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And we were sitting there and he, I don't know if he gave us a ticket, or somehow we stayed there, it was about 10 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So we thought of how, what can we do in order to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , so we remembered one thing, that we had written to relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , my father had a cousin from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ekatarinaslav(ph</span> ) in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , who was a tailor and who had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and we had written them, but the letter had come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , addressee not found. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So we said, maybe he's, he's still living there, my father said and he was sure that he was still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Maybe we can find out, but how can we find out? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So about 10:30 I think it was, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and two nuns came in, because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> is Catholic, you see and two nuns came in and they put on a light and the light said, traveler's aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So my father said, "Maybe these nuns can find out if this family's still living here." </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So he went over to the nuns, but the nuns didn't speak English and we didn't speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So what language are you speaking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So they knew Russian, my father spoke Russian to them and he told them that we think there is a family living here, if they knew that we would be here, they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown(ph), <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So the nuns said, but what's their name? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Said Kaplan. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">There are many Kaplans, come to find out, Caplan with a C, Kaplan with a K. What's the first name? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Burr(ph) Kaplan. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">What's his profession? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">What's his mother's, his wife's name? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Bebe(ph), I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So they came and they took the telephone book I think, or address book that they had at that time and they went through it and they called up all these people and they called up and people came to the the phone and they said, no, I'm not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ekatarinaslav(ph</span> ), I'm not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So they called up 15, 16 people, then they called up someone and there came a young boy at that time, of my age, from the phone and he said, I don't know, but I'll call my mother, so he called his mother, his mother says, "Yes, my husband's name is Burr(ph), he's a tailor, he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ekatarinaslav(ph</span> ), what are you calling about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They said, "There are some people who are claim you are relatives and they want to talk to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Okay, so made my father talk to them and my father right away recognized him, he seen him, he, not he, his wife, they hadn't seen each other for, at that time I mean, 15, 20 years and she said, "What? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You're here? </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I have a son who is a pharmacist, his name is Jackie, so I call him and have come right over and we take you into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So we waited about 15 or 20 minutes and then he came and he came and he took us all and we went to, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Kaplan's</span> and we stayed there for a few days and in the mean time we did not go to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But, what happened was this, in the mean time, about 11 o'clock, we had received a telegram, I don't know how it came to us, it came to the JIAS, probably, because the JIAS had sent them a telegram that your refugee, your family is here and we are going to send them right on to you, so they had sent a telegram, Western Union, I still have the certificate and they said to them, "Stay where you are, we cannot support you here because we had droughts for several years." </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They were farmers and I was supposed to be a farmer and the young fellow at that time, who was about my age, I would be his farmer, you see and I never had seen the family, just recently, last year only, I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Now he is 72 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">At that time he was 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So what happened 1s, stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So he said to us, the man from the JIAS said to us, that doesn't matter because he promised to let you stay there and the Canadian government made us promise them that we will send them all back there, but this is ___s = how we stayed there, through <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because the ___ out about it. _</span><span class="sentence" id="382">I don't know what happened to the tickets, but we stayed there, so we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  That's amazing, it must have been an amazing experience finding your family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  Now why didn't you want it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  First of all, it was too far out and was too many things to do and I wanted to stay in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> or some other big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  And with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So what happened is, my father found, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , another cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">His name was Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph) and Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph), he was already a little bit older, not too old he wasn't, only like 50, 60 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So he came over to us and he said to me, "You went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> , as a teacher, you see and you were in __, go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">That's the only, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> there isn't much Yiddishgad(ph)," Jewishness, "you go <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And at that time, just at that time, they closed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Up to that time students could come very easily to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but it was closed in 1938 or 1939, that you needed more than just this, you needed a reason, other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So, I didn't think much of it and I said, "What can you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="420">But one day he called us up, this Fevel(ph) and said, "I saw in a Jewish paper, there was a Yiddish paper, written in Yiddish, it's for the Americana, the American and it said on the front page of this," unfortunately I don't have that paper any more, I hadit for _—_—.:~'"On the front page of this paper is a big picture of refugees, who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and some of them came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> ", from where I had studied, and he said he wants to show it to me and if I recognized any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had no interest in that, but I said to myself, "What can you lose? </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Go to him and look at it.". </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So I went to him one day, it was in August, I think it was in August and, and he showed me the picture and I recognized a few people on these pictures, I recognized them. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Besides this I read the article and it mentioned a certain Kalibar(ph), Rabbi Kalibar(ph), not that Kalibar(ph), related to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And he said to me what I do is, what I should do is, I should write to this yeshiva(ph) near <span class="BUILDING">Israel College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , it's still existing. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And I should tell them about this and see what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So I wrote to them, it's in here, and I got an answer right away and the answer said, "We will accept you. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We will accept you. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We will give you an affidavit and just come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Go to the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> and have it verified." </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Now at that time, to get permission to go from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ...
QUESTION:  To the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  To the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , was the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , he had the final say, not the Justice Department, they didn't have a Justice Department yet, the Naturalization Department yet, that was only instituted later. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But go to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> and it was a very nice man, it was a British man, because at that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was not it's own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , 1t was a dominion, British dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yeah, actually, it was a British dominion, it said here, a commonwealth, but it only became a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> by itself in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Then it was independent of <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , but at that time it was still dependent on <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So I said to the Consul, I told them my story and he was very receiving, accepting it and he said to me, "But you don't have a valid passport, number one, number two, it's not so easy for students to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> now, number two, you don't have citizenship at all, you are not even a Canadian domiciled person, because you lived here less than six months, because we came in June 15th and this was August. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">You lived here less than... and you only gained citizenship, domicile in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , after six months, so you are not domiciled person, so I cannot let you go." </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I said, "But I promise that I will come back, because my family is here." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">He said, "Still." </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So he said, "I will do something special," he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="443">I will call my consul together and discuss it with them and then you come before this consul and they can make a decision." </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So he made a, he called his people together, I don't know who was his high officials and I talked to them about the story and they said to me, finally and they, and they sent me out and then they called me back and said, "We made a decision, we made a decision that we will let you go, as a student, until February, because you're, that means 60 days before your passport expires. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Your passport expires in April 21st, we will let you go until February 21st, under the condition that when you come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , when you come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , you will have your passport extended by the Germans." </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So I made the arrangements, and so I had the permission here now to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , however, how will I get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So I went again to the JIAS and I had no money and the JIAS gave me 30 dollars, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">That was the amount of the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I went with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Greyhound bus</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Now, let me ask you a couple of questions for the record.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  When you said you didn't have any citizenship, maybe you can explain why you didn't have a German's passport, why you were stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Because certainly you were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  In Europe, especially in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , you have the citizenship of your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">My father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and he was a Russian citizen at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">However, in, shortly before the first World War I think, he came over to the, he came over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he stayed there and he got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , 1916 he got married and then he stayed there and he had, he was working and he had his own bicycle business and motorcycle business. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And then in 1921, 1922, 1923, when <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> became Soviet Republic and they made it law, I think in 1933 was the final law, that anyone who left <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> before it became the Soviet Republic, has to return in order to retain his citizenship and my father didn't want to return to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , because he just escaped because in the very beginning of the century, they would capture the Jewish children and let them work for 25 years in the army, cantoons(ph) they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So he didn't want to return, so he lost his citizen, he became stateless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  So technically, how'd you stay, had you been able to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and you had had a child there, your child would have been a German citizen, although...
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  But you were...
ANSWER:  My, all my family is stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Only if you buy the German citizenship, because there was a time, at the end of the 1920's that you could buy the German citizenship for 50 marks and they came many times to my father's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and said buy, become a German, but my father said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="463"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is the source of all anti-Semitism, I don't want to be and it was good, because afterwards they took it away from them anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So he never bought German citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He remained stateless all his life and when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , they became Canadian citizen, not I and when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I became American citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  So you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> by yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Yeah but there, before I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , there's something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I, all right, when we came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , to the <span class="DLF">American border</span> , they examined all my luggage and I had Tosefa Torah, which I spoke to you before, with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They didn't know what it was, but I explained it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So we came then, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , first we come from, we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the middle of the night, 11, 12 o'clock at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And my father had told me that he had a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , Eiseman(ph), whom he had once saved in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he was in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and he had given him an affidavit and he was able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> already, in the 20's. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And he had sent us an affidavit at that time, we could have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go because she had all the relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So we missed up on that opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I said, "I'm going to call up this person." </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I didn't know very much about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we, we, at the <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> , I think, we, there was a <span class="BUILDING">Greyhound station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So I called him up in the middle of the night, of course, I didn't know very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So then I said I have to wait until the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Then in the morning I called up again, six or seven o'clock now and at that time they didn't, not everyone had a telephone, there was probably one telephone for the whole <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and people had to be called and come down to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It's a little bit of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So I call them and I said, "Is there a Mr. Eiseman(ph) living in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="481">and the woman said, "Yes, yes there are, I'll call him, I'll call him." </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And he came down to the phone and he heard me and when he heard me, he said, "Where are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="483">You are going to stay here for a few days, I want you to stay here for a few days" and he will come and see me. "</span><span class="sentence" id="484">So where do you live?" </span><span class="sentence" id="485">This Mr. Eiseman(ph) lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and I didn't know the distances here, I thought maybe in half an hour he can come over, he said, "No, it takes me at least two and a half hours." </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Long distances. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And it was 1939, they had the World's Fair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time, I don't know if you remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So he said and he wants to show me the World's Fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So I waited there in the <span class="BUILDING">Greyhound station</span> and finally he came over, his wife was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I think and his daughter, they came and they came and they picked me up at 10 o'clock or so and we went to a <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> there and then he took me to the __ and _I stayed with him maybe at least overnight, one night, I don't remember any more how long and then next morning, I continued to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You came to, first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and then you were treated to the World's Fair?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Did it seem at all strange to you that everybody was enjoying life and going, you know and celebrating and having a good time, when so much, so much was going on in Europe that was very different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I forgot to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">When I, when we came to, when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , I forgot to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">At that time I was still, in Jewish they call it the year of mourning, one year of mourning after a parent dies or —_—__..._:I_was still in the year of mourning after my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I came there, we came there in June, 1939, my mother had been killed in November, 1938 and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to say Kaddish and I came to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and I wanted to say a certain prayer which we usually say if someone is saved from a danger, they say a certain prayer, which is called Gomelbenchen(ph), you see and there were all people there and they said, "You don't have to say that." </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I said, "Why not?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="501">It's not so bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Because, I could not understand, as I was completely disappointed, that the people here in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , did not think it was as bad as it really was, because I don't know from where they got their information, because these people, these old men who were there and didn't want me to say it, I said it anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">All right, they were not religious, that's one thing, but they did not believe that it was that bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that it was <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that we were saved, we were far away from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I could not believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And then in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> also, they enjoyed thems... [end of side one, tape two]
ANSWER:  So I couldn't understand the people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , they were enjoying themselves, were having a good time, and that they did not want to believe, or did not believe that it was so bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Did it make you angry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  I was disappointed, because I, I, I saw everything, like miracles happened here, that I had come out, we had come out, that we found relatives, that I was able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They were all miracles, because I never thought of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Did, did a lot of what you observed seem frivolous to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  Yes, I think they did not feel with the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I mean, it was quite different in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time, even though <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is nowadays probably the best <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to live in in the whole world, but it seemed to me at that time at least, that it was more a detached kind of relationship, that the people had with each other and not a kind of very close kinship relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Because everything went like automatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Business-like, more business-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And we have, in our family, I mean they're talking about, about family life, but we had more a family kind of relationship, not only with the family, but with other people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The people who came from Europe still had this kind of relationship, to a certain extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Did you feel a responsibility to let people know what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Or to warn them, to give them information?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Whoever wanted to know, I told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I told the British Consul in Amer, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and I told after that, the <span class="BUILDING">Canadian Consul</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">British Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , I told, also spoke about this, I talked about this and these people be more interested in knowing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But the people who really should know about it, you see, they're not so much interested in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  What other first impressions, before we talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , what other first impressions did you have of <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I mean, was there any culture shock, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  I knew that, that first of all, religion was completely different in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> than it was in Europe or especially in my <span class="REGION">section</span> , even though in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , many of them or most of them are not religious, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But here it was also different, as I said, it was more, how do you call it, stylish. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That means, organized and not so, what we call in Yiddish, Haemish(ph), Haemish(ph) means having a close bond relationship, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">My relatives, I mean my father's relatives, the Kaplans, you see, were very, were very friendly and they had ___ this kind of relationship, a warm relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But in other <span class="NPIP">circles</span> , it was just to a certain point, as I said before, when I went the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and I saw these people there, they more or less were for themselves, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They didn't care so much about what was going on anywhere in the world at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And I think that was also one of the reasons why the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> didn't recognize what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until much later and Roosevelt had a hard time to convince them to, to do something about it, the War Relief Fund and so, they came all much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I hope it's not true, but that was true at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Were you able, once you came over here, to get any direct information from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from Europe, to sort of contin, follow up on what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  While I was in, while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , let's say, I wrote to relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I got a few answers, but all these answers were censored, because all the letters came back with censored by so and so and so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And in the end, I didn't hear anything any more at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And some people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gave me pictures, I should do something about it, but I couldn't even do anything about myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  When you stopped getting any information, did that alarm you at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  I knew that bad things were happening there and I knew it from some people, again from my organization, Agoutis(ph) Israel, because when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> there was one man, who came every week from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and he had cousins there, he was my roommate, next door roommate you see, came every Thursday to go back to what, he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , excuse me, not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and stopped over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And he had very much information. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I knew that what, that what was going on, that it was not good and he was working in it, in this organization very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I knew things were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But I knew, the way the letters came to me from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from the, indirectly, I knew what was happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And they'd all try, instance, so and so is on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">That meant he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Or when they wrote for instance, we had to change, that means that they displaced them and sent them to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I think once I sent a 20 dollar mark, which I had just how some __, I never heard of again, it was against the law, I sent it in an envelope. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">20 mark wasn't really so much, but still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  So in your first several months here, were you thinking about the big picture or were you determined just to get on with your new life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  No, I, there were two things, or three things. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Number one, I wanted to see if I could not get anyone out, but I had no money and the organization had very much trouble here, even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because they didn't want to be involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="550"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> got only involved in 1941 and the thing is, and, and, but everyone, every refugee, the refugees, they adored Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Later on they found out he wasn't that, not 100 percent, because whenever he got something to talk about the Jews in this conference, you see, he put it on the bottom, he didn't talk to 1t very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But on the other end, they didn't have anyone else to adore, so they adored him, pretty much and they thought he would save it in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I don't have to talk about history. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But when I wrote a poem I came here, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I was very much in favor of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I thought it was the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you see, where we could be able to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Hm? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It's the land of the future, you see, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Oh, this is your poem? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Why don't you read it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  I only want to read the last two paragraphs over here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Was it tough leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , even though you knew you had to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  As I said, my mother never wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , all the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , loved <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> very much, it's a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we traveled around there and it has nice sights and nice scenes and nice countrysides, but we saw there was no future in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Not only was there no future, you would, you would be killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So we left and we were leaving, just with the intention to find a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> , as I said here and to have more opportunity because there was no opportunity left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  When you were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ...
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  Were you thinking about the fact that you had, unfortunately lost your mother and she wasn't traveling with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  That was one thing, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But, but the further away we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the more we thought about new opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And of course we were sorry and sad for those people who couldn't come out and who we had left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But we couldn't think of very much because now we had to be on our own and make our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Some people left with money, very early in the 30's, but we left with no money, four dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  So, we digressed a bit, but you were on your way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and you had stopped at the New York World's Fair for a few days and what next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  Then we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and I called up the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I called up the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and they were very friendly, they said, "Take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and we'll pay for that," and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> brought me through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It was a very long trip, I never was in such a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , where I come from, is a much smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So I came there and they greeted me when I came in and they were very happy and I was happy to come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So I came there, I met some people whom I had seen before, especially this Rabbi Kalibar(ph) I met and many others and also the one who was the executive director, he's still there now. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I also had met in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , maybe his relatives, not him. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So it was different, so I very quickly got adjusted to it, they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> you see, with two, two other roommates. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It was on <span class="DLF">Garrison Boulevard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And I started learning there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Were there other Germans there or was it mostly just you mixed with Americans?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  But not other refugees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Not at that time, however, I saw in the newspaper, which they showed me, and I might have met them afterwards, I don't remember, they also were brought over by, by the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and _ in the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">My name was also in the newspaper that I'm someone else from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Then there was the Rabbi Schwab(ph), who recently passed away, he also came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I knew him from there and there were a few people of German origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Now, you were training to be a rabbi?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Then I was learning and I became a teacher, a principal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  So your intention when you were 17 was not necessarily to become a rabbi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  It was in the <span class="DLF">education field</span> , mainly.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But then I decided I want more in the <span class="DLF">educational field</span> than being a rabbi and later on I was also mainly in the <span class="DLF">educational field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Social work and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  Did you, did you have a congregation, I mean, did you practice as a rabbi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was at one time, I had a job in Mountaindale(ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , assistant rabbi and that was probably mainly it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  In an Orthodox congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Yeah, different <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but they were much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Because I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> from 1939 to 1945 and in 1944, I was ordained as a rabbi and I learned there many years, with many other people and during the war, I can tell you, during the war, even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I was considered an alien, what do they call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Enemy alien and I had to get permission to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , each time, from the Attorney General, it was a woman, I went to her many times, put a stamp in the passport or so, something like this, gave me a special card. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">When I traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I also needed special permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And I needed every year, an extension of my passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So now that comes to this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">All right, they had told me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , when you come there, get your passport extended, yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I go, I'm there. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So I said to myself, who can extend it, it was made out by the German government, go to the <span class="BUILDING">German consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">At that time, 1939, yeah, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> entered the war, I left, I left <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> on the fifth or sixth of September, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> entered the war at, on the seventh of September, September, day after. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So I came there, the <span class="BUILDING">German consulate</span> , at that time, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was not at war yet, so the Germans still had the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But I had no money to go there because it was 15 cents already at that time, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was five cents a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So I got the money, I went to the consul and I said to myself, "I have to be very careful when I go to these people." </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So I went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So they, so it was lunchtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I didn't know that they have lunchtime in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and that there is such long lunchtime and they go out and no one 1s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But there was someone there, so I said to him I wanted my passport extended if they can extend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They said, "Yes, leave the passport with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I said to myself, "No, I don't leave anything here." </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I take it with me and said, "I come back another time." </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I went to the Canadian consul, because I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and I said to him, "I cannot get this passport extended, but I only have permission here until February 21st, so if he cannot get permission for me, extension of the passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So he said to me, you see, and this is interesting that he made a mistake and that saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">He said to me, about, he did not ask me about domicile, he just said I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and he gave me permission to stay until June. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Did he give me permission? </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Then I had no more permission and he said he cannot give me permission any more because I wasn't in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and he has no longer authority to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I told them, "I came here on this passport that cannot be extended and I'm studying, I came here as a student and I cannot return to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> because I didn't gain domicile and I cannot return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because they are at war" and if I can stay here longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So he gave me, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> gave me permission for one more year and they waived my passport requirements and every year, only every year I had to write to them for another year extension and that I did until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And then at the end of the war, I made a, during the war I made a request to become a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was 1943, but I couldn't become a citizen at that time because it was the height of the war, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He said, "Did you do anything for the war effort?" </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So what could I do, I wasn't in the army, but I bought war bonds, but that wasn't enough, so they said, "No, you cannot become a citizen now, but after six months, you can reapply." </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So I reapplied again after six months and the situation got better, then I got the FBI to help me and finally, in 1945, I got what's called first papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">At that time there were first papers and second papers, now you can right away become a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Anyhow I had to wait five years in between and then in 1951, I became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">When I became a citizen, I changed my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Why did I change my name? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">First of all, my wife didn't like this name, in the meantime I got married, 1948, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"> New York</span> I got married, because I didn't tell you that after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So I said, this is a Russian name and people cannot pronounce it and I cut off the beginning and the head and the tail, like, like a herring and I keep the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">The middle is Wein and I don't like one name, one syllable names, so make it Weiner, so they make my name Weiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">It's in my naturalization papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">During the war, I tried to do many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I tried to be and I was even, air raid warden too, at one time, but then they told me, you are an enemy alien, you cannot be an air raid warden, so okay, I said okay, ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">~ During the war, I also went to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> to learn English and I had a very famous governor of <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , who was a teacher, McKelton(ph), I don't know if you heard of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He was a tall man and he used to say a word, he said, "Winners are never quitters, quitters are never winners. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So go on with what you want to do, don't quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">If you quit, you cannot win. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Winners are never quitters, quitters are never winners." </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So I liked that and many other story, but that's not about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and then in 1944 when I got ordination, _______, [had many friends there, I met other people too. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I was working also with the Agoutis(ph) Historic movement there and I, groups of children and to others and I send children to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in summer and so forth, I did this all there and I instituted something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , three things I instituted there because I thought, it is in the American heir that they are a little bit, so big, at least it was at that time, to be a little bit more distant. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So I wanted the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> to be a little bit closer, so I arranged something, they had only a loan fund, so I said, There are some people who cannot pay back a loan, we make it the charity fund and give out forthwith, money." </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Number two, I made arrangements with the doctors who would give free service to the Yeshiva boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Number three, I arranged with some people to give clothing, free clothing, at that time people took second- hand clothing, today they don't take it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Number four, I arranged in the morning to wake them up, <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> through those ———_—«.~ Number five, I instituted a fund for medicines, because at that time everyone had to buy medicine, no one could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I said, if you join this club for 10 cents a month, 10 cents, we give you aspirin or whatever you need and Number five, Number six, I institute something on the end of Shabbat, to make, to invite certain number of people and to have them give a little talk and since we invited only certain kinds of people, only, we invited only certain numbers, so everyone wanted to be invited, so they came around. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And I'm still friends with some of these people who took over, one of them is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , Rabbi Rosh Hasheva(ph) and | too, a good friend of his.</span></p>

id="706">I wanted to move at a time when I can still walk on my two feet, before I get too old and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  Why did you choose the kind of work, which really you made your life's work, with Social Services and then an education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Because I, for two or three reasons, number one, I'm interested in education and in learning more, like the perennial student, who always wants to learn more and I study a lot, with books and other things and I wanted to bring the people closer together. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And, family life and, it's much easier, I wrote in my book too, it's much easier to learn how to hate than to love and then to be together and I know, there's so much, so many bad things happening in the world, with drugs, with crimes, all kinds of things, but we have to get in positive outlook to everyone, we have to do something which is positive, which helps to advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Hate only brings you down and you have to bring something out, you see, which advances you, brings you closer together. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I like to know people and what kind of life they have and what kind of life they made for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And when I gave them advice, I always gave them advice to do something positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I even tell them, if they are not successful in one <span class="NPIP">subject</span> , not to stay with it, to go into another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I had a typist once who didn't know how to type, so I helped him into another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">See, if you just let them go and you don't show any concern for it, it doesn't cause for good relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  How much d 0 you think that the choices you made reflected your earlier experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  First of all, I saw the relationship in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and also with my family and I saw also with other people that if they were close together, 1t was more successful and more helpful to them than if they were separate or hating each other or doing something which was negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I don't really know anything else, it must be in the genes of a person, you see, to do certain things, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  I mean, I have to think that some of the choices you made after the war, your value system, had to have been affected by your experience in Nazi Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  I'm trying to, and you've probably thought about this...
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  Somewhat, to try and get a sense of how those early, very, very difficult early experiences, affected the way you are today, the way you became, the way you lived your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">When I left the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , I went to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> until 1936, the teacher asked us to write down what we want to do after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and why we want to do it after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So there were two things which interest me, number one, I figured out if I would stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what would be possible, what would be open to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">There was nothing opened to me, not in the non-German world, only in the Jewish world. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So I decided to go to the Jewish teacher's seminary. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">In fact my teacher helped me select that. __</span><span class="sentence" id="737">|_ number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Number two was, I saw many people suffering in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Jews especially and, so I thought I wanted to help them somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Because they have, they have the same fate, they have the same fate that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">That's what I think it 1s, it might be more, but at this moment I cannot think of anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I might come to think of more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  When you moved over here, what did you see as your greatest challenge, as your difficulties, if any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Before we moved over here, we had to make a decision when we want to move and where we want to move to. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">When we want to move to I already told you, I wanted to move when we are, still can work and do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I did not want to retire completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">When I gave my retirement speech in the Department of Social Services, I said to them, "Retire means to put on a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tire</span> , to put on a new career. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Retirement means a new career and people in their retirement usually are more busy than before." </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Where we want to move to. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So my son, who lives in <span class="REGION">New York state</span> , I didn't want to move there, because they have a lot of business to do with themselves, they have their own family and they wouldn't have any time for us, not that I want people to have time for me, but they're busy with themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The second reason I didn't want to move there is, there wouldn't be any chance for me to do something else, to get a job for something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="751"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , my daughter lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I didn't want to move there, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> climate is too cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So we moved here. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">That's our youngest daughter, she is here, living here and I think we could give her some help and also here would be the possibility to get another job and I got some other jobs here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  But actually what I was trying to understand is, in your moving not so much to the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span> , but to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know, a long, 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">What, over the years do you think has been more difficult or more challenging for you in terms of adapting to the American lifestyle. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I mean I know it's a long time now, but if you can think back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Do mean that originally why we wanted to come to the United ...
QUESTION:  No, not why you wanted to come, but once you were here and living here, what, do you remember what ...
ANSWER:  What was most difficult to adjust to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  Or most challenging for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  First of all, there were already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time when we came here, there were already groups of equally minded, equal minded Jews, were already living here. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">There were already <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> , certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> and therefore it made it easier for me and therefore I might be able to find a job through them and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And there is more possibility and opportunity here than other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was not as hard, as difficult to find connections, see and to study and learn something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  So what you're saying is adjustment really wasn't that difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  No, well, not too difficult here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  Do you think that there were certain events 1n the history of the last 50 years, that impacted you or that you thought about in a different way because of your experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Whether it was the McCarthy hearings or the Civil Rights movement or even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Japanese internment centers</span> , I mean were there events here that you had a particular, particularly strong reaction to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  Yeah, for instance, as I mentioned before, during the war...
QUESTION:  You don't have to be so close to the mike, but you keep turning your head away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">During the war, that we were considered enemy aliens, despite the fact that we were saving, they were not, they did not make a differentiation between those who came here because of their own personal persecution and those who were actually went along with the Nazi system. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They didn't make any difference here, they just considered everyone who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the same category, the Japanese too. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">That was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And then, afterwards, I mean the McCarthy hearings and so forth, the un-American committee, see that it's not American again, not too much American. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I mean that was a, a leftover, I would say, from what the thinking was here in the beginning of the 40's. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Is means that they very much believed in, in pure American and anything which came from outside of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , like <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and the Communists and so forth, was considered, you cannot live with it and you have to fight it. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So I think, but then the people understood that the most important here is actually to do something for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , when Kennedy, when Kennedy came. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I don't know if this is the right answer, there is no right answer to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  That's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I'm just sort of wondering if there were certain events over the years that had a very unusually strong impact on you and, or that you identified with or that made you think in a new way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">At one point, at one point I could have gotten a job, I was even offered a job already, in <span class="REGION">Portland Oregon</span> , I was offered a job, in 19, 1956 and I got the contract in and everything like this and I thought everything would be okay and I would be able to do this, to go there, to start a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and certain other things and I discussed it with some of the friends here and some intelligent people, if this is <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that's reliable, if I can believe it and they said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But what happened is, I made already arrangements for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to go there and the condition was, my condition, that I would go there for three months on trial and if I like it, I stay, if I don't, and fulfill the complete contract, if not I would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But just the day before I was leaving, I was told that they changed their mind there and they don't want to make a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, they want to make some kind of a social program or who knows what there and I had already given up my job, which I had here. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I had two jobs, I had the job in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and I had the job in the <span class="BUILDING">burlap factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And fortunately, the <span class="BUILDING">burlap factory</span> , they took me back right away, even though I had canceled with them, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> did not take me back, but I didn't mind and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , the one who had signed the contract gave me 50 dollars, which was not very much for the whole contract, which they signed, so then I decided, I'm not going into this <span class="DLF">field</span> any more, because you cannot believe them and I wanted to go on something which was safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Then I found out about the city of New York and I went into the Social Work System with the city of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  Now, when you said, a few minutes ago you mentioned Kennedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  Why did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Because Kennedy, in his speech, especially the first speech we'd seen, don't do what the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> wants from you, do what you can do for your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you see, that people should work more for each other instead of against each other and always expecting things coming to them, you have to in, put some input, you have to do something and I wanted some input also, not all, that's why I wanted to make my own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my this and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Some input, not just just on the receiving end. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">This is unfortunately, naturally, people like to be served, but that's not how we can build up something. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">So that's just the kind of input, and when I came here, for instance, that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , they didn't have a certain class, so I instituted a class there. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">When I came here, they didn't have a certain kind of information sheet, so I instituted an information sheet. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> , they did not have a newsletter all the time, so we instituted a newsletter and ___ to the ______ and we told them some stories about, I would like some input. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Giving something see, more giving than taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  What, do you feel, as a Jew, absolutely safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  Safe in what respect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  That, that not, that what happened 50 years ago would never happen again, that you are free from anti-Semitism, whether institutional or personal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  You can never feel 100 percent safe, you can only, as an actual thing, you cannot be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">In your mind you can feel safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">You can say, I have done what I do, what I've wanted to do and I have done this and that's how it will go, it will be, it will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Things may change, things change all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The only constant in this world is change. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">So it will constantly change and I don't think that anti-Semitism will ever stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Because I see it, whether it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , whether it's all over, you see, there are always people who are very self-centered and they want just what they want and they do whatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people, hurting other people or harming or killing other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So therefore, I can only feel safe in the way, what I'm doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">If you believe in a certain thing, you believe in this and then you feel safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  Do you think that, that Jews need to remain vigilant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Vigilant? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Only so certain respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Let's say 1f someone is a very fanatic, it wouldn't help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">You can only be, be vigilant in your own approach and what you are doing yourself, not vigilant in respect to, in regard to other people, that will not help very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Because one war brings upon another war __, like it was in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">First the war of 1870 brought about the war of 1914, brought about the war 1939 and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So one war brings about another war, so to bring about peace you see, that's actually what our intent is, the intent. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Everyone talks about peace, but no one does anything about it, like the weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">It doesn't happen in the world today. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We have many arenas of war and people talk about peace and it continues. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , all over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this, in terms of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">You left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939, you knew if was scary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  You knew it wasn't getting better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  But I suspect you had no idea what you would learn later. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">That must have been somewhat shocking to you, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I mean what would you, when you finally learned what really happened over there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  You cannot always think of the worst, you, you think something will happen you see, how much will happen, I don't know and then you have to be guided, like I did, by some principal which is basic, by some basic principal which you believe by. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">If someone has a belief, then he knows something, then he, then he, then he feels safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">If someone had religion, for instance, he says, this 1s what I can do, so much I can do and not more and the rest I may, I may leave up to God or someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I can do only my best, what I can do and every person's limited, can only do certain thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So I will try my best. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But then you really have to try your best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  But I think what I was asking is, when you got tangible information about the atrocities in Europe, what was the impact on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  I felt very bad about what was happening and I felt that something had to be done about it and the question, who could do something about it and how can you help, but it 1s not up to one person, it has to be a group of people and before you change any person's, before you can change any person, before you can ask any person to help you, he has to have in his mind that he wants to help, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So you have to find out what is in his mind, you know and by talking to them and how bad it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Many people didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And I see it many times, there are still people today who don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">People only believe it if it hurts themself, if 1t hits themself, hits them or their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So therefore, I think the most important thing 1s education and therefore I was always 1n the <span class="DLF">educational field</span> , I wanted to be in the <span class="DLF">educational field</span> , because the work education means to bring out ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Not revolution by force, but to bring it out for other person, every person has something unique in themself, which other person doesn't have and bring this out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  Was there a sense of celebration or satisfaction 1n the birth of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or 1s that just something that you...
ANSWER:  It was a momentary victory, momentary, because... [end of side one, tape three]
QUESTION:  What we were, you know, I was just asking you about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and you... Let me ask you, I mean clearly your religion has always been important to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Do you think that it helps you get through hard times, or that it affected the way you lived your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">ANSWER:  I think it helped me lot of times and I also think that it helped me, not to get too involved or too much engrossed in thinking that this is very good, it wouldn't change. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">There is still, there is still things that will change and not that this is a final answer, like what they are doing now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I don't think that will be the final answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">There's a progress going on, life 1s movement, it continuously moves. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It was good at that time, for instance, that many people needed someplace to live and this was provided. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">But, as they saw in German, that the most pious person cannot live in peace if the evil neighbor doesn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">That's what Goyter(ph) said, he was a great German poet. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So you have to live with others together and sometimes the others don't want peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  When you were living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> still and there was really a constant fear of not knowing what was going to happen next, did you pray a lot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  You see, in the beginning, as I mentioned, I only became more religious after my bar mitzvah, even though we kept chabiss(ph) to a certain extent and my mother kept kosher food, <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , but in wasn't such a problem, you see, we didn't think of it so much, we thought it would always remain like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Because I had friends, non-Jewish friends, we playing together and we didn't think of, so much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Neither did they think so much about it, the difference between Jews and non-Jews, until the Nazis came and made it a policy, everyone has to think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  How about after your Bar Mitzvah and times were getting worse then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  That you, when you, did you pray for a sense of support or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">ANSWER:  No, I said the regular prayers you see, what we always say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Nothing special?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION:  But you continued, you continued to pray and to believe in the value or the power of prayer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  Is there anything you can point to, that might explain what gave you special strength, special skills in, instinct, to get through all of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="867">That you carry with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  I know one thing, that, I was the first born in the family, you see and usually the first born, gets more attention from the parents, like in my case and they sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of higher learning and they gave me piano lessons training. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Not my sister, she always complained about this and so, so in order to give them a kind of feeling you see, of a little bit more than someone else, because like honoring your parents, you respect your older brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But I didn't take advantage of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Probably it made me feel a little bit, a little better, I don't know, you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  It may have made you a little bit more of an activist, of a leader, which it seemed like you were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  When you think back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , are there any images that still stick with you, that haunt you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  As I said, no I didn't say it but...
QUESTION:  But now you will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  As you know, my wife doesn't want to have any connection any more with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I say, there were certain things in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which were very nice, you see and we would, and I would like to see it, I would like, let's say, for instance, go back and see where I was born and where we used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">In fact we once went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , since, since we immigrated here, but that was only one day, but I don't know what the German mind is now, but I remember one thing, that after the war, our neighbor, non-Jewish neighbors, wrote to my father a lot and they and I still have the letters, in German, that they were good friends and they are sorry for what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so forth and of course they wrote, also said, they suffered a lot, but that's not comparable to what the Jews suffered, because anyone else, even I tell most of the young people, too, anyone else who suffered, if he would accept the Nazi policy, would not be persecuted any more, Jews were persecuted whether they did or not and it was a purpose, so therefore I'd like to know, what the German attitude is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">When they asked me this question in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , you see, how I feel, I ask them how do you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">QUESTION:  Do you ever dream about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  No, not any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  When you did, were there certain recurring images?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  It was only during the war that I dreamt about some people I knew and I didn't know what would happen to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  Now, your wife is also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Besides the fact that she's a lovely, wonderful, woman, was there a certain commonality, a certain bond that you felt because she was also a German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  No, because I met her when we were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , she did not remember this, but I did, do. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Because when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">Wurzberger school</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> , at one time, in the last year, 1938, beginning of 1938, they wanted a foreign language to be taught and the question was, do you want Spanish or French. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">The majority wanted Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">After the majority wanted Spanish, they asked, is there anyone who can teach Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I had had correspondence with <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , a friend of mine, so I knew a little bit of Spanish, so I said, I'll try to give a Spanish course. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So I was appointed the first Spanish teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And in order to make it applicable and have people join this course, I gave a sample lecture in a big <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> and she was one of the students there. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">She didn't even know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And then we met again when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  Well the reason I ask is that it seems a lot of survivors marry survivors, a lot of survivors from one area in Europe, later marry somebody from that same area of Europe and I'm wondering if there's a logical reason for that and why you wouldn't have necessarily married somebody who was American, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">ANSWER:  No, there, and a few reasons for it, number one, first of all, people like to marry someone who, with whom they can converse, I mean, who is on their level and maybe even intellectually, culturally and so forth and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , my wife had an aunt there who knew this family, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">In fact I knew some, I knew of a cousin of my wife's, whom I liked, but she was killed in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And then one day when my wife came here, she made the contact and, so that's, we had met before as I said, but not knowing it and that's how it came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  So it wasn't a matter of either more comfort there or less comfort with somebody who doesn't understand where you came from and what you went through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is true, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless someone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , or go to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> and marry there, but usually they try to find someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Also I liked her family and the family gave me some, something, yeah, helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being surprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in Europe and they didn't care and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want to spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  You know, that's the thing __—__was trying to get at.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  I guess I have one more question. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Do you think there's any way that the Holocaust could have been avoided?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  Not the way in which the German government operated at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Because in the 20's, when they wanted to establish a democracy in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , ___ a democracy, most people were not in favor of this democracy, or they didn't care and therefore, one government after the other fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">That was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Number two was, the Treaty of Versailles, in 1918, 1919, did not intend to create a United Nations, or what we have now, in the League of Nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">They did not want to, they did not want to bring people closer, but they wanted to separate people and they made different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , small <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , which didn't exist before. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They made this a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , this a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they made all different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , before it was all united. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And all this encouraged someone like Hitler to bring them together again and to tell the people, you see, don't worry about it, you are not treated well, the Versailles Treaty didn't treat you well and there's inflation and you can't get anything, no jobs, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I will bring the sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But he could only do this by having a scapegoat and he took the Jews, because the Jews are very, very passive in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So therefore, from this point of view, giving him the power, people gave him the power, so that Holocaust came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">QUESTION:  And the passivity of the Jews, did it play into this? </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Should they have resisted more strongly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  No, the Jews don't resist, you see, the Jews try to go along with the government, whatever the government is. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">In fact, even here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , after Truman I think, they mention the name of the president in every prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Roosevelt especially, Truman. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">After Truman, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">They did not want to, they accepted whatever, whatever the government said. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Pray for the welfare of the government, so they accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">What should they have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="928">What should they have done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  Is there something wrong 1n our teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  It has to be honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">The first thing that happened, what Hitler did, it was in education. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">He changed the, all the pictures in the books of the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and who knows what and put in the Jews with the big nose and with hook and this kind of thing and such a person you have to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">You can put everything into a child's mind, a child doesn't know the difference between right and wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They learned this only much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So therefore, if a child does not get the right information from the beginning, everything goes wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And that's why this sof the ——___ and other things, taught them wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Education is very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">QUESTION:  But what about our education as Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="939">To make us stand up a little bit quicker?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  What should they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="941">The Jews education does not, does not emphasize war or things of this sort, or hate or, even the Christian religion you see, says love your neighbor like yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And many religions teach, say this, but the difference 1s, we say and I don't know if I should say it, but we say, that's a way to act, not that's a way to think only. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Roosevelt said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Roosevelt knew only in mind, but not in action. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Same thing also with religion you see, to love your neighbor like yourself in your mind, yes, but in your action, not. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">The action has to follow what you say in your mind, if not so, not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So that's what they have to teach the children here, to really act, to be together, to be friends with each other and so forth, to have more kind of realistic system, not just in your mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Well, getting back to your saying that Jews as a people are passive...
ANSWER:  It seems so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  They're supportive of their community or their government, that they're passive. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Should we be less passive, should we be more attentive to what's going on and act?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  There are certain, in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> in which you should not be passive, but that I cannot say and make everyone responsible for, that 1s, there are certain laws, let's say the 10 Commandments, you see, they should be more active in those, not to kill, not to steal and so forth, you see, and just be more active in that, not only the Jews, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Because what's going on now with the drug scene, with the killing and so forth, they don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So, so there are certain, certain laws which, which every person should understand, logically. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And that they should teach them and not only teach them to think about this, I want to, I don't want to preach here, you see, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  I don't have any other questions, is there something you would like to add, that I haven't asked you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">ANSWER:  Except, I don't know if I gave you everything, because it's impossible, there are too many things to be remembered and too many things which happened, but, if you want to build a world of peace, that all people want to do now, at least they say so, then, then we have to, then we have to give everyone the equal opportunity, but it's unfortunate that many times, as soon as someone gets a little bit higher, he wants the whole, he wants everything you see, people aren't satisfied with a finger, they want the whole hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And, we wrote once, an essay, we _ wrote an essay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> and the essay was called, German loyalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">The Germans were always loyal to their leader, not only were they loyal to their leader, also they wanted to be on top of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And they believed in the Darwin theory, the survival of the fittest, we have to be the fittest, the Germans said. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Now if everyone thinks I'm the fittest and he will always subdue other ones and have weaker ones whom he destroys and that's what I want to end with. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">The teacher once, once asked me, he brought it out in a class and he said, "The Germans are superior and all the other races are inferior, because we are the strongest, we are the tallest, we are the blondest, we have the bluest eyes,” and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And, and he said to me, this was a Nazi teacher, "What do you think about it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I said to him, "There is nothing in this world superior or inferior, everyone can rise to a high level, everyone can go low. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">But there is one thing in this world which the Nazis don't recognize and that's that every person's different and you don't realize the difference between one person, everyone contributes something you see and you cannot put him down because he's different and him down because he's different in this way and he's different in that way." </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Same thing like happens in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Everyone's different, they can all contribute and as long as they contrib, as long as someone thinks I am superior and you are inferior, I am a majority and you are a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Once a person in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> told me, "The Jews are not a minority," he said to me. "</span><span class="sentence" id="968">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , " I said, but maybe another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So I asked him, "When does a minority stop to be a minority? </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">He couldn't answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">But someone's, if someone works under the logical thinking that he's a minority, then he will always strive to be a majority, we always strive to majority and there will always be a fight going on, but the only time someone thinks I'm different, I have certain things which you don't have and you have certain things which I don't have, then they will live together in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Accept it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">QUESTION:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">You mentioned a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> and I'm wondering at what point you were in a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  I think I made a mistake, it should not be called <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> , but <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Because when Hitler came to power, all the previous directors and teachers were either asked to become members of the Nazi party, or leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So the director in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where I went, the , had been with the Social Democrat party and he was dismissed. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And from then on, there were two kinds of teachers, the teachers who were members of the party from long time ago, the early numbers, all the early numbers had priority or a later number. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But they came all in with the Nazi emblem, which was like a lifesaver and there was written NASDP, National Socialist Democratic Workers Party, that's how they called themselves, with a swastika in the middle and one teacher came in with a Nazi uniform and whenever a teacher came in, the students get up and says Heil Hitler, when the teacher leaves the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , Heil Hitler, they all stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">But that was, that was already before that they would stand up, but that was respect for the teacher, because you were, you were supposed to have respect for the teacher, the teacher was a high official in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">QUESTION:  So this was in 1933 and did you, what, did you stand up, did you have to stand up to salute
ANSWER:  I stand up, but I did not have to lift the hand with the Heil Hitler salute or the Nazi salute, but there was, when you came into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , there was a teacher standing and everyone when he came in, would lift his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I didn't have to lift my hand, but then on the other hand, some people who didn't know it, would beat you up if you didn't do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  Were you ever beaten up?</span></p>
