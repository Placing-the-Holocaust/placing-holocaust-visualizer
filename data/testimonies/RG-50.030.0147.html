<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION: Now, we'd like you to tell us your name and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER: My name is Emanuel Mandel. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> in the country of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> in 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION: 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And you've said that where you were born is not really important to the story, so would you describe your family and perhaps your earliest memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER: I said that it is not important to my story because uh there was an old adage that said you must be born where your mother is, and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> at the time because my father had a position in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">As a matter of fact, he was about to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and they were just waiting for me to arrive, and when I was, I'm told, perhaps three months old or so, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and never to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I've never been there since. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I would say that my earliest recollections are probably three or four years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh, and none of them are in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They are later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> further. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">As we moved, as the war came, other recollections come up in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION: Well, let's start at your earliest recollections, and describe your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">What, who, who made up your family and where did you live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER: My family consisted at the time of, a small family, I'm an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Uh, my parents had a son before I was born, some three years before, who was born healthy according to the pediatrics of the time and at the age of ten weeks died, probably from some problem that in this day and age could have been handled uh very simply in any <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But that was 1933 and even though they were in major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> with major medical knowledge available, it could not save the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I came in 1936 and I was the only child to my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh, to, to flesh out in a sense the information about them, my father is alive and well, lives in the city of Philadelphia. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He is 85, just turned 85 this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My mother died uh in 1967 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> of causes unrelated to anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was a disease and uh, she died quickly, at a rather young age, just under 60. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I, uh, as I say, since I have no siblings, the family is kind of limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">If I were to give you background about the family itself, uh my father comes from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which was, at the time that he was born in 1904, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , maybe <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> , or maybe even <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , because the way the <span class="DLF">borders</span> were moved at the time nobody really knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">His passport was Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">His citizenship was Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The part of the <span class="REGION">land</span> was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austro-Hungary</span> , and his language is Hungarian, so it is difficult to determine. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Legally, he was Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He served in the Czech Army and when he was 19 or 20 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But he never identified as a Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">There's a document that I gave a copy of a little while ago, which is a Czech passport, which was, uh the pictures in the document are probably from 1939, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I'm a young child but I'm still a Czech citizen on my father's papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My father was raised in that general <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> which is in...east of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> --in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruthenia</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Today it's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumania</span> , as a matter of fact; so it's moved again. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But he was raised there; and his travels took him to many <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but maybe you'll want to come back to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My mother is from another part of the Austro-Hungary empire, that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which was really Yugoslav. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">She's from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="REGION">southern Hungary</span> which today is <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And just to indicate the confusion, it had three names - one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serb</span> , one in Hungarian, and one in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And people wouldn't know how to refer to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities--</span> whether you called them Ujvidék in Hungarian, or Neusatz in German, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She was raised there, in a family of uh six children, three boys and three girls, and my father met her in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and again we may want to come to his story, at least parts of it, as you want to pursue that. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION: Why don't you tell it to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER: !</span><span class="sentence" id="43">'d be glad to. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Well, uh, my father was educated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and eventually took a position in the city of Novi Sad where my mother lived, met her and they married and from there they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to another position my father had, and that's why I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">From there he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which was something he wanted to do all his life, but the pattern of migration at that time was by choice, well, semi-choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He wanted to do this because he was trying to get to a certain particular position in his life, but he also was constrained from getting to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> until 1940, uh, 1936, because as a Czech citizen, we go back to the old Czech citizenship, he could get no, he could not receive working papers or whatever permission to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , as a Czech citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In '36 he received it, so he went from part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , after all these various detours, in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">If that's confusing, I can understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  What was his position? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">What was his work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER: My father was a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My father was a cantor in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and has been that all his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And he had positions in major <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And in order to be able to move in his own <span class="DLF">field</span> , he had certain positions that he wanted to reach. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And a cantor in the city of Budapest, in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that held 3500 seats with a choir of 40 people, was a major position, and he wanted that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But he didn't have permission to go there until '36.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER: He was a Czech citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And the Czech citizens were not given Hungarian working papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So the pattern of migration was not because he was either a Jew or because he, the war came. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">This was before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There may have been some overtones of that, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But very legally he was not permitted to get papers until '36 at which point he did assume the position of being one of the chief cantors of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , which was a major Jewish community center in <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION: Are you aware of any changes in your family's life when Hitler came to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, "Hitler came to power" needs to be addressed in terms of when - whether when he came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or as his power began to reach out throughout Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And what time are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION: Whenever it affected you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER: Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Hitler comes to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the laws, the various laws that are passed, the uh... I think there's a term called "Numerus Clausus." </span><span class="sentence" id="71">These various enumerated clauses that were passed to restrict certain life began way back probably in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And they came, as history indicates, it's not germane to my particular story - it's available in lots of papers - that most of what happened was very legal, very correct, and did everything according to the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now, if you want recollections from me for example, I know that uh one day, this was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the capital of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in a very lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , on the fifth floor of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I had lived which I recall quite clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As a matter of fact, for the first time in forty some years I visited it last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">My wife and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Didn't go in because I didn't want to bother the people and there was nobody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is now probably 80 or 90 years old - it's in reasonable shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But in 1940 or so, 1938, it was a very lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I remember that one day, I can't tell you which year, but some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in that general period, in '39, '40, '41, a telephone installer came in and said that he must take the telephone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I remember asking why, whether I asked him or my parents I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He said Jews may not have telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Period. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Another incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh, we had a maid, a live-in-maid - there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's quarters</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , that was very usual in those days, in those circumstances, and uh, she was told she could no longer be with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She wanted to take me with her to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My parents thought about it, chose not to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But maids could not be employed by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So the maid left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION: Why would she have taken you to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER: Well, she thought she would in some way help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Or maybe save me, or maybe protect me, or maybe help me, or raise me in a sense, because there were overtones of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh, I recall rather clearly that as a child of 5 or 6 or so I wanted a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Not an unusual request, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for a child of 5 or 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My parents were certainly in a position to afford a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But there was major concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I didn't understand the concern at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I just understood I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I probably threw the normal 5-year-old-tantrums about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Later on I kind of understood that one of the reasons was that in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you ride <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> in a <span class="DLF">park</span> , and in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , large, urbane, sophisticated as it was, if a child with a yellow star on his chest rode a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , somebody might have knocked him off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , taken the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and left him on the <span class="DLF">curb</span> , and nobody really would have said too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And my parents thought it was just unsafe. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Not unsafe in terms of the kinds of problems you might have because of traffic, but just unsafe. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I know that when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we had was on a corner of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - you could see down the <span class="DLF">street</span> if you stood in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , there was a circular kind of a set of <span class="DLF">windows</span> - and the <span class="DLF">street</span> I lived on, my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was number at 13, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was at number 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You could see from the fifth floor <span class="DLF">apartment window</span> at number 13 to number 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You could almost see the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was down the <span class="DLF">street</span> several blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I didn't know this but I was told that my father, for example, often would both watch me walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and sometimes follow me walking to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because of some safety concerns that the kid might be knocked into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Nobody would have necessarily said too much if a child age six or seven with a yellow star would be pushed into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Accidentally or deliberately by somebody who was trying to make an incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">These are certainly things that in some way affected my life as a child, and uh, hindsight is always perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Part of what I find fascinating in my own case is that I have very good recollections. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But the time that this took place I didn't have the emotional impact of what this meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I learned that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">A six year old doesn't understand political realities, doesn't understand various kinds of anti- this or anti- that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Uh, to a 6 year old, in a rather peculiar way, wearing a yellow star makes him an adult.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="114">All the adults do. "</span><span class="sentence" id="115">Well, if they do and I don't, I'm a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">If they do and I do, I'm an adult." </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There's a certain badge of honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They didn't understand the negative implications of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">To me, to be like an adult, I too have my own yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was an important achievement, of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">That sounds silly. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But we are talking about a 6-year old child. ' </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The yellow star was introduced in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> on March 29, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Mr. Mandel was wearing the star when he was 8 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION: Do you remember when you got your yellow star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER: The specific day, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But it must have been some time in uh ... Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was in a peculiar position. </span><span class="sentence" id="128"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , being an ally of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was not overrun. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I am reasonably certain that the reason I'm alive today is because I was not under German rule in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Now, the Hungarian Nazi Party, known as the Arrow Cross, was not what I would call benevolent. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">On the other hand... Shall we stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION: We're going to have to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER: I didn't want to pay attention to the flicker; but I figured when it went out, might as well stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION: Let's do this as quickly as we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER: Anything you want to say while we're off for a minute in terms of where we are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION: This is very interesting and important and exactly what we want to have on the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER: Well, is this the way you want to have it? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I have another variation, another canned speech, although some of it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I mean, I've done this before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION: ...breathing in my ear to tell you that she's terrific.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Well, I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Come on!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION: Go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER: I was commenting on the fact that one of the--if you want to call it an advantage, or one of the blessings in disguise--was that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was not occupied by the Germans until fairly late in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="146"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was an ally. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Again, historians know that the region of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was uh, struck some kind of ally pact with Hitler and they were allies, so Hungarian troops on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">As a consequence, the German presence, the physical presence of the Germans, specifically the SS and the Gestapo, did not enter <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> until very late in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Literally until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Earlier, the regime was run by the Hungarian Nazi Party--the so- called "Arrow Cross," the Nylas. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And their symbol was crossed arrows, as opposed to the swastika that the Germans had. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And as a consequence, the kind of life that one had was probably different. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I'm not sure it was any better; but life was certainly different than it would have been under German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION: When you were six, you said that you weren't aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Clearly, you weren't aware of these historical, political activities; but what about your friends, what about other six year-olds? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Were you aware of danger to yourself from other kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER: Well, I have the recollection of recalling at the age of six that I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Of kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I lived in a fairly closed society, by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean, we lived in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You remember, you realize that the kind of transport that's available today, the kind of mobility that we have today--not because of any sense of available conveyances... I mean, again, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You could go anywhere anytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But if you went anywhere that was more than an hour away, it was a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Emotionally, it was not the kind of thing people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">People did not go to visit their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Certainly, children did not go to visit their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And Mom didn't drive you over for the afternoon and pick you up three hours later while she went shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was not the norm. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We owned no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Few people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It's not a question of where you were in the status of the community, but it was not the thing that people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> , subways--as everybody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">As a consequence, the universe that one lives in is fairly limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Interestingly, I mentioned earlier that I was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> last summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I kind of walked my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , all eight or nine blocks of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was that limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It was my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was the <span class="DLF">park</span> , it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ice skating rink</span> , it was the <span class="DLF">Danube banks</span> where we used to take walks--which happened to be close to where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was the area of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the area of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">When we went to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> , or the circus, or to the <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> , or to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , those were excursions. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Children did not do that by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And in a sense, six or seven year-olds don't do it by themselves today, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So the nature of life was that 1t was a fairly closed, kind of fairly limited society, for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I was limited in my <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">No <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">This is not a ghetto limitation, a legal limitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I was limited in my <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I lived in the 7th District of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and I probably knew one quarter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">7th District</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And kids like I--Jews and non-Jews--probably living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">3rd District</span> , knew a quarter of their district. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was the nature of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , as everybody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I mean, if you were Catholic, you went to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">If you were Jewish, you went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">If you were something else--the term is "Reformed," meaning all Protestants--went to some <span class="BUILDING">Protestant schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I was with those children; and I recall having children in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I lived, around the corner from where I lived, who were my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I have no sense, Jews or non-Jews, and I have no sense of their being afraid, scared, or that they were impacted by the war anymore than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">At least, that's not my recollection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION: Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That's when you were six. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Let's proceed a little bit more chronologically. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Did you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> for all of your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER: From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , if we back up, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I spent the summer, or a kind of a long summer, with my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I'm told that I had some kind of a reaction to...some allergic reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I developed some kind of hives at the age of one, and I was not <span class="NPIP">inside</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I was out in the fresh air of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> for about six or eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But from that time until we actually were deported and left in 1945, I in fact lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The bulk of my life--I was eight when we left, so seven and a half years I spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">From 1936, in the early...late summer, until the summer of 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION: Tell me about being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">What led up to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER: Well, history tells it that at one time the Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in early 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Eichmann, as the man in charge of the solution to the Jewish problem, was attempting to solve the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He was approached--and the story is very complex. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But it's not my personal story. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I'm not going to detail all the issues about Eichmann and his negotiations with a man by the name of Joel Brand, who was sent to negotiate with the Allies, was arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Syria</span> , was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , and survived the war and died fairly recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Or a man by the name of Kasztner--a lawyer, a Hungarian lawyer, who negotiated with uh Eichmann--who then immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after the war and was assassinated there by some people who thought...by a person who thought that he had done something that was inappropriate, or there was a collaborator.” </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Those particular stories are well documented elsewhere. * </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Rezsé Kasztner was a Labor Zionist activist from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> who became the guiding spirit of the Specifically, there was an arrangement made based on the concept that Eichmann enunciated as a blood for merchandise, or blood for material, or blood for an exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The exchange proposal was that Eichmann wanted 10,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">western trucks</span> , to be used against the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> , and for that he would release one million people and stop the extermination in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">That didn't happen for many reasons, not the least of them being that the Allies would not give them the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and that they were not available, and the emissary was jailed in <span class="COUNTRY">Syria</span> [NB: <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> ], as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But there was a test group, essentially a group that was bartered, for serious money. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The European Jewish community, the Hungarian Jewish community, and the rich Jewish community, they had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And at that point, this is, we are talking about April/May of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Now, remember that the war ended in '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">The war was not going well for the Germans in '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And I would not be surprised if they had made some decisions that said that whatever they do they will do to in someway improve their positions, whether it was personal or national I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And an arrangement was made that some 1600 people would be assembled, would be placed on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and would be taken, I think... There were three choices that I recall--through <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , or through the <span class="REGION">Baltics</span> , or through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> --to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I think the final decision was to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And the ruse was--and the Germans, you see, would do anything as long as it was legal and properly stamped, documented, indexed, filed and in a good chronology. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It's amazing what kind of regimentation we were able to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The 1600 plus people primarily professed to claim to be displaced persons captured in <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> , because of the war; but they really had Palestinian papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Now, if you want to figure that one out, I mean, that's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But the point remains, as long as you could provide Palestinian papers as citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> under Zionist movement's Relief and Rescue Committee of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Kasztner apparently believed negotiation was the only <span class="DLF">avenue</span> for the rescue of Hungarian Jews, and sent Joel Brand to negotiate with Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">When Brand was detained by the British, Kasztner and Brand's wife took over the negotiations with Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">British mandate, no matter where they had been born they were Palestinians. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">If you could provide those papers, the Germans would accept; because it is part of understanding that you don't challenge the documentation. "</span><span class="sentence" id="238">If you say you are a Palestinian, we'll accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And if we accept it, we'll give you an exit visa." </span><span class="sentence" id="240">This was part of the arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">It had to be proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It had to be legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It didn't have to be correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Well, I was a Palestinian expatriate of some sort, and so was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Not my father - he was not part of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">These 1600 people that were composed of people from various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> --and substantially from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> --were assembled in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the purpose of being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It should look as a deportation; but they would really be deported through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , placed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to be repatriated in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , which is...which is their adopted <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My personal little group was my mother, myself; my uncle--who was my father's youngest brother--and another child. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And I need to digress just for a moment as to how this was composed. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">My mother and I got fairly reasonable. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and we were part of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We received at that point four <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> in this group, for my mother, myself, my uncle and a cousin...a first cousin of mine who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION: How did you receive these <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER: The allocations were made by decisions of the ruling Jewish community, council, party, Zionist underground, overground, leftist/rightist organizations who somehow got together and had to make decisions about who can, who cannot, who was healthy, who was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I would not really today wish to be in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But in many ways decisions had to be made as to who in fact can perhaps afford it, who's free to do it, who's free to travel, who's maybe absence would not in some way be taken inappropriate by the Germans, some security issues, they would not be absconding with funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The computers of today probably could not come up with enough variables to determine by what way these 1600 people were chosen, selected, permitted may be a better way of saying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But we had four <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My mother, myself, my uncle and a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The cousin was the son of one of my father's brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The child came to stay with us as this group was being organized, because his parents thought that he might, in some way, have a better chance with us through this group than being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The child did not speak Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was very interested in making points, bounty points, with the local administration; and he kept complaining about the fact that there's a child staying with us who does not speak Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Obviously, he's not Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Obviously, he doesn't belong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We were concerned that the child would be turned in to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We sent the child back. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I don't mean I, but we--my parents--sent the child back to his parents awaiting the formation of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The child was deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Three days before the group was about to leave, a woman came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a woman who was a very distant cousin on my mother's side through her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I mean, really not a blood relation. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">With her four year-old son. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And she said that "I understand that you have a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> available, because the other child is no longer available." </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We had been waiting for several weeks, perhaps a couple of months for them to form, to be given marching orders. "</span><span class="sentence" id="276">Take the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We'll take the risk." </span><span class="sentence" id="278">My mother took the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I had a brother for several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Uh, so this was the group of four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION: What about your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER: I need to make tangential comments. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">First of all, that the four year-old at the time--and I'll give you names. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">His name is...his name at that time was Ivan Fleishman (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="286">His name is Joash (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh, both his mother and father survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">All of them reunited in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">His father has since died. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Not of war causes, uh age causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">His mother is still alive, and she is still my quasi-aunt; and I saw her last summer when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">She 1s married, has several children, and is well. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">It's an amazing kind of a story of how he came into this, and how he probably was saved by being in this group with my mother, and my mother's willingness to accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The uncle who was with us was a student in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Budapest</span> , was about to be married to a woman from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> --the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungvar</span> , which is now no longer <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It's now in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzhgorod</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="297">° My aunt-to-be went back to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to make preparation for the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I think they'd gotten their...their non-religious, their...whatever, their civil license, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So she went back to arrange, and she was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">She went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The uncle was with us, and I'll tell you where he was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They reunited in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">There were...they had twin children. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Unfortunately, the uncle died of a heart attack at the age of 35 in 1948, 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But they made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Where was my father? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The Hungarian Jews...well, Jews were not conscripted into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But, again, because we were not overrun, what Hungarian Jews did, they were conscripted into labor battalions. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And they were ordered out to various kinds of duty, whether it was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , <span class="DLF">paving roads</span> , do working in <span class="DLF">mines</span> , and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I mean, physical kind of labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Uh, if <span class="DLF">trenches</span> had to be dug between the Germans and the Russians, the labor battalions dug the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They were shot from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">My father was in a labor battalion, no longer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ; and if he had in some way escaped that labor battalion to join us, he would have been clear, obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He would have been traced, he would have been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I don't know what all the consequences would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So he was not part of this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">My mother and my father were separated at that time, and we went one way and he went another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I already told you earlier he survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So at least we know what the final story is. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">° Slovak: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U_horod</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> located in what is now the <span class="REGION">Transcarpathian Oblast</span> of the <span class="REGION">Ukrainian SSR</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">This <span class="REGION">area</span> , then known as <span class="REGION">Carpathian Ruthenia</span> , was part of the <span class="REGION">Czechoslovak Republic</span> between 1918 and 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION: Now, it seems that we have made a little jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Let's try to fill in what we're missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You were what? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">About seven, at the time of the deportation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER: Um-hum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION: When did your father leave, and how was this explained to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It seems that you must have gradually become aware that things are not very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Well, I knew that things were not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But I did not... What I was saying to you before is that I understood what went on, in a sense of recalling and having kind of cognitive understanding of what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It's the emotional impact, the scarring that wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">My father was in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">His being gone for two weeks, a month, three days, was not at all unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I mean, I didn't understand exactly why. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But other fathers went, so why shouldn't he go? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There was nothing unusual about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was like being in the reserves, if you will; or having, in this...in this community we talk about government employees having TDY's--fairly long assignments in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> or other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> for two weeks, three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Even, you know, being in the Navy or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">There was nothing about it, 1t was so routinized. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Interestingly, I mentioned that my uncle who was with us was my father's youngest brother, had been a university student. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">When he was called to labor camp for the first tme--I remember as clearly as I'm sitting here today--I threw a wild fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">My grandmother, who lived with us at the time, fainted; because that was a first-time unique experience, that my Uncle David. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I mean, his friends came; and they had to report at some, whatever, <span class="BUILDING">induction station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And I was convinced I'll never see him again, and I was convinced that something's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">That was unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">That disturbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">My father's coming and going didn't, because from the age of three--my age of three--he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And then he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And then he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And then he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I had no predictable kind of understanding as to when he would be or wouldn't be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Uh, you know, the world did not at that point have -based , didn't have to take me to the game every Wednesday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I was perfectly used to the fact that he would be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh at times and at other times would not. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">When my uncle was taken, that was a particularly...that was particularly traumatic to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Because it was the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So, there was nothing unusual about my father not being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Unusual in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I don't know if I filled that <span class="DLF">gap</span> , but let me go on with the point of what happens at this deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Finally, the orders came that we would meet in a given <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And uh ...for the purpose of kind of forming the group; and we were in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I don't know exactly how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">This is in June of 1944. [</span><span class="sentence" id="366">PHRASES MISSING--Re: waiting in a large <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> ]... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">We were put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ; and these were the typical <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that you see in movies today. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> with some straw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION: Can you describe them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER: Well, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> are just plain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> with big <span class="DLF">doors</span> with wooden floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They were reasonably clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They had some straw on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They were not full of... Some had some residue of lime, or some other kind of chemical that had been transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But they were not full of cattle droppings, and uh in that sense they were O.K. The reason they used these because these were more available than uh - they could not haul coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They could not haul passengers, well, passengers. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">We were not passengers, we were freight. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And we were put into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , uh, I am told later there were...may have been as many as 80 people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , which made it very uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But survivable. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We were not there that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I don't know if they were sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They were certainly locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You could not open them from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But I'm not sure they were sealed with some kind of sealant material that you see sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">That happened in transports to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And we started by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> uh... I remember, and I've read in some of these pieces of information, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> really circled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for a day and the next morning we were back where we started from. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I understand that they really didn't know exactly what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I also understand that the notion was being trained to <span class="REGION">neutral Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was never contemplated by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> did begin to go north. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And the adults in the group, I mean, they had some sense of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I mean, everything was not a secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And if you went, depending on what direction you went, you had an idea of where you were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And the major fear was the awful fear of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was known in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I mean, it was known everywhere, including this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION: Did you know what that meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER: I, personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER: I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on a different route. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It went up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine Valley</span> ; and eventually wound up, we were told, for a rest stop, for kind of a showers and some rest and relaxation, and whatever--an R&R stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We were there a couple of days, in uh...south of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> --which is familiar as the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , which is a major railhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And perhaps 20 kilometers south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , was a...this new camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> 1s more known now than it was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We were marched to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Reasonably civilized treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Uh, people who were older, children, were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I remember, I was with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I was the man of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Here was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">My uncle was involved with some of the leadership of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">My mother and the eight year old, and this youngster who was four. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So I lugged the uh whatever suitcases we had, and I marched with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I suppose I must have had some subconscious understanding of my role in the family as being the only male with my father away. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And I said before that my father being away was not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But I'm not suggesting that it had no impact at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It was just something that was dis...not disturbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But I knew that he wasn't there; and I was the man of the family, of sorts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION: But leaving your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was unusual, and what did it seem to you was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER: This was a deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I mean, it's a contradiction in terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It was a deportation by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">We were willing to take our risk, our chance, with this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Even though on the German hand...1n German hands, and even though we weren't too sure that we could trust those decisions, we were willing to essentially accept this deportation as opposed to staying where we were and taking our chances there. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But people survived who stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So...don't know exactly how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So this was a deportation by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Now, remember when we left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ... I mean, usually if we went somewhere, my mother and father, or my mother or whatever, with a suitcase or two, went to my grandparents or something, we would take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Here we had a horse and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ; and I don't mean a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hansom cab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Kind of a horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , which was kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight wagon</span> --which was still used in Europe at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And we sat on that with our baggage; and I remember my mother saying to me something to the effect is, "Don't look at this as a happy adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I mean, we are being deported." </span><span class="sentence" id="437">As though she was saying, you're being deported - on the other hand, it's a deportation with an asterisk. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">That's a deportation maybe with some possibilities, or maybe it won't be as bad as traditional deportations could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We knew my grandparents, uncles and aunts had been deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We didn't know their fate, but we knew they were deported not by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We were being deported by choice because we joined the group by...with some choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So there's...there's an interesting kind of juxtaposition of being under SS guard by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But that's, in a sense, what this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">'Cause you didn't have to join the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The SS certainly didn't determine who went into the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION: Can you remember what the conditions were that made it preferable to take this risky step?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER: Well, we thought we were going to be taken to some port of debarkation and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That seemed like a much better choice than being bombed, or being deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And we didn't precisely know perhaps exactly what happened in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But we just had the assumption that since nobody has yet come back, it can't be too terribly nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION: Did you feel that you mother was afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER: Afraid in what way? </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Help me out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION: I'm trying to imagine what it would be like to leave my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as a very young child, and what my mother would be feeling or doing, what the atmosphere would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER: My mother's feelings, as I found out later, in a sense had to do with the fact that she was not just leaving her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That, they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Remember, they were married in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , I was born in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , we were now living in a third <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> in the space of six or seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So that was not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But I think separation from my father was a major point. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I mean, she at that point had to contemplate that maybe she'll never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Had she stayed, he would have at least, I expect, come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --as he had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">As it turned out, he never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> subsequent to that time; because by that time, although he was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> when we were deported, within several weeks he was in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And was there for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Eventually he came back right after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But this business of being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> three days and gone for a week, or being away for three weeks and <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for two days, no longer would have played. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And no one could have known that. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But if my mother thought about replicating or maintaining what was the status quo, the assumption would have been he would have come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as he had done before. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">She had to make a decision and to agree with the decision--his decision--in their communication; my uncle's insistence that if one can in someway be given a better chance, take the better chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Now her feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I go back to being, what...eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And there was a certain sense of excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But dulled excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It's difficult to convey what it feels like when you are talking about feelings at the age of eight in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The understanding of what a Holocaust is about was totally foreign to me at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I'm not sure an eight year-old can comprehend what it is that people killed, what <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> are like, and whether they exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Slowly I began to understand some of it, and I'll tell you about that in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The group that we were with eventually does leave, and we were headed north. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And we wind up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION: Leaves on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER: Yeah, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">The gathering point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , we leave on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We're on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going in a direction that is not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And we wind up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was unfamiliar to us, but we found that it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION: Was there food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER: Yes, but I don't know from where. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I know that when we left, we were told that we could pack certain basic essential belongings, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Maybe a backpack and a suitcase, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We were not... I mean, we certainly didn't take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and cutlery with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">The adults, you know, there's other people, and I was not one of them, must have in some way had a notion that they were going to be on the <span class="DLF">road</span> for some time and needed to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">What was packed I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Obviously they packed something, but I do know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">My mother packed three things. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">This is very unusual to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">She had with her a liter bottle of honey, a liter bottle of fat, like chicken fat, and a, I don't know, a five or six pound, several kilo, piece of some kind of bacon-like substance. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Now, bacon in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">A strictly kosher <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my father's background and my mother's background. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But somehow, by some dispensation, or by some foresight, they thought that's new, that nutritious, let's take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We can always not use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I don't know how they justified it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But there's a sense of survival that says you take what you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And we ate, I'm sure we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We had no malnutrition problems in the four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Nobody died. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I recall, for example, we stopped two or three days out. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">As I remember it was a cool pleasant evening, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were open and we kind of camped on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">There were little flap-top <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , but we slept <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on blankets and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It was perfectly O.K. And there was some kind of cooking going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But you ask me where the food came from, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Maybe it was provided by the folks who ran the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">You know, the German, maybe there was a, a, military mess backed up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and gave us certain food. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Sixteen hundred people you know require, you know, you can't pack it in a doggie bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But there was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I can't tell you from where. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">That's not part of my recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I see a march (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> which begin to notice is there's barbed wire, there's <span class="DLF">fences</span> , there's very big search lights, there's <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> and there's guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And that gives you the nature or the understanding that wait a minute, this is not, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Summit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And you talk and you understand and you're given rules and you're given restrictions and you're told not to go near the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and you're told not to do this, and maybe not to shout too much or maybe not to do this and not the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">A small recollection, not particularly ; but 1t happened while I am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> sometime in June, the summer is there and winter sets in. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The German winters are not particularly pleasant, uh you know, rain and snow and wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Before we left, again, think about the kind of perception or some kind of clairvoyance that sometimes people have. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Traditionally the people bought shoes at the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">If we bought shoes, we had the shoes made. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We didn't buy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You know, Thom McAnn wasn't available and neither was Florsheim. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">My mother had a pair of boots made for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Not high boots, kind of ankle boots, because the assumption was if we're going to be traveling away under circumstances unknown, maybe those kind of high-top kind of boots would be better than softer city shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The way shoes were made is that you glued the sole in some way, and then you put holes in, and then you put wooden dowels in it, and then you kind of at the bottom with these wooden dowels. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">You didn't sew them. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I don't know about shoe making but that's the way hand-crafted shoes were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They were not designed to go through muck and mire day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as the rainy season began, began, and we were told every four, every day at four o'clock there would be a roll call, a census taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We had to be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We had to be out at four. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The census takers could have counted, the roll could have been taken any time after four - five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We had to be out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">If it was muddy, it was muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">If it was mucky, it was mucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Well, the wooden dowels began to fall out of the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">My uncle, Uncle David, made some arrangements with some other people in our group to fix the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Now think about, it is a fascinating notion to know that some people brought cobbler tools with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Somebody was a cobbler. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Somebody fixed shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So you traded, uh for cigarettes, which was a legal barter, uh rate of exchange, for shoe repair. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">My shoes were repaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The dowels were replaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And then my uncle says to me, son, you can't run around anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Well, I understood what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He was a young man at the time, he was in his early thirties, his late twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But he says to his nephew, you can't run around. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">What will an eight year old do when he can't even run around? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I mean the only recreation is kind of run around and play tag and chase other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But if you run around your shoes fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">If your shoes fall apart, your feet get wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Your feet get wet, you get pneumonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You get pneumonia, you're taken to a <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You go to <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> , you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So if you don't want to die, don't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">That's a difficult concept (ph) for an eight year old to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I did get pneumonia, from some other <span class="NPIP">source</span> , and I spent some time in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , you know, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , but that's a recollection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION: How much do you recollect or remember about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER: I was, let me tell some recollections about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I just said to you that somebody set up a shoe-making shop. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Well, so there were several doctors with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Because when I had pneumonia, I remember the doctor--his name was Feldman--he was from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I had some recollections of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I was reminded of him recently in a different connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But who treated pneumonia as pneumonia could be treated at the time with mustard packs and other kinds of things, which were the regimen of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But somebody... So the doctor is a doctor, the cobbler was the cobbler. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I'm sure, although I don't recall specifically, somebody did something about repair of clothes, somebody was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And even more fascinating to me is the fact that within days I think, people were into business. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They set out to do business in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">You asked me how, where the food came from and I said people must have brought some. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I remember, for example, I remember very clearly, that while my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , before we were deported, we would ship him tins of pre-cooked food. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Cause it was much more nourishing than what he was receiving up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Now again I don't know too much about how you prepare canned food, but I do know that what you have to do is somehow to vacuum Seal it. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So tins had the tops cut off, you took it to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that made tins, aluminum cans, and they would put a new top and kind of vacuum it and seal it in someway. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And that could be shipped and it wouldn't go bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We had some of those with us, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So did others. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">From the notion of CARE packages to my father, we had some with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The sun was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">The weather was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And I recall clearly people with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">card tables</span> of some sort, out in the <span class="DLF">yards</span> , with hand-tooled jewelry-type things made of tin cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">As the tin cans were used, sparingly and lovingly and gently, they did not throw them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They made certain kinds of artifacts out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">What I'm saying to you is that the fascinating point comes from the fact that what happened immediately is that peoples' need to survive makes them want to create some sense of normalcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I don't know whether the people that did this craft were in that business before they left, much as I don't know whether the shoe-maker was in fact a shoe-maker or an attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I don't know what he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">But somehow the need to survive, the need to stabilize, the need to somehow put down a normal set of existence within barbed wire, within <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">turrets</span> with machine guns, within hot lights, within . . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">the people who told you be out at four in the morning and they may have shown up at ten in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I mean that was not normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But within this abnormal normalcy, there was an attempt to have normalcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">They decided to teach Hebrew and French. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I thought (ph) it would have been German. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">What occurs if later we're in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and after the war we might be repatriated, liberated to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , which was a neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , or to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , which is where we're headed in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">But we didn't have to teach Hungarian kids Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">People knew Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And there would have been nobody there who could teach them Turkish, you know, which would have been. . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">or Spanish because there may be no Spanish-speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But French was not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">My mother didn't teach French. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">My mother was a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">She was a teacher, an elementary school teacher, before she was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">She knew some French because in their training, typically in Europe people spoke three or four languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So teach them French. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Well, think about the inanity in a sense, or the, the peculiarity of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There's a <span class="BUILDING">French school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Now we didn't expect to be there for any length of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And what I'm describing to you about this normalcy really happened several days after we got there obviously because we thought we were going to be there for few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">One of the visual kinds of recollections that I have is that as we march into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there's a large sign--and you've seen this sign in documentaries--above the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> is "Arbeit Macht Frei"--"Work Makes You Free." </span><span class="sentence" id="618">If you work, it's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Our group, andas_——_—sS would say of the group, was not turned out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Maybe we were special group. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We came in as a transient group. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We came in as a special group. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The Red Cross...monitored us. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Eichmann had a personal stake in this one, we understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We, I don't mean we. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I [was] probably too young to work, typically as an eight year old; but they did not, they were not turned out to work every morning, which was the major reason that the starvation rate was limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We did not lose any human being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Nobody died. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Nobody died. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And I think that's correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And if there were deaths, there may have been one. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I don't recall the circumstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I now recall vaguely, and I cannot recall specifically, a young woman who did die. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I don't know exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I think she may have had... I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But if so, I mean, the mortality in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was well below what it should have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in a period of seven or eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Because, you see, we didn't leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They decided they have us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> there's a way to hold us in hostage. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Three hundred and some members of the six hundred plus...sixteen hundred plus group were, in fact, taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> within weeks and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I was not among that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The balance of the group--another, whatever...thirteen hundred or so--were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , by the Germans, based on additional —__—___ bribery. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">What else can you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="643">More money was raised, more money exchanged hands, more money was deposited. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Uh without talking about just, you know, kind of a... Without being nasty about what I'm not really interested in talking about, I would imagine that the...the post-war German wealth of <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> came from, partially from, those monies. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But we were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German train</span> ; again the Germans were uh meticulous in what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">When they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It may have run over bombed out <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , which I remember having a great fright about going over this <span class="DLF">bridge</span> is over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> or whatever else, which were heavily bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">We saw bombers every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="649"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , which is a near-by community, was a major railhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And the Allies were bombing the out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We saw Russian and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American airplanes</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It's interesting that when we read the history of the era today, we know that there was some discussion about bombing the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And then somebody said they couldn't do that because they couldn't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">There were aerial pictures of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , taken pictures of the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And conversely, I mean, I among others saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> --<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> with American markings, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> with Russian markings, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> --flying in formation towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> and towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , which was also a severely bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were there, but the bombs didn't fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Well, I'm glad they didn't fall on us in one sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">On the other hand, the notion that they couldn't bomb the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> leaves you... I mean, from personal experience, I...I challenge that statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">In any case, they took us, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to the German<span class="DLF">-Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trains</span> cannot run in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swiss trains</span> can't run in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , either. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">They are a different gauge, as I understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I'm no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...you know, I'm no authority on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">As I understand, the Swiss did this in order to make sure nobody can invade them by rail. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German train</span> came up on one side of the...of the...of the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , and we came out of these... These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">These were not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport cars</span> for cattle anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="667"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Passenger trains</span> --not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Amtrak</span> , but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668"><span class="INT_SPACE">Seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">We came out of these rather... And they were all...black-out had to be observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And some of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were smashed, you know, without particularly...they were not pullman cars. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But we came out of one <span class="NPIP">side</span> ; and crossed the <span class="DLF">platform</span> into these warm, lit, beautiful, typically Swiss-clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swiss trains</span> to be taken to the city of Saint Gallen,” to a <span class="BUILDING">high school gymnasium</span> , to a...a gathering point to be deloused. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">The first recollection I have of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> is that we were all deloused. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I don't know if everybody had...was in fact infested with lice; but that was the first thing that had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Because the Swiss said, "We have rules."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION: How did they de-louse you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER: They made us take <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> , and de-loused us with sprays. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But we were first... Before we entered into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know, we were not permitted to kind of mingle with the world until we were properly handled. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">You know, we had to be decontaminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">You know, the Swiss are even perhaps more meticulous in their own ways than Germans are. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Uh, from that point, uh we were then...then the story continues in terms of what we did, about...about uh what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But at least we were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And this was in 194-...I say, January of '45, maybe * Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sankt Gallen</span> , or Fr: Saint Gall. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">February. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But it may have been late December [1944]. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I don't know exactly the date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION: This is a good point for us to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Just have a drink of water, and we'll go ahead and change the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER: Can I breathe now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION: You can breathe.... TAPE #2 .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Now one of the reasons she was able to survive and to be in fairly good health is she got up every morning and she, informationally it's interesting, so ask me some , I'll make a couple of additional comments about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION: Can we roll?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER: O.K., just give me a cue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION: I would like to begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Alright, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Now we are rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So let's go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> , and I'd like you to describe if there's any interaction, what were the officials like? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">How did they treat you? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">How did they seem to treat others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  Interaction with other inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I mean, in a sense--I don't know if I could ever prove this--but if you approached the <span class="DLF">fence</span> too close, I'm not certain that... I would expect the orders were to shoot, from the turrets that were guarding. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Nobody ever was shot, because people knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But there was no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">The other reason there was no contact is my recollection is that the group right next to us, with whom you could have shouted across the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , was a group from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ; and there was no common language of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Hungarians may have spoken French and German, but probably not Polish-- at least not most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I certainly didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So typically what kids would have done is talk to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">If there had been kids there, I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But I don't have any recollection of any kids around. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Our particular quadrant in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , our <span class="REGION">section</span> , in the back there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , if you faced the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">On the left were this Polish group. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">On the right, I think was vacant. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And the front was right off the main <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So really, we were not surrounded by people. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Our contact with the outside world--and I don't know what contact there may have been by adults, who had the communication ability by some communication with the German command. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Although I think it was quite limited; because nobody knew where, you know, what was going on, precisely where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Except, they had a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I mean, people had traveled around Europe knew that you go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in a certain direction for three and a half days, you're going to wind up in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> north of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I mean, that's easy enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Remember, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> did not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It's near a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arendenheim</span> (ph), or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I mean, there's no such <span class="NPIP">place</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="725"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> that nobody ever paid attention to, until it became <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Nobody would know where O wi cim--or something of that nature in Polish--where that community is. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The camp itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So contact with others in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was really nil. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">With the wardens, with the jailers, there was a different contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I remember leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> several times while we were there to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Now, we talk about showers; we have to remember what showers represented. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I certainly didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But I wonder how many adults knew that when you enter showers, one of two things can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Water or gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Because the major way of extermination was the Zyklon [B] gas that came out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower pods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Shower heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Again, in our case, that was not the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We were given certain sanitary privileges, because the only place you had hot water was in the showers. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I mean, not inside the compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">It's cold, and they didn't want to bury the pipes deep enough so they wouldn't freeze. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Cold water we had, I think, with some arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">No hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So uh we went to the showers at various intervals. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I don't recall exactly when, but any number of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">That's the only time that we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">The only time others left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I'm sure some people did who were taken into the <span class="BUILDING">base hospital</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">camp hospital</span> , and they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And the other contact was when people went out to bring in the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Our people, as it happens, were kind of katty-corner, maybe a hundred yards from one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">camp kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And the food was brought in in these large like 50-gallon vats. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Because everything that we got was some kind of liquid. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Some bread and some kind of soup- like thing and some kind of coffee-like thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">My only recollections of food that were brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were a type of soup, with whatever floated in it, a type of coffee, a type of, and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Water was, you know, water was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And people were let out under guard to go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , uh, people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and to...I don't know, a dozen people, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Whatever it took to carry these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vats</span> , and to bring to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and put in certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; and people would line up, and this would be served by our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Under the supervision of the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Beyond that, the only contact was with the German troopers who would come to inspect, as I said, every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Initially, we were told to line up at four o'clock in the morning, regardless of weather and regardless of what time they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I remember there were, I remember, two...whatever their rank was, I don't what. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Two folks who were in charge of the detail that would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And I remember both of these in the winter; because I guess earlier I just, it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We would be out there, and by this time the shoes that I described before that had been repaired, had not yet been repaired, maybe hadn't fallen apart yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And here comes, through the <span class="DLF">camp gate</span> , this small <span class="DLF">line</span> of several soldiers and several officer types with their black shiny boots up to their knees without a fleck on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I think somebody was running behind them and cleaning the boots as they walked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And one was a great big, tall, unpleasant-looking fellow, and he was the one who said four o'clock every morning, and when they asked him, well, couldn't you give us an idea as when you might be by, based on your sequence, we would be out a half-hour before. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He says, four o'clock every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I'm boss and you're nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He didn't realize he was boss over nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">He was then replaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Not because of our concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He was rotated on a different job. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And next comes a short guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I yust remember he was a short guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Also shiny boots, and he met with whatever the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> our group leadership was, and they made an agreement that said, look, I will be out every morning, let's say at eight o'clock, or whatever the time was. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I don't care when you gather, but when I come to that <span class="DLF">gate</span> , you folks be out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You can be there a minute before, two days before, but when I get there, you be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We thought that was a major human, or humane kind of an act. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He did say that if every he comes and we're not ready - four o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I don't know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I mean those kinds of, the sense of what a week was or a month was 1s difficult for me to reflect on. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And one day as he was walking by, he saw a young woman standing and her feet were literally out of her shoes because they'd disintegrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I mean the kind of decent city shoes were not made for the mud of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And after several weeks, they just wouldn't last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And he took a notice of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Uh, the next day or the day after or whatever, as he came by, his assistant had a pair of shoes for the woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Unfortunately, they were about eight sizes too small. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I mean, I don't know eight sizes, but you know feet tend to swell when they're in, or maybe they had a little frostbite or whatnot, and they were too small. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I think they made some arrangement and the shoes were enlarged, because we had a cobbler, but there's a certain sense of humanity even under those circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And a sense of comedy as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But order. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">As he came by to check, as he came by to check the people, standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , those who were unable to come <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , that were sick and what not, were permitted to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And some other officer, sergeant-type, would walk down the <span class="DLF">barrack doors</span> and check those. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Well, some of these camp guards really didn't come from the elite of the German Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They were locals in sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">In uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And we dubbed one of them "Popeye," because he smoked a pipe and he had kind of a jut jaw, and was Popeye. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Popeye sometimes would skip walking through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">When he discovered there was somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> who spoke German, all he would do is shout <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , "Alles in ordnung?" </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And if the response was, "Alles in ordnung," he'd go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">As long as order was maintained, he was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And, they, a piece of comic relief if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I know this on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because when I had pneumonia, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and I heard this. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And one of the people whose name I don't remember, she was a grandmother- type but of course to an eight-year old, anybody over 20 is a grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">She was the one who was in charge of the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Uh, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were elongated, long things sectioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So our <span class="REGION">section</span> may have had, I don't know - 40, 50, 60 people, a hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And she was in charge of getting the census for the inside people in that particular <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Uh, I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with my mother and other mothers and their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">There were no men in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but we were, we had free access to the men in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">My recollection, interestingly, is that the group was overwhelmingly female and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Out of 1600, but I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I know there were husbands and wives and other kinds of things there, but they were separate latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">men's latrine</span> - I was a big boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So some recollections about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and life and some elements of very peculiar humor and some elements of humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But this was all within the confines of lights, barbed wire, <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , food that is uh indescribable, and live machine guns and turrets that surrounded your <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I didn't know at what point they would have started shooting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION: When you say the food was indescribable, uh I'm sure you mean it was delicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER: I was, I would respond if I could in some humorous way of saying delicious for I mean somebody would like it, but I can't think of anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">The food was, talk about the ability of the human to invent and to in some way overcome certain adversity. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">My recollection was as I said we had a certain kind of bread, which was alright, and some kind of a coffee and some kind of a soup, stew, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It was always in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vats</span> , it was always some kind of liquid that could be doled out with a ladle, and it was also always something swimming in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Uh, how thin or how thick it was we never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We didn't know if horse meat or not, but it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">The invention of the Hungarian cook, Hungarians are known as good cooks I'm told, I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And the invention of people's need to, that is generally that people need to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Tremendous will. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I guess the soup would be, people would drink the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">It was warmer than the cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And that was OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Now I don't know what everybody did, everybody had their own inventions. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Mother would fish the potatoes, if there were any in the soup, out of the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And maybe some of the carrots, and make a kind of potato salad kind of thing which she would combine with a little bit of the chicken fat in the bottles that were packed months before. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">There may have been some salt and pepper that we may have brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">That's easy to carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And the bread, which was fine bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I mean, European peasants don't know how to make bad bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">The problem with the bread was not very much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So people became experts at slicing bread, so paper-thin that you could probably read through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So you had bread which was this thin, packed with this much of this potato salad laced with a little bit of chicken fat which had some taste to it, and that was a much better piece of food than whatever was floating in the vat. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">But every morsel of it was used. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I personally have never had problems with being over-weight, but I have some pictures at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , directly after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and everyone one of my ribs are showing. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I mean, I must have been as close to being, and I was not emaciated, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">We ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We were healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">But I am certain that if we had had the kind of nourishment that we had and had been made to go to work everyday, people would have begun to drop like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So this was the food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Now, we also had some care packages through the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I don't know whether once or twice while we were there, I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And some people brought certain things with them, and I'm sure people bartered back and forth with tins and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And I don't recall that bacon or salt pork or whatever it was that was taken was ever used. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I just don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But I knew, I do know that the bottle of honey and the bottle of fat lasted the length of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And I'm willing to bet if we had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> five years, it would have lasted the length of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Don't ask me how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION: You had a smart mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">A strong lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">A strong lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION: Were you aware of feeling that 1t was a bad time, a difficult time, a challenging time, or how did you think about that period of time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  It was a restricting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">To the eight-year old, it mostly, the thing that bothered me is the fact that first of all I knew there was danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I mean, I was told in so many ways that the march to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> had some potential problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I was not either so naive nor so young that I didn't realize that uniforms and helmets and machine guns and search lights did not represent, you know, kindergarten attendance. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">It represented some sense of danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I mean, I mean, eight-year olds know what guns are to the point that they realize that guns are made to shoot people, and when you get shot, you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So the danger was there, and clearly, I don't want to make any mistake about it, the turrets were there, the lights were there, the guns were there, and the barbed wire was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">What I don't know, I don't remember, I don't think so, I don't think the wires were electrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And if they were, they may have been at a very low voltage , maybe give you a bit of shock to let you know, hey, you don't touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But maybe that wasn't even the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So nobody would have gotten electrocuted necessarily from touching the wires, but you don't have to be electrocuted when there are machine guns and turrets at every corner of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So a sense of danger was there, clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And a sense of restriction. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">An eight-year old is told, don't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Well, what else can you do when you have nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">You don't really go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you really don't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , you really can't go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">That what you do is you kind of play tag, and if you can't do that, you're restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And those restrictions are difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">QUESTION: Is there anything else about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that you think you should say before we go on to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">ANSWER: I would suspect that there might be many other things which I might recall tomorrow, but for the moment I don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION: Were you aware that other people had a very hard time there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER: In our group, or in other groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION: No, in the other groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER: Well, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Uh, every day we would see people marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We were out there standing at four o'clock in the morning waiting for the uh, roll to be called. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">We saw people marching past our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then in the evening, while we were not out being counted, we saw people marching back. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And they didn't look too happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Although they were marching with, very easily with, in that particular community in that particular <span class="REGION">area</span> , with what looked like farming implements. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">They may have been working in <span class="DLF">fields</span> , or digging ditches or <span class="DLF">storm drains</span> or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">But they did not seem very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">They did not seem very pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And nobody was, you know, marching to the band, singing a song, going out, you know, to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION: Did they look healthy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They looked... It's important, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">To me, it's important; and my recollection is that these people did not look like the Allies saw the Auschwitz inmates and Bergen-Belsen inmates six months later--by which [time] they had not been fed for months, literally, and they were working every day and they were, you know, the...the skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">They did not look like skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But when people are malnourished to some degree--enough to stay alive, but not to be well--they look sallow, they looked deep-set eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I also have [the] recollection that an awful lot of people had their heads shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Now, maybe they did that for cleanliness purposes, for de-lousing purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">It's easier to keep yourself clean when you don't have a lot of hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Uh, and they were in uniforms of some sort, some kind of work uniform, like prison uniform kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Not stripes, necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And they did not look like happy campers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">QUESTION: Well, let's proceed to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Uh, where we left off, you had just been de-loused. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Did you have your head shaved ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER: No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Uh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , nor afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I mentioned before it's my impression, or maybe just my wishful thinking because being lousy in that sense is a very uncomfortable notion. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I'm not sure we had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I think we were very clean, because I recall people, clearly, washing themselves and cleaning themselves, and picking at themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And I saw the men in the men's latrines, picking hair out of the, examining the pubic areas and whatnot, or their other hairy areas to make sure that there's nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">People, since we didn't go to work, people had time to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And since we didn't go to work and had some food, we were probably in much better physical shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And if we had some sores from cuts whatever, they probably healed more so than if we had had no, nothing in our bodies with which to in some way attempt to heal those wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I am sure that my mother checked me five times a day, and the little boy who was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But no, my head was not shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Uh although it would not have been unusual; because every summer my head used to be shaved, by choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Sometimes my father and I both had our heads shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">We were kind of bald eagles for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Today I wouldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">It is no longer a sense of pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Gallen</span> ; and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Gallen</span> --which is in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> --we were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in the village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And it's [spelled] C-A-U-X. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caux</span> 1s a community directly above the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreux</span> , in the <span class="REGION">French part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> whose name escapes me, and I just can't remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I've not been back there, but my parents had. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">It was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that was taken over...over by the Red Cross, strictly as kind of a transition point for DP's; because DP's were coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> all the time, it being a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Uh, my recollection of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...well, several recollections. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">It's in a beautiful... It's in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , it's beautiful, it's gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I mean, it's wintertime and the snow; and the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> are heated and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> are clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And...and you can go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> whenever you wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And uh if you go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , you can even have a sense of privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">You know, they're not latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Lots of good things about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">But again, the Swiss are neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Everybody knows about them, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I think that we were fed for the two or three weeks a kind of stabilization, was potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">The point was to in some way nourish us a little bit, to fatten us up just a little bit, so we would be a little bit stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">By this time, my father knew where we were, 'cause he traced us both through the arrangement that were done through Customs of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And my mother and father were in correspondence by mail, which was a little difficult only because the war was still on when we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But through either direct or indirectly, I know that my mother made contact with an aunt of mine who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">That was a later part of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">That aunt is still alive--93 years old--my father's sister who sent us a care package. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Among them, a pair of shoes; because I told him my shoes had kind of seen their last. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I don't know whose shoes they were, but they were shoes that were large enough to put eight pairs of socks on, and really use them as skis. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Not quite, but they kind of slid down the side of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And it was delightful; because, you see, this is the first time that the restriction of <span class="REGION">territory</span> was no longer on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I mean, not that I could go climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , but if I wanted to be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">If I wanted to be <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , I could be <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I didn't have to worry about not walking beyond the fifty foot perimeter of the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So this was a...a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had a chance to kind of truly R&R, not as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And the idea was, at that point again, that the whatever--whether it was the World Zionist Congress, or arrangements with the Jewish Agency overseas, or elements of the underground, elements of political parties-- whoever was making the arrangements, they had to divide the people up to go to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Because people could not stay in this kind of <span class="BUILDING">transition hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Other people were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">My uncle, Uncle David, who was with me, went to be in some community in one part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with his agemates, as you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And they didn't know what to do with 20 Hungarian-speaking kids ages probably six to maybe fourteen who were in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And who either had single parents, or couldn't stay with their parents or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So someone came up with a brilliant idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Maybe what they should do is send this group of 20 kids to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heiden</span> , which 1s... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heiden</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Gallen</span> , or [Appenzell-Ausser Rhoden] province in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children's camp</span> for kind of displaced persons, displaced kids--Belgian, French. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I don't even know if they were all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">My mother had been a teacher.

except in certain sections of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">But my mother went with this group, these kids, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heiden</span> , and kind of ran a one-room <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> in Hungarian for ages six to fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">The director of this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of several hundred kids was a man by the name of Paul Miller. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Paul Miller later came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and directed a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> ;

<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">QUESTION: You say...you say you began to talk about, to find about the fates of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Did your mother talk to you about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Did you begin yourself to have a sense of what had really befallen others that you knew, that were related to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">The history...again, the information, as I am able to relate it to you, was something I could understand very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I've said several times in this discussion that the missing piece--not missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Uh, the piece that was not there was the emotional scarring that would have been there had I understood what this meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">But the information was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And, of course, I've learned other things since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">By the end of the war, the concept of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , as I say, was clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And we knew...I'm trying to think; I think all members of my family who died--and not all died, but most of them did--in fact, were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or on their way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And there was documentation as to when they got there, when they left, when the deportations took place, when they got to where they got, and the fact that they didn't make it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Example: My mother had two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">There were three girls in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">The two sisters and their parents, my grandparents, were deported together--towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> --with the daughter of one of those sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">At the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> as we know, they were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">The daughter went this way, never to be seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">The grandparents went that [way], never to be seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">The two sisters went a third direction, and they survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">The younger sister is alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">The other one, the middle sister--my mother was the oldest--died two years ago in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , after a very productive and happy life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I mean, she was _; yes, second husband, and second family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Because the husband didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">He died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">But we had, at that point, a very clear understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And uh my recollection of those is that this was an understanding of what happened, and an anger about what happened, and a concentration of energy towards what has to happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Not a preservation of what has just happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">We did not have the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And my mother didn't demonstrate to me the need to now sit and sulk about what was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">I mean, sadness and all, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">But we all set to go ahead, because you couldn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I mean, she was now in...in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And what do you do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">She's here, she couldn't be a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">She was 37 years old--which is certainly not old--and a very seasoned 37. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Typically, uh people in those days if they had uh... I mean, they had certain ideological kinds of commitments and connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">They went into the collective settlements called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">A 37 year-old in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> is a veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">A serious veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">'Cause the average age is 26. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And she never trained for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">She never had any skills in agricultural things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">What do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Arrangement was made that she would be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> not far from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">A very-well known <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> which was originally peopled by persons from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; so she could talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">She didn't know Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">She spoke Serb and Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">That was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And they said to her, very simply--I'm not sure that this happened in a confrontational manner--"Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">You have two children and yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">If you can in some way make yourself useful here and kind of earn your keep, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">But if you can't, we can't keep you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">We can't feed three people without in some way some quid pro quo." </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So she said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I mean, I am healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I'll do whatever you need to have to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">So they assigned her to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> she could do least damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">See if you pick fruit, you can damage fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But nobody can damage an onion when you pull it out of the ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So she... END OF TAPE ...she was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I mean, she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">The boy, the other boy and I-- Joash, or Ivan, and I--were in age by groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I was with the eight year-olds, and he was with the five year olds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Or eight...or four year- olds, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">No, nine and five by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Because kids lived by age groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Not with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And, you know, I did my daily whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and did my chores and played with the kids; and he did this with his. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And sometime we'd see each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I'd see my mother as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">But the interesting part of the kibbutz business was that at some point--fairly soon--for some reason I don't recall, there was a...somebody was sick or they needed somebody to take a shift in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And my mother was...uh I mean, she said she was really not indispensable in the onion-picking department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Anybody could do that, the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And they began to remark that the fact that the food improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Now, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">I mean, she was a very fine cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">She learned from her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">But the reason that her cooking made a difference was that uh she was perhaps the only woman, adult woman, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> who had ever kept <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">The others went to various training courses and <span class="BUILDING">agricultural schools</span> and what not--married or otherwise--and came as young people, maybe 18 or 19, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ...to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , settled in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and built the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And housekeeping skills were never imparted to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I mean, think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And material in those days did not come with instructions in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">microwave</span> , pre-seasoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">So my mother was able to steal a little bit of margarine, put a little bit of salt in it, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Two hundred people ate every day, and it made a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And they thought they made this marvelous discovery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">She became the chief cook of the day shift, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And they I think elected her to membership in the kibbutz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And they probably would have... would have probably paved her way with gold had she permitted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">She found a niche. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">She found a legitimate kind of a value, and became a valued member of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Now there was no problem about staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">They offered her... A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> elects its members, unless you come in from the very beginning; and they offered her election. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">That didn't happen, for other reasons which probably created the first clear recollection of trauma in my life that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">We were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> from '45 to '46; and in the fall of '46, my father finally gets to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">The whole story about what happens with him, that is much too detailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Let me simply say that he gets to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> by an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">illegal immigration ship</span> , and that story's known to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And his particular story is the story of the...of the uh two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that came out of [La] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spezia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And the only reason I mention that is that we know the kind of conglomerate and docu-history that the __ puts in the book Exodus; and in that, there is a chapter about a hunger strike taking place in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , which was not in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">That takes place in [La] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spezia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">That's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fishing village</span> in <span class="REGION">western Italy</span> ...north, <span class="REGION">northwestern Italy</span> , where two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> are chartered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">The people are on board, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British destroyer</span> blocked the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">The strike takes place; and these people, because of the particular position of the at that time Labor [Party] government in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they are...the human cry of [a] 96- hour hunger strike is so large in the world they are permitted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> under British escort, not under British guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So my father gets there without going through <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , and without landing on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> ; and kind of walks off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> kind of with [his] own two feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">It's a whole other story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">His story is fascinating; but again, it's not the particular one I want to dwell on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I told you before that my father is a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">He comes out of an orthodox background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">He is ordained as a rabbi from three <span class="BUILDING">seminaries</span> , or whatever; and certainly his life is a religious life, and his commitment 1s a traditional one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">The kibbutz > Novel by Leon Uris concerning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> of that name, which illegally delivered a group of Jewish Holocaust survivors to British-controlled <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">is ideologically left...left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , a left-wing kibbutz--HaShomer HaTzair--where God does not exist, and Judaism is a nation and it's a heritage, and it's a tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , when Passover comes and we have a Passover seder, the Passover seder is all translated or transmuted or transposed into issues of nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">The reason that plagues took place is because Moses was really a naturalist, and he could talk to animals and whatever else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And everything is explained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Now, I'm not going to debate the veracity of the explanations--both biblical, historical or left-wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">But God does not exist, religion does not exist and historical incidents are described by some kind of natural agricultural settings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">That's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Now, my father arrives at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> ; and it's very clear this is not...not something he is really willing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">They would like to have him as a traveling music teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">He is educated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in music, and he could... They would give him either a horse or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> --I don't know which--so he could travel to several of these group of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> and uh teach music, run choruses, lead an orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I mean, various kinds of musically-connected things, which under some circumstances would have been OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I mean, my mother had just become the chef. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">It was not what he wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">He wanted to stay in his <span class="DLF">field</span> ; but beside the fact that he wanted to stay in his <span class="DLF">field</span> , the living situation, the emotional conditions of a left-wing kibbutz, were adjustments my father was either unable but certainly unwilling to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">He takes a position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , as a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">But that means we have to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Well, that was terribly traumatic for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I did not want to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I did not want to...I mean, I finally found a niche of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I mean, finally...I'm only nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">But for the last three years... I mean, when you're four it doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">When you're six, it begins to matter; and at that point my group sense disappears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I finally was back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">My first grade was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Part of second grade was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Third grade was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , if you want to call it <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Fourth grade was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I was learning a new language, of course, my third language of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I thought the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">It was a life that I had not been familiar with, but became accustomed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Certain cultural things this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">A process so there's a certain macho, a legitimate macho, which made a lot of sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">It was <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I was no longer segregated in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I was shocked a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">First day I get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , I'm nine years old and I was assigned to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I think there were three or four kids in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> --four corners, four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and shelves and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And I think I wanted either to wash up or take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or something, and saw no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Now this is very nice indoor facilities; very nice, a <span class="BUILDING">stucco building</span> , heated, but not air-conditioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Maybe not even heated, there was not...no need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And I walk in, and there were girls there taking <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Now, I knew what I saw; a little bit about girls, probably more than other nine year olds do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I learned a lot in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> , when we were in a group of six and fourteen year-olds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And fourteen year-olds in their pubescent kind of interest are different than a six year-old; and I probably learned more than my age would permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">But I had never seen girls, and I certainly never showered with girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I mean, my notion was that boys showered and girls showered, and not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And this is not because of the free love and all that nonsense about kibbutz life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I mean, kibbutz life was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I just wasn't used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">They just came to the very pragmatic decision of who the hell needs separate <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">I mean, two sets of facilities for boys and girls age nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">If I remember, kind of making a <span class="DLF">bee-line</span> and running as fast as I knew how out of that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ; and I remember screaming, I left my towel somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I was going to get my towel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I was acting embarrassed out of...out of my skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I got used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">The second time 1t was OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">But it was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">I mean, this is not a major sexual traumatic experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">It was just a difference in style. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I had no sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Uh I just didn't shower with girls 'cause I'd never done that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Maybe since, but not before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And uh this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But we leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I adjusted to it in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Even my father didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">My father had a sister in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , who he had not seen in 35 years--the only remaining sibling except for his brother, David, who survived the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">He was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">His sister came out in 1914, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">As a youngster, as a young woman of 18 or so, to find her future in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which was the land of milk and honey, and the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were paved with gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">She did OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Came visit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">His pangs for family were strong enough, and we were able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I also think that he also came here to see what the world was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">The cantor business in--by this time, not still in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> --was not particularly booming, because every immigrant who had ever gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> or to a <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> or anyplace could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And there was no need for star-quality cantors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And my father was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And that's why he had various positions on his way to his Metropolitan Opera, namely the [Doromboh (ph)] <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , which was really a star-attraction place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">He came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philly</span> , was able to make some arrangements; and wrote to my mother and said, "What I want you to do is..." He always did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">He left, and then he told us to pack up and come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">But that's not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">We arrived...my mother and I arrived here in March of...March the 9th, 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for a year, and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and the rest is current history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">QUESTION: I'm curious what the reunion of your mother and father was in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Do you recall that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">ANSWER: Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I recall it particularly, because there was some... some concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">My mother come to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and uh I don't remember at this point anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Look, it's also forty some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Although I have a fairly good recollection, some details escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I have no recollection of whether or not she knew any of the members of the kibbutz from her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , or maybe from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days, or through family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Perhaps she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But she made friends with several of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I mean, you know, you have different levels of friendships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And I recall that my uncle-Uncle David again--came, who was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , uh came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> to one day and I, I'm sure I asked him why he came and I'm sure he gave me some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I asked my mother why he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I'm sure she gave me some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">But between the <span class="DLF">lines</span> there was some other expression, maybe from some other people, kids or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">That he came really to talk with my mother because there had been some rumors that maybe she and some of these other kibbutz people were in some way establishing a relationship that would compromise my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Now, I never asked my mother if she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I wouldn't dare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">But I knew my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">My mother was a uh very strong and very committed woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">So even though this stuff was going on, I'm sure this was hot air. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">My mother was a very attractive woman, 37 years old, and I'm sure there may have been some notion that said, look, if she were available, I'd be delighted to, and someone may have interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">But I don't think that she expressed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">So when my father came, their reunion, I have two recollections of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">One, and I don't mean the specific moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">When my father arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I had taken an excursion, maybe in an attempt to avoid, I didn't know who the hell I was going to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I hardly knew the man, in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">But their reunion was one very instantaneous and very warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And soon too raised a major issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">My mother also did not want to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">She found a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">But my mother understood that she had made a commitment and a lifestyle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">She also came from a traditional <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but she was not professionally traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I mean, my father was, that was his livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And she made an adjustment for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And she was willing to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , but the initial reaction was very instantaneous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">We want to remember that the kind of separations during the war in Europe did not permit you perhaps to separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Your mind was full, your emotions were full, your__——_—smay =zhave been full of, or maybe somebody just away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">There is no human being alive that overcame any separation pangs, so the reunion was not one of a reunion having come out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> without communication for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And secondly, there, well, they had been apart for two years, the better part of two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">But the reunion, my recollection was very smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">The readjustment was very smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">One hitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">How big a hitch it was I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I think it was a much more dramatic and traumatic for me than it was for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Cause she understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">My mother had a certain sense of duty, and she knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">She had been the cantor's wife before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">She would be that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But she did express it would be nice maybe to not, but I know I can't do that.</span></p>

ANSWER: I found age-mates, a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I was part of the, I think I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">The groups had names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">We were the Oak Group, the whatever eight, nine year, the fourth-graders or so were the Oak Group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I don't remember what the youngster who was with us was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">It was a different group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">But I thought that was terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Twenty kids, boys and girls, you know, a class-size, dorm-size, a cohesive group with some good kids, bad kids, smart kids, dumb kids, fat kids, skinny kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">It was a very nice group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">It was a perfect kind of a little tiny universe in which I could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And it's the first universe I had after some non-universes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">I remember the most previous experience was for eight months in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , being the representative eight year old in a group of six to fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">We had no age mates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And my mother was a teacher and that raised hackles with some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And you know, by others, uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">A tiny digression, I recall one of the kids, one of the ogler kids whose face I recall but not his name, for some reason, he, somebody came to visit me, and he accompanied me back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="BUILDING">off-campus</span> which was against the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">He was punished in some fashion, not corporal punishment, but punished for walking off <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> without letting someone know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">He probably could have gotten permission to walk back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I don't know, twenty minutes away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So he could take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">But he didn't tell anybody, so he was missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">When he came back, he was pulled on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">carpet</span> by Mr. Miller. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Guess who had lumps on his back the next morning for having ratted on him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">But after all, if everybody got ratted on, the teacher's kid must have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">It wasn't all bad, but I'm saying these are the negative elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">So that was not a very kind of a cohesive group for me to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Not only because I was the teacher's kid, but I was also the only eight year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I don't recall another eight year old in the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">QUESTION: I would think it would have been hard that you wouldn't be able to talk to kids of you own age, to figure out your experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">ANSWER: That's what I did in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> incidentally, or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days, most of the kids were not Holocaust kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">They're natives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Well, if you think about it, the people, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> had been established perhaps ten years before, maybe twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Eighteen, nineteen year olds got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">In their early twenties were child-bearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Their children would be anywhere from age zero to maybe twelve, fourteen, thirteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And in those days the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> did not keep the kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> I think past fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">If I recall, they would gather them in an intermediate or <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> setting where several kibbutzim would bring the kids together and really live away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">So 9 year-olds were perfectly appropriate in the age range on the kibbutz on a parental life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And I finally found a group, although it was a group that I had to adjust to and they had to adjust to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I didn't speak Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I wasn't really much of an outdoorsman or agriculturalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Interesting difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Most of the kids most of the summer ran around barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Now, they had shoes and sandals; but they ran around barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And when you do that, you can run on anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">Broken glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">You develop a callus on the bottom of your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">This one didn't, because he'd never done it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And he looked like a ninety year-old man walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , trying to make <span class="DLF">street</span> , on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , trying to make sure that he avoids anything that could possibly... And I really was the loner used to develop callused feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">I mean, I got better at it; but I wore sandals most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">But when people went into...into the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> --yes, we had a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> --I had to take my shoes off, and they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">I mean, there were a certain difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">But those were...those are reconcilable differences, not irreconcilable differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And I found a group, and I had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And that was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Now what it did to me, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION: In your group of friends, were there other children from the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">ANSWER: I said a minute ago that I think most of those kids were native born, or Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Truly, I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1328">QUESTION: Let's cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">ANSWER: Let me just think back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">I do recall some kids who were there, but they were European-born but not Holocaust kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">I mean, they had gotten there before the war, like in '39; or their parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So they may have...'39, yeah, they may have been two when they arrived, three or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And they were not Holo...they were European, not Israeli-born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">But not Holocaust victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And there's a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1336">QUESTION: But you were unique in your experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">ANSWER: I don't know if I was unique, maybe there was another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I certainly...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> there must have been somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">I mean, there was the kid that was with us; but I don't have any recollection of another kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">I may have in some way just decided to block that out, or I just plain don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">That's also possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">QUESTION: Because you're so old now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">ANSWER: Older than I was then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">QUESTION: Shall we cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , and remember how you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and what you went though? </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I'm curious if you had to go through any processing, papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Did you have to present documents? </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">What did you go through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">ANSWER: Well, I can dispose of that very quickly, because I came in as a non-quota immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">The laws of the <span class="REGION">land</span> , the immigration laws, none of that was, the or whatever the laws were at that time, is that certain clergy can come in without waiting for quotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">My father, being ordained and holding a position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> as the cantor of the congregation and as the associate rabbi as well, was permitted ...when he came here he was permitted to enter non-quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Which physically meant he had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niagara Falls</span> , which was the closest Canadian, non-American, point to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niagara Falls</span> , crossed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , walked back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">He entered the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> non-quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">As a consequence, his family didn't go through any processing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">We arrived by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Left <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> --at that time Israel-- left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> in, on March the 6th, 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Flew from a <span class="BUILDING">British military airport</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> by some two-engine <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to land in the <span class="REGION">Sahara</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I remember a man carrying out two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> , two buckets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">Those were the slop buckets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">This was a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">These were like DC-3 type <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">We spent a night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> , or several hours in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , we spent the night I know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">And transferred to a...to then ocean-going <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> - the Constellations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">They were very interesting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , these sway-back things that TWA used to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">But this was not TWA. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">This was the Sabena, the British [NB: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Belgian] airlines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">The first leg was the British, not British, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Belgian airlines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">The first leg was run by [Kobata (ph)], which at that time was their inland short route; puddle-jumping from, you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> to <span class="REGION">Sahara</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Uh, spent the day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I have not been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Will one of these days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">My mother bought a piece of lace, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I mean, after all, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> you have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And uh neither of us had ever flown before, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Neither my mother or I. I mean, in 1949, the air travel was not as prevalent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And I am always amazed to find that today, a very small percentage, proportion of the population, has never flown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">There are lots of people who haven't today, in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Well, brave people that we were, it was the fastest way to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">We got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Constellation</span> , went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span> , one of the radios went kaflooey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And we sat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span> for several hours; because the captain--and I remember him, he was a short gentlemen, a Belgian I guess--who came and announced to the passengers that he will not take off without that particular piece of equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">We said we agreed, although we didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">But we agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">Landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="1390">° I mean, typical trans-Atlantic crossings; and those were from someplace--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , something--often to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1391"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon-Gander</span> was the trans-Atlantic piece to <span class="REGION">Newfoundland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">And then, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Idlewild</span> --not John F.

QUESTION: That's wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">We have about three minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">You can, if there's anything you can think that you want to say in that remaining time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1407">ANSWER: Well, perhaps it's an interest of mine which is not just personal, but I think that part of the reason for doing this tape is to enrich history in tiny ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Because it's important for people to look at this tape and to look at other tapes and make sure that all the history that's possible, that possibly can be captured is captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">Because although I am one of the youngest people that I know that went though this particular experience, the people who were there at this point are getting to be fewer and fewer in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And each story is unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Not all of the stories are valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Not all of them are interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">Not all of them are noteworthy, but all should be recaptured in some way because you never know what kind of mosaic you want to put together and what piece of total information you get from this particular tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">Let the scholars determine what is important and what is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">But let's take whatever care we can to at least capture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">The technology is there to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">Wouldn't it be nice to have a videotape of the Civil War? </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">We can stop.</span></p>
