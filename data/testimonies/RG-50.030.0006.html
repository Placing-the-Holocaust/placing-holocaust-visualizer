<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  Would you tell me your name please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  My name is Francis Akos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Where and when were your born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , 1922 — March 30th, 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents and your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Will you, as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My father was a salesman, sometimes a traveling salesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother used to play the violin and that's how, how it started that they discovered maybe that I had some musical talent, but by the time I was three and a half years old I had a little violin and I had teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And my mother practiced with me until I passed her level. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And that was my <span class="DLF">line</span> of work from there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I became a violinist and a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I also went to the <span class="BUILDING">Music Academy</span> and I was sort of “non-child” prodigy, because everybody was afraid of that word, so I didn't have that kind of a push from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But I grew up as a Student of the Academy and music was my <span class="DLF">line</span> all of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Tell us what it was like for a young Jewish child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> going to the <span class="BUILDING">Music Academy</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, it was not as frightful as some of the young Jewish people who had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> because the Numerus Clausus, that was called the 10 percent, was very strictly observed in the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">In the <span class="BUILDING">Academy</span> that was kind of equivalent to the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , we did not have regular 10 percent Numerus Clausus there. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But we had problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And when the Nazis — the Hungarian Nazis, the Pfeil Kreuzler' — Nyilasok — I don't know how to, how to say this in, in English — When they started, there were bashing. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Head bashing and violin breaking on, on some of the Jewish kids’ heads and so we felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But we could still get to the point that — I was one of the prize winners at age. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I think I was, I was maybe 17, and I won the Reményi* Prize. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That was the violin that was offered to the so-called best student of the fourth grade of the <span class="BUILDING">Academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And they let me win it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In other words, it wasn't like many <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you, you couldn't even participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But + Arrow crosser (German) “ Ede Reményi then later, of course, when they started the so-called Jewish laws, according to the Nuremberg Laws, the Hungarian laws were much worse than the, than the Nuremberg Laws and that's well, that's a well known fact, I think, at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Everybody knows about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They were creating more Jews than, than there ever were because second, third, fourth generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They were starting to go back and if they found one Jew, Jewish great-great-great-grandparent, you suddenly became a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So some of the aristocrats were really surprised when they suddenly became Jewish — they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But in the <span class="BUILDING">Academy</span> this also started to bad, to be bad, but by then I was gone because I finished in ‘41, and by the time ‘43 came around I don't think there were in Jews at the <span class="BUILDING">Academy</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So when, when I finished, I got teachers diploma and artist diploma and I was Concert Master of the Jewish Community Orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We couldn't play anywhere else, but in the <span class="BUILDING">community cultural center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And there was some very high class concerts there, and opera and we kept up with, with ourselves and with the music. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I do remember there was a concert that I played when Kodaly’ came. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And Kodaly was a very outspoken anti-Nazi and he waited until everybody was seated and then he came through the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and sat down in the first row. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And we played Janos Starker and myself played the Kodaly Duo. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That's why he came because he knew we were going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So those, those things happened, but basically the trouble was — the handwriting was on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And when we got drafted like anybody else at age 21, the Jewish kids got the shovels and the arm band, the yellow arm band but we had to go through the drilling and we just didn't have any guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And that's how it, it happened that after having been on the front and pushing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian Mountains</span> , the — some of us were sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to get some clothes, because we were wearing our own clothes and they were in rags by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> October ‘44 when the big change-over happened, they deported me with many others, November four, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">November four they started us out in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Dohany Synagogue</span> , the biggest in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That's where I was Bar Mitzvah by the way when I was 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Now I was 21 and I — they collected us there overnight, and then they marched us across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and we saw the six <span class="DLF">bridges</span> all in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Can you, can you go back a little? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Can you tell us — I'd like to get a sense of what it was like in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as you were being rounded up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Well, it was just a, a melee because some people were trying to leave — I mean to, to escape through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and outside were the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis, with the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And not just Nazis but military people. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And they there — I think they killed a few, and they were just pushing them back until — we had no idea what they're trying to, you know, do with us because we were just several thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I couldn't tell you how many, ° Zoltan Kodaly but we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And, and nobody knew what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And when they started us marching across the, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , we still didn't know that before and after they were shooting people into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> from, from the other side of, of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But the lucky ones arrived in this big — what, what, what would you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Like, like a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , but it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It was some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> outdoors. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And that's where they collected us first and then they started marching us along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Tell us about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Tell us what the March was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  And some of those people — there were always some who tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Some got lucky and they did escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I know one of my friends who — at that time friend, I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and was in hiding, so when I came back I met him and we were rounded up at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So that forced march I think lost a lot of lives, but those who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I don't know how we survived because they certainly didn’t give us anything to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But everybody had something because you always carried a rucksack with whatever we had because that's all, that's all we had, what was on our back. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And it was a well known fact that the Jews arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> with all the values they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And that was their — the Germans great achievement that they could collect all the, all the gold and everything else what this so-called Jews had, whether it was German or Hungarian or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Anyway, we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I didn't know it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> until I saw some German writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And then they put us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> Neuengamme on the Ilth. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So the march was, was, I think, four days and then another week before we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Will you tell me about that ride in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  That ride in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> 1s exactly what you...what you heard from everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The dead! </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The dying! </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The excrement! </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The no water! </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The no <span class="DLF">air</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That's all true. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I mean that's all true until, you know, some of the survivors can — could tell about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But there were plenty who didn't survive that trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was together with, with two people who I knew that one of them was a father of a friend of mine who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And another friend who I got lost — I mean I got — when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which we didn't know what it was, you know, they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They herded us into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we had to undress and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">That's where I lost him. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But with the father — it happened that the father of the other friend — as it happened, I was, I was together with him in this — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> block, block. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">What, what you call this — the Khazen* and he died right in my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And when I, when I went back I had, I “ cantor (Hebrew) had to tell, tell him that his father died while I was holding him. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">That was — the first three weeks were, were pretty gruesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And then I got lucky and one of these Kapos” who, who were the commanders of these <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , got hold of a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">For whatever reason, I don't know how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That he knew that I am playing the violin and they were sitting at night when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> went by to, to go to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">While it was blackout, they were singing, singing songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">There were Polish people, Russian people, Germans, Hungarians; so there was a lot of folks, folks’ tune singing because they were not only Jews who were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So I led a lot of those folk tunes because I was playing the violin when — while they were singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">That was my, my rescue, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  The Kapo had given you....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  The Kapo organized the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That's the — organisieren® that's the word in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That he happened to find somewhere or, or paid with cigarettes or whatever for a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I had a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I didn't have a— my own violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So I had a violin and a bow, and, and I learned these songs and, and I was playing these songs with, with this — with these people who were, you know, just my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> comrades basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Only, you know, there was no — not real camaraderie because there were Ukrainians who hated the Jews, and Polish people who hated the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We were just in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but not for the same reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Anyway, this guy who, who, who helped, who actually saved my life, he was no, no criminal and he was no, no anti-Nazi as far as I can tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He was a barber who, who was doing abortions in the back of his <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they found him and he became a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and being a German, he rose on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> of, of becoming a Kapo, which means — what, what does it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">What did it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Kapo? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Constant — he was he leader of this block of the — what would I say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  That's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Most people know what a Kapo 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  What a Kapo is, is the commander of — command, commandant of this <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So I was helped by, by the violin, but when they evacuated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> no, no violin helped anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I mean I, I, I was one, one of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">One of all those people who, who got into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and, and was transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We didn't know where to, but then, then they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They put us on the — in the hull of some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That 1s very well described in that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">° Forman (colloguial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">° Organize (German); term used in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for the process of acquisition through bartering.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  I'd like — would you just never mind the book right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">What I'd like you to do is describe the book — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  The description of that, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is — was just a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> that had a hull, and we climbed down and it was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And nobody knew what's going to happen, but once in a while they opened up the light and they threw down a little bread and some, some people had to climb up to, to get a kettle down. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And there was some hot water that they called soup and there was no facilities for, for sanitary reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Absolutely nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And we were in there, I think, for two or three days and, of course, nobody knew how many days. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that was the time when the Swedish Banadot — Bernadotte’, Prince Bernadotte tried to, to get some, some special treatment for the, for the Swedish — for the Danish police and the Norwegian students who were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he did get some agreement I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Anyway, they were not on this evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They, they were sent somewhere else and then these, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> — there were two or three of these — were sent out to the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lueck</span> , Liibeck Bay and there was this gigantic <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> which turned out to be the Cap Arcona. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was the Hamburg South American liner, 37,000 tons <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury ship</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And they put us up in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140"><span class="INT_SPACE">Cabins</span> — I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> that had three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and I think we had 12 or 14 people in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And, of course, again very little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And again we didn't know what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The rumors — you know, by then most of the guards were old German soldiers who, who got drafted at the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They ran out of younger people so they got all these old, older people to be guards that they were not SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The, the commander and the higher officers, they were all SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And the rumors through these older German guards was that there is no gold on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So if there is no coal on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , why did they put us on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So all kinds of rumors right and left until May third came around and at two o'clock — a little after two — we heard bombs falling on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> started to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And panic and — you know, on, on a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> like this, there are steps going up from the “B” deck to this “A” deck and from the “C” deck to the “—D” deck and — I can't describe it because first of all, the guards were, were not no where. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And there was a open <span class="DLF">door</span> that you could see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I was on that, I think “C”’ Deck must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So I jumped just like most, most of the others who, who happened to be able to get to that <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was burning, and we were trying to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Was swimming a little bit, and there was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that must have been tied up to the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> — the morning they brought some bread and other food stuff for, for the, the guards I suppose because we never saw that kind of food — anyway, somebody got this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and started to get it away from the, from the burning Cap Arcona. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I was one of the lucky ones who got on this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And there were hundreds of people in that — in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And what happened some people couldn't make it because there was no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , on this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Count Folke Bernadotte And so they were pushed back in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then they said on the right side of the <span class="DLF">bay</span> , there was some Hitlerjugend® and supposedly there was some sign, sign from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> going — saying, "Don't pick up anybody," and they started machine gunning the people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I was lucky, on this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> we went to the left side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bay</span> and there was a U-Boat Schule’ — now, what is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="162"><span class="BUILDING">Submarine school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">submarine school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And we tied up this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we were naked and drowning and no shoes and no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Hardly any, any — you know, maybe some kind of a shirt but — not even shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We didn't have shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We had a — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> garb which was the blue and white marking and the numbers and so, who ever had that on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So we got on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , firm ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We —I don't know who. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I don't know who, who the others were. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Old, old prisoners from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tanks</span> were coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And one of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> stopped and pulled down the flag, the German Hakenkreuz'’. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They pulled down the flag and here were this, this people coming out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and of course, this was the first troops of the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They had no idea what's, what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">What-— who were these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I spoke a little English and there were other people, so we, we made it clear to them what, what happened, but we didn't know what happened — what bombed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So until much later until we found out that it was the British who bombed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and that was not just our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">There was three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> in the Libeck Bay. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And they were all bombed, and there were about 8,000 people who were killed in — during those last few, few hours of, of the war, because that was May three. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">At that part of, of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the war ended on May 3rd. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The whole war ended on May eighth, so five days later, everything was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But over here on this you know, the <span class="REGION">northern part</span> , the idea was that the British didn't know that they there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and since <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was always going to try to, to win the war, they were still trying to, to push, push troops up north through <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , etceteras, so they figured there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> going — this troops whatever, so they just bombed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">In spite of supposedly, because of the Bernadotte mission, they were supposedly informed that there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> with prisoners, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bay of Lubeck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Now, whether this got screwed up somewhere and, and the right people didn't get the, the message, you can't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But 40 years later, 1n 1985, a serialized book appeared in Stern magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And that was a very researched long article and at that time a friend of mine sent me a clipping from The London Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The pilots of this bombing raid 40 years earlier now they found out from this Stern magazine article that they bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners and they caused 8,000 of them to be killed at the last ®° Hitler Youth (German) ” <span class="BUILDING">school</span> (German) ‘© Swastika (German) minute of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They did not know it for 40 years who they were bombing on May third, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And since then, of course, there are books written about, about — No. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">German — a German book that 1s written, a well documented, with all kinds of documents in the book, that describes everything what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And I don't think that too many people know — English speaking people, know about what happened to the prisoners of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> , because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Neuengamme</span> was outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And the lives of, of people who survived in that camp until April 20, most of them were extinguished on May third by the British by mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So that's, that's the story of — that's the short story of the Cap Arcona. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">That was a, a fantastic <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury ship</span> as, as we found out afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Now the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> got burned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">In the hull, of course, there were thousands of dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was half as wide as the depths of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , so the hull — half of the hull was sticking out there until, I think, eight or 10 years later that they — I don't know on what basis and who — the Germans, of course, took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But all those who died in there stayed in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There was no way of, of getting the dead out. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But there were some washed ashore while I was still in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> two days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">The British gave us clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The British came with, with us and made, made the Germans open their, their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to, to give us food, give us clothes and I remember I, I went into a, a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of, of — I think he was either a butcher, butcher shop or some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">food shop</span> — and the Tommy not the “Tommy,” but — 1s that what they call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The Tommy’? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Yeah — came with me and he said, "Clothes." </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He was holding the gun and this guy didn't know what was going on because it was the first time in his life that he saw a British soldier, and the British soldier came with, with a, a guy in wet rags who, who had nothing on. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So they gave us clothes and food and two days later the British had an honor, honor guard shooting in the <span class="DLF">air</span> because there was so many coming — I mean fished out of the water, all those, those poor dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">By then they, of course, knew that these, these were not, not German soldiers, that, that they bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So there was some pictures that were taken and I happened to have kept some and in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In this Cap Arcona book, they, they got reprinted and so that's how, how life went on, starting with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Starting with absolutely, not a document, not, not a identification, not a piece of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">That's, that's how we, we started life after, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">At least I did and, and the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And the British was — were very helpful and very trusting, trusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">If I would have said I'm “XYZ” from, from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I don't speak German, they would have had to believe me because I had — nobody had anything to prove. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I told them who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I told them where I came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I told them I want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and they, they believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And they, they wrote out documents to that effect because there was no other way to, to, to prove anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So we did not know much what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I was lucky because I spoke a little English so I got, I got a job in the British Officers’ Mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I played their tunes, now. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Now I started to learn English tunes, because they — you know, they — the war was getting to be over. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">For them, it was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And I remember we were sitting — not sitting, standing, because they were playing the, the "God Save the King," and the King was announcing that the war is over and on the radio in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libeck</span> , the Officers’ Mess, 1t was May eighth when the war was declared finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And they really got drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I think I got drunk too. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was very interesting because I had no idea what happened at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , what happened with my parents, and what happened with whoever was left at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I thought, you know, you can, you can just maybe get some connection, the British soldiers, British officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They couldn't, the UNRRA, U-N-R-R-A, was not in existence yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The Red Cross was, was doing as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But I had an uncle living in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> during the war, and I remembered his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I wrote this postcard and one of the British officers took it back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to mail it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And he did get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">After a long time I found out that he did get it, and then he tried to contact my parents to tell them that I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I don't remember exactly whether, whether he succeeded in contacting them or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But it took me till, till September to get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because the French sent their, their special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> for the French people, and the Dutch did. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And, and I happened to be lucky enough to, to get I had a few friends who — Czech friends, and I got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech transport</span> and got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> I went on some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> again, but on — that was my own will that I wanted to get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And there was, of course, no, no luxury transporting from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but I did get back in, in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was a long time after the so-called liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  What did you find when you got back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  I did find my, my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They were both there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And a pretty, pretty badly ruined <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> that I, that I didn't expect to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But I saw the, the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> that they, they — the Germans — what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They didn't bomb it. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They, they just blasted it — blasted them into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> so there shouldn't be any connection between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">That's the way they wanted to stop the Russians from coming — from occupying <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was, well, nightmarish — a little light weight word. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I didn't, didn't collect these thoughts for, for a long time you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I, I was one of those happy survivors who, who got over it, and I, I was lucky nothing to happened to me, to my hands and I could go back, start to play again. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I was happy that I survived and didn't give it too much tragic thoughts, but when you start talking about it, you remember all kinds of tragic circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  When and how did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Well, I, I was — after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guteborg(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I was Concertmaster there. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">That was my rehabilitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I considered it my rehabilitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I was Concertmaster of the Stadtische Opera’! — </span><span class="sentence" id="263">the municipal opera from ‘50 to ‘54. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And in the meantime I — my application to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was, was being processed very slowly because the quotas were filled and filled and filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And in ‘54, I got my, my permit — my quota and I had some very good friends in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> — an American radio and the American newspaper and so I had a friend who, who was vouching for me, but you know, you had to have a sponsor. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But basically I got my, my permit and I came in ‘54. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And that's how it all started in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">A new life! </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But from ‘45 to ‘54, there were, there were several new lives being started. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Can you go back a little bit? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I'd like to go back to the war and I'd like to go back to 1942, ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The war had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">In ‘42, you were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  And by ‘43, things had begun to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Were you still in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or had you come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> by that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I was, I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Forty-one, ‘42 I was playing in the, in the orchestra and solos and stuff like that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I got drafted in ‘43 and with between ‘43, fall of ‘43 and fall of ‘44 I was in this in the army — the Hungarian army with the, with the shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That was the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That was the, the forced labor, you would, you would call, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">That's, that's what it was because we had to work with a shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we got, we got plenty of not just bad language, but bad hits, too, on, on the neck and the back of the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That hurts. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You know, when that peasant boy from, from some <span class="DLF">farm</span> who has two stars means he's one further up than the one who has only one star. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We had no stars, and we were the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We were the “dirty communists,” “stinking Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So you can imagine how many hits you got on, on the head if, if you didn't look right or if you, you happened to, to start with the left foot in, instead of the right foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And if the whole — it looked to them that the whole world hangs on whether these Jews are going to make good soldiers or not, with the shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So it was all incongruous. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The whole, the whole idea of, of us being, being in the army was absolutely meaningless. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">It was just a torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And you know, the, the army discipline meted out with not just with swear words, but with hits and, and kicks and the worst kind of, of punishment for nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Because we were not soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We were supposed to be soldiers, but we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And, and they had to show — when we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , we were out side of the <span class="REGION">Hungarian territories</span> fighting the, the Hungarians and the Germans were the Axis. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They were fighting the Russians and we were supposed to be helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And we were helping tt municipal opera (German) because we had to, otherwise, you got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So for helping pushing those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> there were no — very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">These were horse-drawn big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> that were pulling the gun — the, the big guns on, on wheels and the, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> was steep. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And either the snow was too deep or the, the mud was too deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So we had to help push. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">That's, that's how we, we were supposed to be, be soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And we got nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I mean at that point, we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> when it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We ate what we found on the <span class="DLF">fields</span> that was not harvested. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Raw cabbage, and that was delicacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We found other stuff that wasn't so delicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Because all we got to eat was a little piece of, of komisz'~ bread that they called komisz bread that, that they called komisz bread which, you know in Hungarian means “very, very bad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That's komisz. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And soup that has had nothing, nothing in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And that was — those were the worst times during the, the retreat because now we had to push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> the other way because the Russians were pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And, and the Germans were coming with their Stuka'? </span><span class="sentence" id="317"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I didn't use that word for about 40, 50 years, so I suddenly remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And, and then the Russians were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we were in between because we were digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> so that the, the water could run down so that we don't have to — wouldn't have to go through the mud that badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Anyway, it was work for, for animals and we were treated like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And that passed too, but quite a few didn't survive it because from dysentery and, and from hunger, they were dying right and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And these were their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">These, these were the 21, 22 year old Jewish kids, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So that was — I was one of the lucky ones who got to be sent back to get some clothes because we had just rags by then and — to collect clothes from the Jewish organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> — and then we didn't get back to the, to the troops because we were deported by the, by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Not really Germans, it was Hungarians who deported us, but we ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> like at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was — well, it was not bombed, and it — there was no, no — there were no, no street fight yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So it was just like it was a year earlier when I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">You know, the, the blackouts in the, in the evening, not much food in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , but still life was going on fairly normal like under, under the same circumstances, same similar circumstances like a year earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">There were quite a few people who, who were benefiting by the war but most of the people were just struggling along and, of course they, they did not see too many Jews because the, the, the Jews were either in, in the Swedish — or no, the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Protectorate buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">You know, certain <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> — then Wallenberg'* comes in the picture, sooner or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Not at that time yet, but still the, the Swedish started to give out these protectorate papers and the Swiss and I don't know — Portuguese? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I think they had some too. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But in any case they were not concentrated in the, in the so-called “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That was, that was then designated later. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They were still in their <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> but people 2 vile (Hungarian) ‘3 dive bomber (German) ' Raoul Wallenberg were moving from one to the other in case they got this protectorate. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So, there was — I wasn't there, so I don't know exactly what it was — what, what life was like when I was back there, because I was just be happy to be sitting in, in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> instead of on the <span class="DLF">field</span> and to be able to, to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bath tub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But it didn't last long because two weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">You know, we tried to collect the clothes and we tried to get back, and in the meantime the big, big switchover happened and we thought maybe, maybe this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So the end came by being collected and, and deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And of course that had gone on much earlier and in a much larger — on a much larger scale in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when they, when they took all the Jews from, from <span class="REGION">northern Hungary</span> and from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and most of them ended up in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So, the story of the Cap Arcona, I think, is, is very important because it wasn't just a Jewish story. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And that's why I'm so surprised — I was always surprised that nothing was known about it in, in other than the close-by <span class="REGION">German area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I think this book — that Cap Arcona book was, was researched and printed in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> because all this Lubeck, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , this, this is the whole area that was connected with, with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> of that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So at least there is one supposedly I don't know if they built it already, but they were going to have some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> built in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neustadt</span> itself which was the place that was closest to the bombing of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bay of Lubeck</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  When they took you down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , can you tell us something about the people that were with you as you were being herded into the Cap Arcona. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  It's a very difficult thing to remember because you know when you are being herded you are in the middle of, of a group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was normal — the regular SS type of, of “Push, push, go, go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The, the words they, they used I, I can't even remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It wasn't anything special. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It was going from — on the plank from one little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> into this big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , one little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> really into the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I don't think there was any, any special significance. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I, I can't really remember how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I remember that we were, you know, distributed into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> that, that used to be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury cabins</span> with three, three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , but we had 14 people in there so it wasn't so pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Is there anything you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  Not at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I really have to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
