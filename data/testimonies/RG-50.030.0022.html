white glove and just pointing on which <span class="NPIP">side</span> they should go, you know, the left or the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Children, with babies and my sister had a little — she was a two year old little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">She was so cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">She right away to the left, they sent her mother and my father, my older brother — he was Sandor. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He was at that time 47, 48, and my sister Mag-Magda she was, the only one sent to the right, you know, to, to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And the rest of them, first they went, there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">preparation room</span> and, and they used to cut their hair and they thought they're going into the show — into take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then they realized that it was too late, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> closed and the rest 1s history. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But after that they shipped us out to further, further. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We — first we thought we going, send us also to the East. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">East was almost certain death. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And West was to give you a little time to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So we, so we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I was a furrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And they wanted us to work, you know, as a— working for the government you know, to manufacture linings for soldiers you know, from fur, you know, into coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And tailors, they were — their different job to make different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We were hundreds of them, thousands you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And different trades they have — did different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">First they shipped, we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we stayed there for a month, then we — they shipped us to, to catalogue the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gyongyéos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">urban town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gyongyos</span> , about 20, 25,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And our job was, as a furrier my job was to catalogue — we were about two, three furriers — to catalogue furs, you know, what they gathered from the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That was a sorry sight I'm telling you, these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The — to see this, the Torahs, you know, scattered around — baby clothes, everybody cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So some of them even — we were there for a couple of months but some of them guys even spirited out Torah scrolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They were wrapping around their bodies, you know, with the — and they spirited out the Torah scrolls to have a minyan. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They still believed in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They believe in God, so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Sometimes I wondered; we all wondered. ““</span><span class="sentence" id="213">We were the chosen, we were the chosen” — sometimes believe you, it, everything was a bullshit. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But nevertheless we always go back to God, you know, because we learned you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">That's the way we brought us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And questioning God present creator, the — real believer if he questions something you know, the existence of God — he shouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">> Get out (German) ° Damned Jews (German) I was, I remember when I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and one afternoon, the Kommandant came and said to us — we were about 20, 2,500 people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — he said to us, he said, “Any, any of you wants to turn into Christian faith you can do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">You have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and, and kneel down, and, and, and become Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Then you can save your save your life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So you know a drowning man can, he can try to lift with, try to lift up himself with a razor blade, you know, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> — you know, to save himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And 99 percent of the Jews in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I myself I've never been a religious man even though my grandfather was very religious, was a Talmud khakhem.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And my mother used to have a sheitl — and all her sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I've never been religious, but I just couldn't go to kneel down in, in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I just — I said I'd rather die, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I remember when these boys came back you, know, from <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , they felt Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And they were goose-stepping like Christian boys, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They had their, their, their face was shined, you know, up. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I — then I feeled — felt sorry for God. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I was sorry for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They thought they were delivered from the winds of war to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Didn't help them, but they thought that it will help them because they turned to the Christian faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Nothing could have helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Even they were their great grandfather was Jewish, they were, they were good as good as the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So and later on matter of fact, that was after — I was just going back to these episodes — that when I went to, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1976, and I went to the Yad Vashem and I passed a monument in the middle of the Yad Vashem and was written that anybody didn't left his faith under duress, you know, is holy something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So I said, “What is it talking about?” </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I read it again, you know, went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I, I read it so it was, then I felt good about myself you know that, not because what's a different Christian and the Jews, you know, how they come from the same, they're all Semites you know, the same thing as Jesus Christ was a rabbi himself and I'm sure he'd teach his followers to obeyed his teachings, and every time they didn't listen to him, so such a beautiful words — “Thy, our Father, which are in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom comes, thy will be done on earth as it is in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="242">These beautiful words, they should listen and they should teach their children to honor their savior, the Jesus Christ. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They should listen, they should listen and the Christian clergy, they were teaching hatred against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Many times we asking why they hate us so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And they — how many times we try to shake their hands, even in the darkest nights, to be our friends and neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They'd always, they'd always denied their friendship to us and as always blamed their Christian clergy because they are the ones, they are the one, they are, they teach their the, the children of the Christian faith to be antisemitic . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They always did, and it's — and evidently it's didn't stop yet. " </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Sage (Yiddish) So when I was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And we worked for the war effort, as a furrier and tailors worked for the different things for, for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And how many times we used to get the, the air raids and the, the bombs used to explode, you know, in height in heights and it was saturated bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">How many times 30, 40 feet from me bombs used to explode and here I am to tell you my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And then I without a scratch, didn't hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> one time, it was September 1944, when the underground organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> approached us, few of us, and asked us if we wanted to join the underground fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I said, “Yes, of course,” I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So they told us, “Look, you — sooner or later they're going to kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It's just a matter of time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They said, “Why don't you just die with your gun in your hand rather than wait for it, wait till they shoot you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So two, 300 of us joined the — said, “yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="260">At a certain time because it was always dark in the night, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It was no light was allowed during wartime. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Otherwise the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming for surveillance or bombing, they could pinpoint the <span class="REGION">area</span> easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So, it had to be always dark, darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So on a certain date we dug under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> and during the night we slipped out under the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and they were waiting for us with pistols. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And they used to — they gave us a pistol and a couple of rounds, couple of magazines of bullets, rounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And they told us that anybody wants to ask for identification, shoot them right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Had to shoot them, otherwise they'd shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Because as a Jew — they what they did is, when they asked for identification from you, and they wasn't satisfied with it, they used to take you under the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and you had to show your penis. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It was only Jews, they were they were circumcised in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So if they showed, they show you your penis they'll shoot you right on the spot, so we had to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That was an order, to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And again we got into the this safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , you know, when the this underground fighters they gave us directions you know which way to go and how to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were a little familiar with the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We got there so the our command-— the commandant, you know, the commandant, he was he was he was 22 years old you know, but he spoke fluent German so he was questioning us, you know, if he want to be sure you know, we're Jew, we're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And we had to show him our penis, you know, we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">In a couple of days he was crash training — how to use small arms, fire arms and machine guns and grenades, how to throw effectively and in after two days we went to our first job. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So there were about 15 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So I asked him, where we asked the lieutenant — we used to call him lieutenant, he was 22 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">His name was Laci, Leslie you know in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So he said, “You'll find out where we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So, first we had to steal a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="282">A couple of boys knew how to drive, so they saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we used to follow each other about 50 feet, you know, not to be suspicious you know during the — it was dark, very dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So they find the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They put the, cross the <span class="DLF">wires</span> , and off we went outskirts to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> 1s two — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Danube</span> divides it. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> is <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So, that's why they call it “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So, finally we had a discussion that says we're going into this <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> , but it was circled and was pro-protected with the Hungarian patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, he went there by himself alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He was dressed as a Hungarian officer uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He spoke fluent German and Hungarian, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He was asking for the — he was asking direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So, we park that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , you know, for a short distance from this <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Two guys, both <span class="NPIP">side</span> , two, always two of us one side and two on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Two patrols. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We grabbed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We was told what to do you know before. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Close his mouth with the bayonet, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We had to stab him that many times and this has to be repeated about two, three times before we got into the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , dump, <span class="DLF">dump site</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So there we gathered all we could — the most important thing was <span class="DLF">mine</span> — to get <span class="DLF">mines</span> to — because our purpose was to delay their supplies and sabotage their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , you know, the supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So we got as many, much heavy machine guns can and grenades and <span class="DLF">mines</span> , as much as we could carry, you know, 15 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And we loaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> — we loaded — got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> loaded and about two sappers stayed behind to, you know what a sapper is. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They put four, five different <span class="NPIP">places</span> but <span class="DLF">mines</span> in into the <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> in a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Didn't go more than 500 yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We saw the like a fires — what do you call it — blaze, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was like we destroyed the <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> you know, when it were up. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They were searching for us all over you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And they were going to spy, disperse the personnel, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">They had to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The <span class="DLF">mine</span> was the most important thing we have to go in during the evening at night to mine the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> and <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So, but they start to repairing it you know, the faster and faster, the because they had no more men than we were, you know, the army, you know, the Hungarian army and German collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So it was, it was — I remember the date — was it September, September 1944, and Horthy,” I told you that Horthy Miklos — he was chancellor already in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and this visit came out from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> on a false pretense and this Jew-hater Szalasi, he took over the reign, and he was a well-known Jew-hater. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He was worse than Horthy Miklos, but when he spirited Horthy Miklos out they called him he was he was a Jewish collaborator already, Horthy Miklos. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Besides they call him anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So in March, in September seven — 17, we heard on the radio that they going to make a big parade, when they took over the reign from Horthy, on <span class="DLF">Vilmos csaszar street</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So we had the order from the American and British intelligence, because we worked for them because that's the underground fighter — they told us that we actually worked for the British-American intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And we got our reward — they will reward us you know after the — after we do a good jo— good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Who cares what they going to reward us? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">What they going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But nevertheless, about 200 of us waited for the columns of the parade on Vilmos csaszar * Miklos Horthy ” <span class="DLF">Ferenc Szalasi street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We, the night before we placed heavy machine gun and all kind of fire equipment, you know, with submachine gun and grenades and you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Pistols, were 200 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Two hundred people, you know, could do a lot of lot of damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I remember the waiting in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , wherever we were stationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And we heard the column. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">The column was coming and saw the cheering of the Christians well wishers, you know, with the fascist flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They were waving fascist flags and, and sitting on — they have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and spick-and-span uniforms, you know, the people who go on the parade. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="330">Give them, give them three cheers,” you know. “</span><span class="sentence" id="331">Salute.” </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And then we gave them the three cheers from our guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And 300, 200 angry Jews, they can do a lot of <span class="DLF">dam</span> — do a lot of damage for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We figured that if we do lot of damage you know for the Szalasi regime, then some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> population might join us you know, to and fight for to end the war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But no. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It didn't happen didn't happen that way at all, and our and our job was to sabotage the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> again, again, again, but they were, like I said, they were fixing them up and faster and faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And we became the spies personnel you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They were looking for us all, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And — but luckily the <span class="REGION">areas</span> you know, during the day, everybody was running for <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They didn't have a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They didn't look for us so much, but nevertheless we — our unit as a underground fighter became obsolete in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We was, just couldn't do much. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We, I didn't say, I tell you about, we saw so many times that this Fascist used to come in, used to bring, gather the Jews, used to catch them on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Used to bring them, just hundreds of hundreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Used to line them up aside of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Used to just machine gun them down, with babies and children, and anybody didn't fall, they just used to kick them right into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And only a few Christian on-lookers, and helpers. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And it happened so many times, so many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And nobody helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">No thundering and no lightening from <span class="NPIP">above</span> .</span></p>

class="sentence" id="570">So that just before the Kommandant said to us, that he want to raise the bread and, and the tea — “We'll give you more if you work more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They couldn't get anymore men. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">We couldn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We were lethargic. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We didn't care about things then at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And then when I got sick, he told me to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , “Stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We'll take care of you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And that was the last thing I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I was on the — I couldn't get up from the, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And I remember that I felt it was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I felt so serene, relaxed. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I didn't care about a thing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Even, and I just figured that, “This is end of my journey.” </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And evidently I lost conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The only — when I woke up, I woke up from a smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I don't know how long I was unconscious, maybe a day or two, but if because if I would have been alive, they would have shot me, or stabbed me with the bayonets stabbed, would have killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But — the Russian forces that came so rapid-rapidly they advanced — they had to pull out fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And they didn't have much time to look around. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Maybe I was — I didn't have any motion. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Didn't show any motion in where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Probably, I was ina coma, in a temporary coma, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And they left me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">When I woke up, that I, from the smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">What happened is that I was, when I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> on the sleeping ,or sta— laying down, there was a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> for <span class="DLF">air</span> , you know, on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> — not a <span class="DLF">window</span> , just a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So through that <span class="DLF">hole</span> the bombs they exploded in the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> and sprayed the, the life-giving ammonia smell on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Was all covered with the feces, of human feces. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I woke up from the smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And I looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I saw hundreds of bodies of boys that di— they were dead, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Motionless in a form of different grotesque of motioning — you know, they was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I looked to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I saw a man in uniform at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">He didn't come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">He was afraid to come in, with a, with a sub-machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He was motioning at me to come <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Well, I was trying to get out, get down. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">You know, I was the third <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I was — I couldn't come down, was so weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But finally about a couple of hours later I finally came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I fainted I don't know how many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You know, I came down from the, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and I finally got to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He never touched me. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">This, a couple of soldiers came around, and they looked <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They saw all the dead bodies and they were afraid, you know, to come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So I said to — they asked me, you know, things but I didn't understand them. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I, first of all, I couldn't hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And I didn't have hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They lost that's a symptom of the fleck typhus — you loose your hearing and they're finding out later that and you loose your hearing and you loose your hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But I have, still have the yellow armband on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So a couple of — I couldn't hear them but I, the couple of words I know from a friend of mine — they were Slovak and they and I know “sid “Zid, Zid,” you know — I know what this means? </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Means “Jew, Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And they understood “71d,” because the, the Russians, they, they know what “zid” is. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">They used that many times themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So, so they talked to me but I didn't understand them. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So one of them *! </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Jew (Slovakian) gave me a piece of bread and a piece of bacon, you know, to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Luckily I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I was — that was my main luck, but it was good luck I couldn't eat because I would have, if I would have eat a piece of bacon and would have killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I found out that later, but I don't know why — I just couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So he was motioning to me to go back to the — there were <span class="DLF">front lines</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The <span class="DLF">Russian line</span> was in <span class="DLF">trenches</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the German other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They were cross firing at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I'm telling you I was walking right across between the crossfire without a scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And one time a Russian soldier motioning at me to come to him, and he want to tell me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But I couldn't hear him, hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">He wanted me to lay low. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I didn't know what he was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Like I said, I was going every 10, 15 feet I had to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I was very weak from the sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So I was — I remember I walked through the no-man's land. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And finally I walked all day I suppose, because I remember about one and half or two kilometers you know and came to this artillery position this Russian artillery position, and this guy, and this Russian saw me the yellow star, yellow armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He wants to give me a loaf, gave me a loaf of bread and a piece of bacon. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I remember holding that loaf of bread and piece of bacon. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I was squeezing to my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It was all mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">You know, it was something else, you know, that piece of bread you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So I was going back that — it was a <span class="DLF">front line</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We, I wanted to get away from as far as I can because any minute, you know, the, the counter-attack it could come from the German and it was bad to worse, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So, I went to went to — finally I went to few kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Constantly harassing, you know, the Russians — they were asking identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Many times just looked at, looked at me and they looked, search in my pocket — they find a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They just let me let me go further back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You know, it was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But one day I got into this <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Russian headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I didn't know I where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I was — I sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they wanted to, wanted to know what I was doing there, you know, the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So one officer came out and he said to me, "Du bist ein Jude?"”” </span><span class="sentence" id="663">in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I said to him, ‘“Jawohl, jawohl."”</span><span class="sentence" id="665">° I could have hear a little, little bit because it was a few days after, after the, I was liberated. “</span><span class="sentence" id="666">Ich bin ein Jude.” </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Then I said to him, “Shema Israel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So he said "Shema Israel," himself . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So he got me a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with a soldier, Russian soldiers, and without a stop that horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> took me about 20 kilometers to the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> , to Red Cross, to — you know, for <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for Russian soldiers or some civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Over there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they de-liced me, you know, and washed me and they told me that next day they're going to ship me over to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , you know, on that side. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So following day they took me over to the <span class="BUILDING">veteran's hospital</span> and they want to give us food you know but lucky I couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They were hundreds of hundreds of Jewish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They were somehow they escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They were eating and eating * Are you a Jew? (</span><span class="sentence" id="675">German) * Yes, sir (German) “Tama Jew (German) and eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They were dying and dying and dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They were died — hundreds of them, by the thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They would — ‘til they realized what's the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">You know — they were all over-eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I feel like a million dollar you know — they gave me a cup you know to — and there was no lice on me or torment — our tormented bodies, you know, was shrunken to like a just a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But I wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I didn't know if anybody's, anybody came back you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">First it was 200 kilometer to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , you know, because from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is 200 kilometers, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is another 200 kilometers, that's — and in wartime they couldn't get the transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It was — everything was for war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And but one day — I was there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> maybe 10 days, and my gain, my weight gained about — I was at least eighty pounds at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I didn't have clothes on me, because they destroyed all my clothes because all they infested, you know, with lice, so on the Schwester,” got me some old clothes from two, three sizes larger than — she felt sorry for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But nevertheless I had something on. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So I was walking there and a boy came with a horse, one horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and stopped and said to me, Hungarian said, “You want to get a ride? </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Where are you going?” </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I said, “I go, you know, toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="692">He said, “Come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So he pulled me up, said, “Well, where, where have you been?” </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He said, “I was nearby in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">He said he was hiding in the haystack and luckily the — didn't burn, you know, the haystack, and he, he escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Usually it was a large haystack, because they would they were going with the bayonet many times you know all around just to make sure you know nobody in <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , but he was evidently miss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And didn't burn, so he escaped by chance, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">But we went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the Russians patrol stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Says, says — starts talking to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Not, not four letter words, but 10 letter words, you know. "</span><span class="sentence" id="702">You so and so," you know. “</span><span class="sentence" id="703">Where you get the horse? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Where are you going?” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So the other boy, he spoke a little Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Slovak and Russian are similar, you know, Slovak language. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So, so the sol— the Russian soldier — before he finish his — all the sentence, we jumped off from the — from horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , said, “You can have the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They will shoot us, you know, the it was, the lawlessness was law, you know, those days and the strong was the — weak was the pawn you know and the strong was the rule — the ruler. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But nevertheless, I always — I'm grateful to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They were the ones they liberate-liberated me, you know, the even though — because the politic 1s — the politic is something else, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">This is something else, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Nevertheless, they saved, they saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">If they didn't come in days or hours sometimes you know made a big difference between life and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So we got some somehow we got on this <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , got into this <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian station</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> Nurse (<span class="BUILDING">German) station</span> and we find this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">You know, there are a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We asked the stationmaster we could hitch a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Said, “Go ahead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So we didn't we didn't know which way the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We want to go, get away from there the worst way. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We got into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there were thousands and thousands of people Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They were trying to get a ride you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">It was transportation was unheard, you know at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">But they were — everybody wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So finally, we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , was heading, heading someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Everybody jumped in, jumped on the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and the flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> you know, the flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">You saw them for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Many times they used to used them for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank carriers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I remember one — I was sitting at the edge of the one night we were going and there was sitting 100 people, 120 people — I don't know how many could have sit or, or hang on to this to this flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And I was sitting on the edge, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going slow but was shaking up and down, and I fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I remember, fell between that the — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I mean on the on the — so I somehow I threw myself out between the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , because it was go slow, but instinct, I throw myself out. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">They pulled me back, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They couldn't kill me you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So well finally we had so much tsuris, you know, we, we took days, but we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , before the war, and his wife and two, two of, of, of their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I figured maybe they're <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So I got it; I knew their address. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So to me, I was dressed, you know, I would look like I had a piece of rope tied around my — with waist with holding my, my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">It was large, and most, most of the Christians, they thought I'm coming from the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the prisoners of war camp or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So I, I got into there, there, to my uncle's place to walk, and, and my uncle was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my, my aunt was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They, they somehow survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">They went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and other — and they, they wait around. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They have some, they bought some papers from the, from — they got some papers from the Swedish government with something, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">They, they survived under the pho-— under the Christian name, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But they, they were just by luck, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">If the war would have lasted a little longer, they would have been dead also you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">It was just the timing, it was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And when they saw me, they first didn't recognize me right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And they saw, she starts screaming, Aunt Margit, "It's you Miklos!" </span><span class="sentence" id="751">We call — Hungarians used to call me "Miklos." </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Oh, how I looked ter- terrible, I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And she starts screaming about that, because their two, they have two daughters that didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the — from that time which was in April, and, and the war was still going on all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And they asked, and they are screaming that even I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already and their children, you know, their parents are you know, the, the — their children they didn't come and somebody else came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But nevertheless, she was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">She was — cooked some something, some, some, some food for me, and I ate some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And — but to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , from that was — that it was a terrible thing from, from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home-hometown</span> because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> was, 1t was bombed and it was it took a lot of time, you know, to repair and, and that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And so we slowly but, slowly but surely — many times, we — the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had to stop and, and, and the Russian soldiers came and identification and, and they used to select some young, young people for, for the war effort, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">They all shipped them to — the war prisoners — to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or they, they used them first for labor, for, for, for laborers, you know, for whatever reason it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Many times they start shooting, you know, indiscriminately, to scare the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">There was no-nobody could have say “no,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They, they couldn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They, they were the rulers that time in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And their atrocities was terrible, you know — the Russian atrocities, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But — and the, the wounded or whatever was laying around by 10s of 10s of wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">No one could have helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Was screaming, all over the, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But, I remember my, my uncle gave me 100 pengo. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">At that time that value was — maybe I could have buy three kilogram of bread, you know, for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And he told me that, “When you have enough money,” you know, to give it back to him, because they didn't have enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So, I said “sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so I used that 100 peng6o to buy a little bread, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">For, for money you can always get something, you know, for the, for the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So sometimes I even bought an onion, an onion to, to season up the, the my menu, you know, the pie— little bread and onion. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And finally I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and you'd be surprised that it was 400 kilometers from the, from the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It was, the life was going on just like, just like nor— 1t was normal, but very, very normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Like, you know, we go to buy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So first I, I went to — I went, I remember stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and all my memories came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">You know, I was — want go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because my uncle didn't know if anybody lived in my, my, my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they didn't have communication, didn't have telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Nobody had telephone those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So, I, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and it was in the evening, and I find — I met on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> — it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know, my — I find a friend of mine, was grown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">His name also was Laci. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So, we start crying each other, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Although at first didn't recognize, didn't recognize me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Asked him, anybody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know because we were 1,200 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So,
