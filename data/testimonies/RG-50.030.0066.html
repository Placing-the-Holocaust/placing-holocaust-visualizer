QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I born in January 1916 in -- I born in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> really, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brudzew</span> , B- R- U- D-Z-E- W, but when I was five years old my father moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I remember when he lived in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they had a <span class="BUILDING">textile store</span> -- they called him "the millionaire." </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He probably made a living, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But wasn't, not -- one of the not many Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , so automatically he called a "millionaire." </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And that's the reason my father left, was just afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It's the antisemitisms for Jews, so he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He left, he went, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was when I was around five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And he started different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father was really not a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He was really a scholar. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He studied for rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He never practiced it, but a very Talmudistic -- he was really a -- let me call a scholar. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">That's probably the right word. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But he had to make a living, so he had this textile and then he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> to live and he started different kind of business; and, we, we were not poor but we made it all the years, we made a living, nice living. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And my youth was, in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I went to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> which also had, from the government, you had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to make, regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">How do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The...
QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So while you -- there were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , what they had it connected together. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That covered that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So you had both things in the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And that's the kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I finished, the <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , called <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , maybe till around 14 years or 15 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And then I started to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My uncle had, a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , a textile — stockings, they made stockings there, also textile. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I worked with him there for a year and then I--
QUESTION:  What, what was life like for a teenager at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Well, well, we always felt that we are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We were sections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> I wouldn't go as a Jew, because you were a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I don't know -- discrimination of, 1t was so much against Jews I assume I didn't really felt it so much because I lived more in the area of Jews and I maybe didn't have so much contact with not-Jews, but the -- you always were aware that you are a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You didn't go in certain <span class="NPIP">sections</span> which was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">You felt that you are a Jew because the laws which were there or the surroundings what not-Jews, how they acted and reacted to your being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So that was really what was as far as I can remember as a as a as a teenager.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Did you join clubs? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Were you part of a group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Not really, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We were more -- Jews, my friends who are Jewish, mostly, and we not really lived in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where were just Jews living. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We were also in an <span class="REGION">area</span> what lived other people, but your contact mostly you had with the Jewish, because you were resented very much from the not-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Very seldom that you had a not-Jewish friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my time was that I worked, I worked till, when, we are 20, 20, you had to go to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">When you are 20 you went to army for one and a half year. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And that was in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And, but my mother died in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">She was sick, I don't know exactly what, I think bronchitis or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Anyway she died and I was about 20 and there come the time I had to go in the army and my father remarried after a short time, married, and I resented this. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So as it came I had to go to the army and I served in the Polish army, for almost one and a half year. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My time expired. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">You -- after one and a half year would have been on September the 15th, 1939, and the war broke out on Ist, September the Ist, so I ended up being a soldier while the war broke out, so I was in the war as a soldier, Polish army, against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Now talking about the reaction of non-Jews to the Jews, when I was in the army I went in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I was just as afraid from my comrades and from my sergeant as much as, as I was from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I didn't trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They mentioned, "You are a Jew," and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So I was really afraid in a time like that can happen anything with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So, we fought till the 25th, seventh, whatever the two weeks, three weeks; and I ended up, I became a prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And the first reaction I had on the front with that soldier, the German soldier what took me said, "Are you a Jew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I just said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But he didn't react. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He could shoot me or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He didn't -- said, "Go, go, go." </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And they didn't do anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So, but anyway they took us as prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They kept us for two days outside 1n the <span class="DLF">field</span> and it was cold already and they sent us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as, as prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And as prisoner of war we worked; it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I got sick and they did hardly fed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They didn't get hardly any food, and you know any -- may, maybe I need some medication or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I didn't get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And most of all was our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We went cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was -- must have been near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And there we cleaned the <span class="DLF">street</span> and, and -- till the one day came that all the Jewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Pole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That was in March of 1940, and they sent us back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to Pole, because they figured for the Jewish prisoners of war still has some more privileges than a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they wanted to get rid of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That's the reason they send us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I came and I thought I go back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my father lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">When I came there I found out that in '39 already, in December, they already took all the Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , so all the Jews took out and sent them away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So I followed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I didn't know exactly where, but somehow -- I don't remember how I found him. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I found him where he is, and I came there and he had a hard time because they took only with them whatever they had on their shoulder and they had on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They didn't, could take -- you couldn't take anything with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So that was a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So was very, a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So when I came back and I looked down what's going on, so I figured -- I went, I went to a farmer and asked if I can be a help there, as farmer's help. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he agreed to it, and he kept me there as a farm's worker, and I just did farm work. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Was a Ukraine family and, he paid me. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They gave me food and shelter and I think he paid me by the year with so much bags of corn or whatever, what I could sell and that I could help my family with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I was there for one and a half year, and then my brother what was nine years old, younger, was in the age that he could -- he was about 18 or something -- so he could -- 17, 18, that he -- I found for him a job too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  What was it like on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Now they were, they were nice people and they took me like a <span class="DLF">farm</span> 's help, and probably I was cheaper than anybody else, but they were nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were pretty good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They were not really to mistreat me or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And, I had to do all the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They were very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I cannot, say they mistreated me; but my father lived in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , not far from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , about five miles away, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So sometimes when I had a day off I could go back there and I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">A matter of fact back then there was not any transportation there, and there was very hard for the people, for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Very restricted, curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They couldn't do things much, but the mostly what they lived 1s they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , brought some merchandise and sold it and that's the way they could live, 'cause it was not that -- they probably they didn't much trade and there was not any industry whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So they had really a hard time and, and the Germans mistreated the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">If he saw one on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he didn't like him, he could shoot him like that and they buried him 1n a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he stood where he shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So we had <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you have to watch just not to go on these <span class="NPIP">places</span> because there's somebody buried there, so this really was a sad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was also very dangerous to go from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I, where my father lived because if a German saw you on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and he didn't like you for whatever reason, he shot you and no, was no recourse. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He couldn't tell anybody, nobody will listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He was king, as far as a Jew concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He didn't need any laws to ever, to adhere to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He just, just did whatever he liked, he felt like. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So that was really -- you got used to live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">You took it already for normal the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You just watched out that you are not around what get shot or whatever, so we worked there and the restrictions for the Jews became every time more restrictions and more restrictions till, one day the only things what Jews could do is working at a <span class="DLF">farm</span> as a farmer's help. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So we were still safe for a little ttme because in meantime they sent all these Jews, sent away to all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And in June of 1942 when they, they sent a transport of Jews away from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and my father was in this group with the second wife, with my step-mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They were in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Later when being tn, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> I found out that this transport went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> because I met people, younger ones, what went with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and they worked there, so they knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So, to come back to about my story, when I -- so I, as I say we still were able to work at the farmer, till one day all they came the restrictions Jews couldn't work at farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Everybody has to concentrate in the next <span class="NPIP">place</span> , nearest <span class="NPIP">place</span> , bigger <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- all the Jews around what work for the farmers, so in other words it was strict, no, no Jews anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So we know what's going on, so we didn't go, so my brother and my friend were -- all three we worked at the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So we decided not to go to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We thought, "Let's go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Maybe we'll find some, some partisans, or something like that." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So we went in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> instead to go to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we walked around in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We didn't have any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was cold and no shelter, nothing, so we had to come, find our way out of it because we didn't find any partisans and you couldn't live that and the people, the Polish people, wouldn't help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">First of all we were afraid to show our face and if we did even they were very reluctant have anything to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You were afraid they might go to tell the Germans that you are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So we heard somehow that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> --was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> about maybe 10, 15 miles away, 20 miles, whatever--that there are still some Jews in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so we walked till we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We came there in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And we came, there were still Jews there and we talked with the other Jews what lived still there and surely everybody was helpful to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We told them where we come from and what -- sure -- they took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Every stranger, they took us in, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there was full with Jews, you know, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and everybody just took care of a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> ; and the same night the Germans came at night and drove all the people out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to collect them in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and to go to send them away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Now we were still -- there was this old <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , you had this attics and things like that, so we tried to hide there in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> not to come out, but they didn't do any effort to get you out because they figured eventually you will have to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">No food, no shelter, no facilities, you have to come out, and that is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">After three nights hiding and not having food, whoever was hiding came out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the others went already what they collected, they went already sent them back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we were the ones what were hiding, so they later they took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> ; and, whatever people they collected, they pushed us in, in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> , as many people as they could squeeze in and we were standing, no moving, nothing and the whole night we traveled in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Now there was people fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">People had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and there was, there was a mess -- you cannot imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But you had no, any choice, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So that after the morning -- in the morning we ended up arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">That is the way we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So I was with my brother and myself and my friend; and we all meet the other rest of the people, about seven, 800 people and they took us out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they put us 1n two <span class="DLF">lines</span> and they start collecting -- picking out people. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I didn't know what the picking out means, so one German asked me, "Where are you from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I said, "From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="151">Out." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And then they went further. "</span><span class="sentence" id="153">What are you?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="154">A carpenter." "</span><span class="sentence" id="155">Out." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Things like that, so they picked about 18 to 20 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Well, let me maybe say that we hear in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that that happens with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They kill Jews and they gas Jews and things like that; but we really, as young people, we really didn't believe that something like that is possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We thought, “Maybe the younger people will take to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Maybe only the older people....” You just didn't want to be -- wan-- wanted to believe, because it was so incomprehensible, so unbelievable that something like that can happen that you just -- even if you had the intelligence you didn't believe it, so when they picked us out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I really didn't know what means the picking out means, whether life or death. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So they took us -- the 20 people -- they took us in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the others went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> -- what we found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So we worked in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Went -- in the afternoon, in the afternoon, they took us with all the other people to separate the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">That started to be our work and I started to separate my clothes -- that was the clothes from people who just arrived with the transport what we came with, and while I did that I found the clothes of my brother, the pictures from the family, so I knew already -- they already told me what's going on, so I knew already what happened, that he went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> with my friend and I am here separating his clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So you can imagine what went through my mind when that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">How did you handle that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Well, I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I, I -- everything stopped on me, like I stopped functioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I just -- also I heard all the stories before that didn't penetrate in me, I didn't accepted it, but that made it already accepting. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">That's what happened, because I saw what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So it's hard to tell the feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It's -- it 1s just -- you stop thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You stop functioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It is just like somebody hits you with a hammer in your head, something like that, so -- but you had to do your work. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You were not your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You had to function just to function, to move, to go, to do things like that, so we finished our work and surely constantly in my mind what happened and, and, and that was really our work, what we do, day in, day out and, and then we went back and then after the work they always kept us around five o'clock, before it gets dark, back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , where we, we slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Selma told the work about it was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was a section where the Germans lived, and that was really fixed up nicely with <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And then was <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where we lived, mostly where, we slept in other words. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And there was a few places in the <span class="DLF">park</span> or call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or whatever -- there were also places where they had a shoemaker, a goldsmith, a tailor, a regular smith, things like that, but that was mostly not for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="183">That was mostly work done for the Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="184">What they need some work, they did it; like the goldsmith that did for them good different things, made for them up rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You see, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> really was- that was one of many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , of about four or five <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> what was really a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The distinction is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , people came there, they were directed to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They -- the small group what worked, like us, was just to keep the things going; in other words separating the clothes, cleaning out.... Before we came, before I came, about a few months before, they start, it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">When a transport came, they picked out about 50, 60 people from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and when all the people were already in, gone to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , they cleaned up after them and then these people were shot in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , often in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">later they found out it's more efficient for them to have the same people do always the same work, so they start to have permanent people doing the cleaning up, the separating all the kind of thing, and that what started to be a permanent group in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> what worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And we were the ones what, what did this kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So it was, as I have to explain maybe, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was so as I say we lived apart where the Germans lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We lived, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we worked and there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lager Three</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> , where the people went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and there, there were in the beginning was as burying and later.... Is that the right word?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Buried them. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And later, they came they burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They had a big roaster thing that they burned the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Now, also, we had hard times. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Everyday, almost, they beat you, they, they mistreated you. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They made you working, day and night and all the kind of thing, but you were young and you could take it as much as you could take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Whoever couldn't take it was taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they fell, just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was a change of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Very often a lot of people were changed because they just couldn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They couldn't, physically they couldn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now the people what work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lager Three</span> was often a change of it, because the people worked directly with the bodies and having to work on that, it -- most people, mentally, they just couldn't have it; and they were changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They had to change the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They killed, they killed them and they picked out another group of people and they took them, or they took some of ours or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They took; and if you once came there, you never came out of it because that was the real end, the real end. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Nobody could come out from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself the food what they gave you really was -- we called it a straw soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">That was something you couldn't even swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">You had to spit out and in the morning, black water and a slice of bread for the 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Now if you had to live on that, you couldn't really live there; but because we work with this, clothes, separating the clothes and the people came -- they always brought with them -- you saw -- they couldn't take much with them, the people what got sent on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They just took them from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and say, "Go," so they took with them -- usually what you take, you take with you the valuables what you can in small things like diamonds, rings and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They figure, "They'll let me take something. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">You never know what happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And also some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They took cans of food, things like that, so we were the ones what really worked with that, so knowing that we don't have much to, to eat, so we took the risk to steal this food and we brought it back and we ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Now if they caught you, you were shot on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You had a piece, a can, or whatever, they shot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They didn't even question, ask you nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Just shot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Now lot of times they did it, they caught somebody, they took us out to show what happens if somebody steals, but we still kept doing it, regardless; and so we really had -- sometimes we had food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So even the time when we didn't have the food one evened out with the other, so we were not -- as far as that's concerned, not they fed us but we fed ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We took the food, we stole the food and so we had sometimes from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , we had the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And also, as for clothes, what I mentioned -- people ask you, “In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you look not so bad dressed,” and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Now we work with these clothes, so if, if we had a ripped jacket and we saw another one, we took another jacket and we didn't have special camp clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We had our regular clothes what we came in, so there as far as that, but there was always the -- if you didn't look right or the German maybe had just a drink and he didn't like your look, he took you out and shot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He didn't have to give any account to anybody what he is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He just did whatever he felt like. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Now we had some what we had to be very careful, because they always were suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And if they had any suspicion, justified or not justified, you could be a target of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">What they did, sometimes they took us out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and they, they took us and shot people and things like that, you didn't look right, you didn't walk right. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And also when they took us out on Appell! </span><span class="sentence" id="235">and you didn't stay right, he decided, gives you 25 whips -- they had whips -- 25 whips on the, on the on, on, on your bare, bare bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, I had it a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I got beaten, so, so I took when I was on my work I saw some other pants, so I took two pair of pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I figured if they beat me it wouldn't be so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So they found out that, so I got beaten and I had to take off both my pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And so you got beaten on 25 whips and if you, you had to count it. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">If you didn't -- stopped counting in the middle, you had to start from the beginning and he gave you another 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So that was really one of the minor things. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The main thing was we always were living with that people seeing what we -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that came and they went to these <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> -- men, women, children, and that was always a heart-breaking thing to see and, and that was really.... Ours is beating alright, the next day you were better, but that is not so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But that what we saw what happens, and that what really always touched us. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But, but it is strange that even, even, if you were young and even if you see what happen and you know it's no way out of here, even if you think, "It's just a fantasy," that you think, "T will come out of here all right." </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It just -- you hope, your hope is justified hope -- not justified hope, but you think because your will for life is so -- you think, "Ah, one day I will come out of it." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There was really not any reason to believe it will happen, because it was, it was around with <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> , <span class="DLF">mines</span> around, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , guards around, dogs around, and even if you get out you wouldn't know where to go even. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So there was not really any, any real hope whatever, not any spark of hope there that you would can come out ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But still, you know, ' roll call (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="250">as I say, you're young. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You think -- a matter of fact sometimes being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you're not fully alert, you were not -- you couldn't believe that what happened happens here because it was so far from reality really, thinking that -- how can you imagine -- they burn people -- they, they kill people, young people, children. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You couldn't believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So if you're not really fully aware you thought that is not true, you just dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But really that was, was what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So, in general to say that really what, what was the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So there are different, cases that happened that people -- it is in the movie, is it about -- there was a group what worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , about 10 people, 15 people, whatever; and they went out with two Ukrainians to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Now and there was in this group -- one day, they and were in this, in this Ukraines, the guards -- and they killed one and, and they start to run away, So a few got away and the rest were caught and brought back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And when that happened, they -- we had to go on Appell and they took us to show how they shot all these people and we had to see it as a lesson when you ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">That was one accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">There was another one, a similar story happened something -- somebody ran away so this time they took different. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They took each 10th -- they put us on an Appell and every 10th of the <span class="DLF">line</span> they picked out; and every 10th, the group what they collected from that they took them with them and they shot them together with the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Now I happened to be number nine in a <span class="DLF">line</span> where they picked the 10th of it, so luck was with me somehow I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So they, they shot this group; so things like that happened very, very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I really couldn't recall how many times -- probably Selma told about this -- 72 Dutch people, there was a rumor that they want to ran away so they took the whole 72 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> and they shot them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Things like that happened very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Somebody -- I told you about the -- we were on this trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I testified that Frenzel’, one of the Germans, he shot a dentist for no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We had to see how he put him down and turned around and shot him 1n his back, in the neck here and he fell down, and I testified for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Now that's one of the few cases that I remember things that they did, things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little more about Frenzel and the kinds of things he did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Well, the -- each German was really an, an individual by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Although they all had -- they came for one purpose, just to treat the Jews there, but each one had reacted to his character. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">As I mentioned once, there was one what was there for some whatever reason, but he was not the worst one. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He could give a Jew another piece of bread; but the other one like Frenzel, he looked for trouble not for him, for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He didn't like somebody, he shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He would -- people * Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel would -- sometimes you couldn't go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They were in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He didn't like you are so long there for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He took them out and took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> and they shot all of them, so each individual really was what he was by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It was not a command they had to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Like we had another one, Wagner, what was -- that was the worst one of all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The worst thing about him 1s he was very sharp and very suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">If he has his eye and his intuition and his feeling for so he could smell out something there will be trouble tomorrow, so we were always careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">When he was around - we had a name for him, "VaYikru". </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Now that means -- we called him "VaYikru," because we didn't want any name, popular name, that you don't recognize it, so we knew when we said -- when he came near to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we said "VaYikru," so everybody knew to be alert and out of his way because it always happened with him something. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He always took somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He killed him or he beat him or whatever, so we always were very careful as far as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So what I want to point out, the claim that these guards say they had to do the things, are definitely not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">First of all, a lot of time they asked for volunteers because they didn't want to work they went there, but they were not commanded to particularly shoot this one or do this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Their function was to go there and to see that if work functions, that the people go, come from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and do the things, but each individual showed his character there and when he was one what he wanted to hurt personally something, he did it there; and he didn't have to give any, any account of it, what he 1s doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So the Frenzel was really one of the bad ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He, he really -- if he could kill people, he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">we had one, for example, what worked in Lager Three and he used to be a boxer, Gomerski’, and for him they made a special whip what was heavier and one day he came back from Lager Three and we were on Appell and he came -- this Frenzel was with us -- and he was bragging to Frenzel -- we understood, we speak German -- so he says to him that he just killed a Jew with 12 hits with his whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So, so they chose that each character lived out his character there. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">It was not that he had to do that; they did it, so the excuse that they had to that is nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So, there's -- well, also my work was separating clothes when transport came at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Sometimes they took people out any time, anybody to do different kind of works. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">What they did, they cut the hair of the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The women went to the gas chamber after the men and then they stopped, about one or two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> before the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where they left their luggage and they had to undress; and there was a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> the next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> where they cut at randomly, they cut the hair of the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They utilized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They send it back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ; they did for brushes, for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So we were sometimes picked out at night to cut the hair, and it happens once I happened to be one of this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I had to go also to cut the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Now we were about 10 feet from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">There was -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> was here and there was like the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> like I say next to it so and they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">If the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish transports</span> were-- the Polish Jews knew more what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They knew they're going to death and also they were more religious and the women came in * Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner * Oberscharfiihrer Hubert Gomerski and we were young boys, 20, 22, five, and we were standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They came naked in, and we had to cut their hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">There was a horrible yelling and screaming for all these, from knowing, from feeling they go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">On top of that, they're ashamed to put it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch transport</span> , was quieter. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They didn't know really -- they didn't realize really that they're going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to death, so I have I happened to cut somebody's hair and they started to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Say, "How, how is it here and what...?" </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They still didn't believe already, and the Germans around the small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but a little bigger than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So they around so we couldn't, we couldn't talk to them so I didn't say a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I couldn't, because they didn't want us we talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They were afraid we tell them or things like that, so we couldn't say anything, but that was a horrible thing to see these women with children and all ages and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I mean know -- we knew where would they go. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So as I say hard to, to tell this picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They cut randomly the hair, something like they chopped up down here and send away those people, so to the lowest point these people were brought down when they went to the.... It's, it's unbelievable how takes it to tell that. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Whoever didn't see it cannot describe it how that really looks or feeling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We were always were sick from it when we came back from that, but as I say that was random. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Sometimes they took us to this kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And, we had other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Like for example we had one times we had, on a Sunday was that and they locked us up in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We were not allowed to go out and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived and there came some, some people came 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And there was full with guards and all the guards were in, all the Germans and everything, and they took them further down where they usually people arrive and they go and take their luggage and we heard a lot of shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So much shooting and shooting, we didn't know what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">The next day they took us to work to separate the clothes, and we're separating the clothes from these people what were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They're full with blood -- terrible, and, and while we are separating the clothes we -- I found in a pocket of one of these of one of these trousers -- I found a little note written in Yiddish and it says, "We come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> ," what was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like that and where the people that did the kind of work that we do; and to liquidate the Belzec, they brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And the people knew where they go, so they put a resentment, so they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They just shot them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so all these people, and they say, and the note says, "We are from there, we know where we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Take revenge for us." </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So that was -- we knew the people or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So our hopes for coming out was really no hopes whatever, no hopes whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We knew what the end is. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It's just if the transport are finished, we are finished and we go and we will be shot, all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I don't remember, there's so many de-- so many accidents -- incidents that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> what so horrible I really don't come to fresh in my mind to tell what it is, but stories like that happened almost every other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Almost every other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was if we lived through a day -- if we made it through the day, if you make it to the evening you know you lived today. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Otherwise you didn't know what tomorrow is, because tomorrow morning if he didn't like what you looked like, you could be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Constantly like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So we lived with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It is hard to say how you live a life like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">You just live with the minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">You don't make plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You don't think far. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You don't -- you concentrate, you just concentrate on the minute, "I want to make the, the first 10 minutes, the next minute, the next minute," and that is the way we really lived because, it's really impossible to explain what it means to live in a situation like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And nobody -- if somebody tries to say something about -- it's impossible to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Even the one what lived it through couldn't explain really how that was, to live like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So -- but -- and there was a group what, was thinking of, of running away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Let's hold it for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Before we get to the uprising, we -- would you tell me, um, how you met your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  I guess by at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">By at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Because we worked in with separating the clothes and in the evening we came back to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The men and women lived in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> , or big -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was circled round with barbed wire and woven with branches from the green- evergreen <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and -- but there was many <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">There was a section where the women slept and we slept in another. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was there and the <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> were they set, so in the evening when we arrived they gave us to eat something and, and then we have about nine o'clock or eight-thirty depending when it was dark, we had to go and sleep in our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , so the few hours between eating and sleeping so we could see each other, walk around in this half of this, <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , <span class="BUILDING">court</span> round and we could talk with each other; and I, and I met Selma. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">She probably knows the details better than I do, but anyway we met and we stayed always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I think that also was really a -- that makes it also easier, subconsciously, easier for us to endure 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we had each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">We liked each other, and we could, communicate together and we were young, so I think it's a normal reaction to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  How did you see -- keep seeing her, given the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the way it was set up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Well, we tried to be as much as we can together. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">In other words when we went on Appell, we tried to be together and, when -- after work we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So we worked, we went separating the clothes, if possible, we were together, so we were pretty often and pretty — very -- and very often together as far as the work didn't interfere with -- if the work wasn't the same <span class="NPIP">location</span> , the same thing, we could be together with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  You had started before to tell us about some of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Can you tell us about Wagner? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Can you tell me the story about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">well, Wagner, as I said, was really somebody the most we had to be careful with. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">He was the most brutal one and a vicious one. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">He was really -- he looked for the occasion to murder somebody, to do some something bad to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He was, he was himself and he had the occasion to do things like that, so he very often he sneaked tn at night, you know, or in the evening when we are just walking around in this <span class="DLF">lot</span> , in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we lived, just to, to, to sneak out, to suspicious, to see something. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Maybe he's stalking to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I know he went in once to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , one of -- there was a young fellow, he was a Kapo and he slept, and he went in, in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he start to wake him and he wasn't reacting quick enough so he took him out with a -- he killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He killed him because he didn't react rightly on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">A matter of fact, the uprising later maybe I will tell -- we geared it so -- they went every three months they went on vacation, so we all -- we planned it to have anything -- when we planned the uprising we planned it so that he 1s not 1n that time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He is on vacation in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Now, while I'm talking about reminds me, the Germans went every, as I say, every three months they went to vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Now when they do that, when they went there, they always prepared them to go on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">What that mean 1s, they took all the best clothes what they could find, they -- some of the valuables what the people had with them -- that they had the biggest suitcase and they filled up all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They filled it up till they couldn't even carry it, it was so heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And each, each one of them took <span class="BUILDING">home</span> these big suitcases and with especially the Dutch people brought really nice things with them, and they took all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They took them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for themselves, so that was really for them a big holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">To go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they took with them valuables what never more could -- they probably in their private life could never afford this kind of things, so, that was really what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So, that that really was for them, that was the purpose of being there, so they could steal and take the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">On top of that what they murdered, that they could steal and take the things with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Now Wagner, the end of Wagner was after the war, he ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">He ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and one of the survivors, Szmajzner’, what he recently died -- he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , too; and when it was Hitler's birthday, they, all these Germans make a coming together and he happens to be there and this Szmajzner, Szmajzner, he, he somehow found out that he saw that -- he went looking for these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">He saw him there and he recognized him, and he said, "You are Wagner." </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He said, "No, no, no." </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Anyway, it ended up that they took him to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and while he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> he hanged himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So that was the story with Wagner. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But while being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we were really -- if we were afraid to the most it was for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So really that was really a beast. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He, he was so vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">He was looking already that he can murder somebody, kill somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I never saw a person like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Some of them still had sometimes, human feelings, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">You could caught them, and catch them in a lighter moment, but this one was really just vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">You couldn't afford even to look in his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He didn't like you look at him and things like that, so there were -- before me were there even also were others what I didn't -- Stangl®, I think, but I, I didn't -- I was not in the time when Stang] was. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I don't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I only from I heard from the others telling -- he had a dog and he martyred people with the dog and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Now I, I was not my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I came in, in — no — yeah, I came I think in September 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So I was 11 months I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because the uprising was in October, so that was not my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">there was transport > Stanislaw Szmajzner ° SS-Hauptsturmfihrer Franz Stangl came really -- sometimes they came -- I remember just talking about -- I remember there came a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">There was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and there was a lot of people, half-dead, dead, no clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Terrible, I never saw something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It's just unbelievable -- half-skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The people looked just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They must have had a big trip, no food, muddled up before that, so they want to get it over as quick as possible, so we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span> , like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> what you have in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> , what you swing back and forth, you might have seen them. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So they said all the bodies we had to throw on, on this to take it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And there were half-live people. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We just had to throw them together with the, with the live people -- with the dead people together, so I see an old lady, a gentle face and things like that and it was on top of all these bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">She couldn't hardly talk, and they all went just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Put half-life on, whatever lived still, on the fire there. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So things like that really -- I couldn't -- I, I couldn't bring up everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was so many of them I couldn't really remember everyone of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It was horrible, horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I just don't have words for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You cannot, you cannot, you cannot tell a story like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">You can tell a story, the words have not the same meaning to the listener that 1t has to me, because I saw it and I see the picture before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And it's different telling a story -- no matter how good words you find for it, it still cannot give you the right picture what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So that is to say the most horrible thing imaginable, that what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">If you, you cannot imagine, but, but if you could have a horrible picture of the worst of a picture, the picture, even if I were to tell 1t, because so bad was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  What kind of food and living conditions did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, we all got -- the food was -- you had in the -- we got -- well in the morning we got our slice of bread, a heavy slice of bread, black bread and black water. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was not to drink but that's all you get, and in the evenings we had a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">As I said, we called it the straw soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was from corn, I don't know exactly the name of it, it's with the peels, the corn with the peels, so you couldn't really swallow that and we called that the "spit soup." </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Now some people couldn't eat it and they just didn't eat and die. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They couldn't eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Especially the Dutch people, what were used to a little bit better life, so they couldn't, and if you had to live on that you couldn't make it long. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">You couldn't make it long, and they -- a lot of people didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But we were the ones who were next to the food and we stole it. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">That's the reason we had more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was illegal, dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They would have shot you if they catch you, but we nevertheless we did it, so the -- as far as food concerns, that was really the situation, but if you think about how they fed you -- forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">You couldn't make it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">You couldn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And, clothes -- as I said, we came with different clothes and we just changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">If, 1f it was ripped or whatever, we changed to another clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Just that what kind of thing, but they didn't supply you anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They gave you -- they treated you like a commodity, not like a, a human being, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You were not a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">You just had to listen the order what you got and to do it, just like the robot. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You had to do things what you are told and if you didn't do it right, they did away with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">No fooling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And then was, a punishment for whatever reason, the whole evening instead after eating we could go and be in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They didn't bring you to eat and they take you around, running around, put down -- as a punishment; they let you ran, ran, and ran, fell down and get up, fell down and get up for hour, two hours, till you got so exhausted and tired, some people died on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They couldn't make it, and some, the younger ones, they, they did it, so there was a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Things like that happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">As I say, they tried to martyr you. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They tried to take away any thinking of you, that you don't -- you're not on a human being, you're not functioning as a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Just you have to be a robot and to kill you, any thinking, any initiative, anything -- just to do what you're told and to keep you as long as they need you. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So we really were not human beings in their thinking and their functioning and in regard to us, so they didn't come for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So they exploit us as much as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  At this point I want to stop and pause and we're going to change tapes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="462">Technical Conversation] End of Tape 1 TAPE #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We're on. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Let's pick up now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  Well, we were always knowing what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We were talking about an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">In other words, we talking about running away somehow, organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">There was a small group. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was not involved in this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And there was a lot of talking about how to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Now there were many plans how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was not an easy task. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">There were always <span class="DLF">mines</span> around, guards around, and there were about a 150, 200 Ukrainian guards in the camp on top of the Germans, so that was really a very difficult task to find somehow a way to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And -- till one day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That was about -- on -- not far from the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> where the Germans caught them, the prisoners of war, so they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">From this group they picked out around 30 people to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and these people when they came in and they heard what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They're all soldiers so, and a different spirit, said they want to run away the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So we tried to explain to them that it is not so easy. “</span><span class="sentence" id="479">Where do you run? </span><span class="sentence" id="480">You don't have the cooperation from the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> even if you make it already <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and, it's not so easy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And we told them also that we have our own plans and we wanted to do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Maybe we can talk together and come up with a common things, and we all can do the same thing together, what made sense, and they agreed on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And after many secretive meetings in the evening, we, after work, we came together and we talk with them and we talked on different plans, different possibilities, so -- till one day we came upon a plan that we make an uprising on this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We worked till it was the time of October, what about five o'clock they brought us back already to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> because they want us always bring back before dark, so we decided at four o'clock we start to make an uprising in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">In each group what worked like we, for example, with separating the clothes; we had two three Germans what were supervision over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They supervised us and each group what worked in different ways had two or three Germans what they were there to watch them, how they work. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So we decided in each group to assign two people and these people with some pretext, they will have to get them to a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> or somewhere and quietly kill them with a knife or an axe or whatever and just do it like nothing happened and in, in the meantime also to cut the, the wires and as I said, as I said before, we tried to gear to do it in the time when Wagner was on vacation; so that was really not safe, but safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And that was -- and so as I say, we was assigned people in each group to do this kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Now there were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where we lived, there was a goldsmith, a tailor, a shoemaker and that they made for them clothes, shoes, these people there; so they made, they had to come to fit, so they told them, "In this day I will have the fit for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Come then, and I will have the fit for you your shoes or your clothes." </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And when they came there they were already people with this axe of knives. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They were hiding behind a, a curtain or something, and they killed them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">When they came in to fit, they overwhelmed them and they killed them, and shoved them in under the, under somewhere that nobody sees, and, and the work went through like nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And so I was not assigned to anything because, you see, I went with Selma and Selma didn't speak Polish and the whole plan was very secretive. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Although it was planned for all of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because everybody could run away, but not many people were told were about -- be afraid it might come out, leak out and then we all gone, so whoever was, didn't speak the language, didn't know somebody, so it was secretive. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So I had my friends there and I knew everything that's going on; but I was not assigned to anything because of that, because I was with, with Selma, because she didn't speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So where I worked there, there were some people assigned to kill by the clothes where I worked, the separating the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And then there were two people what assigned to go to kill somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , a German in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and the last minute one of them got scared and he didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I was there and I heard the story and I knew already that there's 10 to 12 Germans were already killed, so I know -- the ordeal I know already. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We are already -- unless we get out, otherwise we are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So, Selma brought me a knife with a point, knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I said I wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You see, from all these people what people brought from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , utensils and all the things, there were a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for it, and we're not far from this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , so she went there in and she picked a knife, a pointed knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">She gave me a knife, and I went with the other fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I don't think I was a big hero or a big, courageous man, but I figured it's self-defense and survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">If I don't do it, it might spoil the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So I, I instinctively -- is not decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It's not a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">You just react, instinctively you react to that, and I figured, "Let us to do, and go and do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I went with the man in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and we killed this German. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">With every jab, I said, "That is for my father, for my mother, for all these people, all the Jews you killed;" and I -- my knife slipped out, slid out from my hand and I cut myself and I was full with blood and when he was dead we ran out of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Just came a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came with Germans on it, but I somehow -- there was -- the, the idea was when at this comes five o'clock that we all go back to from work to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> like nothing happened, and that was just in that time and Selma went with this group and she saw me and she took a, a nap-- napkin or whatever she had with them, she tied me up there, wiped off the blood from me and I went with this group till the main <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> where we where we came in and all the groups in all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> came in, because it was five o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Then we all start to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Everybody ran in different directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I tell it so quick, but, it, 1t was more tension because it was a whole hour was going on, so we were very tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We knew there were already Germans killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We knew already it's going on, so we just hoped that nobody unexpectedly comes a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he doesn't supposed to come and finds out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">If that 1s, then we all killed and lost, so somehow we are lucky with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We killed these Germans wherever we worked and everything went accordingly to the plan, till we came to the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Now we could -- people ran, ran all over, so the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> knew already what's going on by then, so some ran on the <span class="DLF">mines</span> , got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Some people didn't ran at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They didn't want to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They just gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They, they just waited till they get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But the younger people, most of them, and whoever was courageous enough to run, they ran away and then a lot ran on the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Now we started to run and we were next to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and then I saw Frenzel with a machine gun, and he started to shoot and more people were running and I, I wanted to hold back because afraid for the machine gun, and I figured, "Here is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Here is maybe something." </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So I pulled Selma's hand and we ran through and somehow, some fell and we made it through the through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So we were lucky we came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So that is really, I think some luck was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So we came through that and then we ended up -- it started to be dark, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , so when we came out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we ended up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and it was rainy and it was wet and she had some boots on and somehow the boots didn't right, so she pulled it off and she couldn't get it on, so she ran with one boot, half on the foot and on the, on the heel like that, you know, she ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We ran the whole night and we didn't know where we ran; and till it started to get light, dawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And what I forgot to tell you is when we knew when we go away, we took money from the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The money what we should have given to the Germans or sabotage, we took with us some because we figured if we go out, we probably will need it if we have any chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So we took some with us, so when we came -- we figured -- the first night we came next to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we saw a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I figured, "Let me go and ask if they can keep us over the day," because they were searching there all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So, and I told them I -- whatever the figure was -- I had dollars, gold, things like that, so I told them I would give them so much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">He probably never heard so much money what I gave him, so he agreed to hold us over the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And it happened we were six miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And later we heard that in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they were searching the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They found a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I don't know if all of them -- they found of them and took them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And it happened we were lucky, they didn't, didn't find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So, and then we, we, we ran, we - no -- when it got dark, we left this farmer and he told us a little direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Now I was thinking because I didn't know where to go, what to go, so I was thinking I worked at the farmer before I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , I figured, "Let me try. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Maybe, you never know, maybe -- he was a nice person as I said, he was a nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Maybe he might do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Now I didn't know direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We couldn't go on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We went in the <span class="DLF">field</span> always, because we are afraid they will catch us and not to be found, so we went in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">We didn't -- what we looked is on the, on the Big Wagen’, on Der Nipper’, Nipper. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I don't know I went the right direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Anyway, that was our guide to where to go where to go, so we ended up at ’ <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> (German); “Der Groke Wagen” or “The Big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wagon</span> ” is a colloquial German term for the constellation Ursula Major. * </span><span class="sentence" id="556">the sipper (German) night, we walked in dark, and during the day we tried to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Either, we tried to go into a farmer in the morning, very early in the morning, give him money; or sometimes we were not so lucky so we were hiding in sometimes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> during the day or on an open <span class="DLF">field</span> or we went in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hoykh barg</span> ” or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And one day we couldn't find a farmer, we couldn't find anybody, and we ended up on a top of a high <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> ’, and it happened during the day some children came there to play and there was a sport to go on this and they found us, and they started right, "Jews, Jews, Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I said, "Selma, let's quick run away," and we ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They couldn't find anyone, so we ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I don't know, we got out and while we were running there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> haul-- wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They didn't know that I speak Polish, and he said, "Come, we will take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Come, we'll take you." </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And I was on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and Selma was on the other one, and I hear in Polish they say, "Let them take it -- we will, we will do something for them," whatever -- not, not good, so I screamed to Selma, "Jump! </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Jump!" </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I jumped and she jumped, and I let them go and we went away, SO We ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So for about two weeks we ran, sometimes coming to a farmer, sometimes not, but every time when we were at a farmer, we tried to tell them that we have some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">We want to give them this money, and if he wants to keep us over the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It was already in the end of '43 and, the Russians moved back and forth, so, so maybe they figured that maybe it wouldn't take so long and they might willing to do it, till one day we came to a farmer and we asked him that. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And he said, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I am too near to my neighbors and I am not able to do it for you, but I have a brother of mine what lives about 10 miles away or 10 kilometers away. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Let me bring you there to him and maybe -- he lives a little isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">He might be willing to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And that what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So he put Selma, dressed up some as an old lady, and me he put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , the long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> what they had, covered me with branches and he drove on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Now I don't think he realized the danger of what he imposed on himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">If they caught us, if the Germans on the <span class="DLF">road</span> caught us, we all had been dead and all his family dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Of course, really very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I assume he didn't realize what he is doing, because that was so dangerous and they were all over, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And especially they were look-- we were not too far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> anyway, so they were looking for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So anyway we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He brought us to his brother, and his brother said, "Yes, I can keep you." </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So there we end up -- we gave him what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Don't ask me what it was, was -- gold pieces, diamonds, things like that, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Anyway, we gave him all these things and he decided to keep us, and he put us on top of the cows on the straw -- made a -- more straw put on and, and then, a bucket for your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and once a day he brought us some food, and he kept us there for -- that was in October -- he kept us till June 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">That was, when the Russians came, till the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> , till, till the Weichsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The war was -- the Russian came already in '44 till the Weichsel -- there was six months no fi-- no fighting in this <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">You said he kept you. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Describe where he kept you and how ” high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> (Yiddish) '” mountain(Yiddish) you were given and all of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  Well, as I say, we were where the cows were downstairs it was full with flies on the top and we could never get straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Once in a while he took us down for -- to wash ourselves, and the food -- we had once a day food. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It was not enough but at least we could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Selma had sca-- scab-- the right word, is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Scabies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  Scabies. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">She had scabies, and we knew with -- we knew.... What is the material you use on matches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  Sulfur.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Sulfur. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Sulfur. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And with that you could get rid of it, so we didn't have any money more. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I remember I had a gold-filled, a gold, pen, a fountain pen, and I gave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I said, "Why don't you sell that and buy us this sulfur," so -- and then he had to drive to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So I think that what he did once, but it was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So we ended up she had sulfur all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So, she -- we lived with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I had it too, so we had it both. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We had to -- so I was not so, contagious to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I didn't have it so bad, but she had it very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They, they treated us well. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">This how you want to think about: we were lucky and happy that they kept us alive and they gave us whatever food they gave us; and also no matter what condition, because we knew, we knew somehow a friend of ours what also was asking a farmer to keep him, and he said, "Keep me." </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And at night he came with the hay fork and killed him and took all the money from him, so knowing all this kind of things, we were, we thought-- [Beeping noise]
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Can we stop the tape please? [</span><span class="sentence" id="615">Technical conversation |
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We're back on tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  So, knowing that, that what can happen, so we really felt very lucky that we find people that they kept us, no matter what conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So that's the way always we look at it, because they saved our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Now, when the Russian -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">A few days before the Russian came, somehow a family child came from-- eight years, 10 years or whatever years old--he came to this uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">That was his uncle, and he came to, to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Now a bird happens to fly up there where we were, and he climbed up and he saw us, and he was.... That was a secret for the family, because nobody knew what's going -- they had young children, one or two, so nobody knew and when they saw that so that was really dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But two days later the Russian came, so we came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We came down and the Russians, saw -- we saw the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We all -- before we heard already the Germans leaving and the shooting of the big guns came nearer and nearer till the Ger-- Russian came, so then we were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So when we came out from there, so he brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelm</span> , what is about 10 kilometers from where we were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And then we found more Jews there and so, you know, there was from all different <span class="NPIP">places</span> came different Jews were hidden or whatever, or were with the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Somehow, I don't know what happened exactly in that time but, after a short time we moved away. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We went away, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And, and then we ended up in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parczew</span> , the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Now, Selma was pregnant at that time and when we came out, she went, she had a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parczew</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and then we move already with the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parczew</span> what I started to do to make a living is where the Germans left, was there to buy things to bring to the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived, because there was- where we lived was nothing, and where the Germans were there was more, so I tried to hitchhike and travel some and bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">It tooks me one time a week or two weeks till I came to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I bought things and I brought it back and I sold it, so that's the way we make our living, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">When I sold the things, I went for a new trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But Selma was always alone, not speaking the language, with a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So there was her friend, what she mentioned before, her friend -- there was also a Dutch girl, this, Ula Stern, and she was a good friend for her before. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So I decided that she come -- she came from the partisans and she had a hard time and she couldn't go by herself, so I said, "Why don't she come and live with us," so Selma has company and not alone for all the time I am away. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And that is the way we kept her for a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">She was with us, and I was traveling back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">till one day they say they go to kill all the Jews at night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parczew</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The partisans go to kill all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So, I said to Selma, "Now we go." </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We tooks, took some -- I had some freight, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or something like that, somehow; somebody took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to some Jews what was other survivor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , and he was one of the two what ran away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when they <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , what I told you, they had the two Ukrainian guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They killed one and they ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He was one of the two what survived, so he had there -- he was already longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">He was -- some business did, whatever, and he took in Jews and they took us also in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Podchlebnik'’. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Podchlebnik. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He died in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He, he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> not far from, Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">He died a few years ago, some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So anyway, and so we were with him for a little time and I did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I bought whatever I could and sell that we could make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">till one day, one day we heard there was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> -- it was a bigger place- there was also a lot of Dutch prisoners of war what were freed by the Germans, so there was some more Dutch people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and somehow, either through the Red Cross or ‘ Shlomo Podchlebnik whatever, they organized into bring them back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , bring them back from the Russian- | don't know from where, but it went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So they start to concentrate all these Dutch people together. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Now Selma was Dutch, but I was not Dutch and I didn't speak the language, so it was a little of problem, so I tried to talk as much -- as little as I talk I talked less, and so I didn't talk at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I tried to be like I'm also Dutch but I don't talk too much and we happened to have -- Selma got acquainted -- there was a Dutch officer what he happened to be a nice man and she told him about me, so he tried to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He helped me that I don't have to come and to tell things like that, so and I went through as a Dutch person. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I went through as a Dutch person, not much exposed you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">That was always my policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Keep away as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">If I could avoid seeing or talking to any of the Germans, things like that, I was always on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I tried to be not around ‘less I had no choice, so I figured the less that I am exposed, the, the less chances I have to be hurt, so here the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I kept like as much as I could I avoid everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I just went, went with the masses. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Now I'm not -- to don't know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And that probably helped, and then they took us, because the war was still going on, to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Weichsel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">In other words from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> Weichsel till that was still a front, so they brought us through <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> , if you can picture it, through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> to the Mediterranean to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But to come so far they took us -- we had to go with -- they brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">there was -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was split in half, with -- they maked a <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> of, a division, so half that more people can go -- there was an up and down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> , you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They make a division that people lived downstairs upstairs and slowly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">For three months we make it till <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They must have given us some food because we got some food from them and, sometimes the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped so we could go, to facilities or washing something quick because we had the baby and so -- but, we made it till <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> and then they kept us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> till our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They kept us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">What we got I think from the Red Cross, we got some packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The Red Cross supplied some packages and so that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , and then came, one day came the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> supposed us to take to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Now there was really a strict control on that, because I came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And there was one girl, she said she 1s Dutch; they found out she is not Dutch, so the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> left and this one girl -- still seeing stand there -- she couldn't go with. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and crossed my fingers that everything, already we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> the child -- probably Selma told the story -- the child got sick from food poisoning. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They gave it -- this, this was the powdered milk or whatever, was too strong or whatever, and then the stomach and there was no medication, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So the child died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> during -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aegean Sea</span> , next to Nexon-- <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Naxos Island</span> , was the child was buried there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , and we arrived later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> they kept us for a day or two till we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Now the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , probably Selma told more pri-- more about than I, so that's basically the way we ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I stayed till -- we arrived in '45 and, we left '51. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">About six and a half year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  And you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We came -- Selma didn't like <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and also it was for me hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , if you wanted to start a business, you have to have some special permit and you cannot just start a business like here: you go out, you open four <span class="DLF">walls</span> and put in merchandise, you have a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So it was a hard time for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Now I had also from Selma's family was a permit like that what I could get and I got and I got <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we started in the textile business, and we didn't begin -- we did very well, and later my partner just, cheated me out and I, we lost all the money and I had -- I couldn't start another business so I was decided to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So Selma always wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I liked to go <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ; so to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was a Polish quota and it was very hard and -- but to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we could go easier, so I decided, "Let's go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So we sold everything we had and we -- in the meantime we bought, built a new <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we had, a whole and everything and in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we sold that everything, and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in, like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moshav Shittufi</span> , what we lived on our own but we worked together. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But I was not I think made for this kind of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I, I, I couldn't -- from the first day on I said to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selma</span> , "How do we go back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I, I couldn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I was in the age about 40— what was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Forty-two? </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Forty-four? </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And I had to go every so often to the military for, to the army for six weeks and I had enough with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> with all the kind of things, and I didn't feel like that, so from the first day on my mind starts to work how to get away from it, how to go <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And, I worked -- I couldn't be in this Moshav Shittufi. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I couldn't live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I was really mentally sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I went -- I worked specially two weeks together that I can have two days to go away for the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We got a free day, so I went to an uncle's of her in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carmel</span> for the two days to look for something else, so when I came there and Selma told him that I am sick there, she couldn't believe it, because I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I was in another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I didn't have this problem, so I really -- my mind went already to come out, at least from that, because that was a dead-end for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I knew where I'll be buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I knew, what tomorrow will lead me. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">You know, you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moshav Shittufi</span> , is taking care of you, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They know what you eat today and what you get tomorrow and where you'll be buried and if you are sick, instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They know everything about you and I couldn't live this life. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">It was -- I had -- and all my private initiative went and I just couldn't stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I couldn't stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So I ended up, I ended up -- we brought with us a lot of things where we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We brought with us Frigidaire, what was in that time was in very scarce in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and '<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">frigerator</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span> and all the things; so we had something we could sell what had a value. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So I decided we'd go. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We ended up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Dutch families lived there and the people said, "Oh, why don't you come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">You find a some job and you do something," and things like that, so I went out for it and I looked and I found someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I, I started to be -- I, I said, "What can I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I have no special trade and I don't money to start a business, so I ended up I wanted to go as a waiter, I work as a waiter. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I worked there for two months, the summer season or things like that; and in the meantime we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beth Yitzhak</span> , next to these people and it happened in the same Beth Yitzhak was there a woman what had a <span class="BUILDING">vegetable store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And, and these Dutch people we met, he said, "You know, you should buy this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ," he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="732">It's really a -- you, you will make money. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">If you don't have enough I will give you some money and you borrow some money and start this business," and what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I took this -- I said first, "How can you have, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where everybody grows everything, how can you sell vegetables?" </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Anyway, it worked out good and I opened in two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , two more business; what I went one or twice I went there, and we made a good living and made good money with it, and, so I got a little money and I start to think how do I come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ‘cause I didn't want to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So through different -- talking with people, things like that, I could find out that there's a way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I was very desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I wanted to do anything just to go, till I came one day and through the uncle I got an affidavit here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and, and so I went it up and we went, we went in '57, we went, we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I don't know what the reason, had with me two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">and we were through the way we stopped in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , that's the way the schedule went and then we came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Now, our plan was to go -- Selma had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and we thought we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> just being a little while with him, and then we start whatever starting and we can go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Well, we couldn't do that because if you have a permit to come here, you have to come here first, so were in a dilemma. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We didn't know what to do, so it happens in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westport</span> , excuse me, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westport</span> was a family what came from the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were living, came to a sister of hers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westport</span> , and so we had written to them that, so they said, "No problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Come to us." </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So we came to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">They live in a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">One, two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and they said, "Come, just live with us," so we went there for a week and we rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he worked at <span class="BUILDING">Gristede's</span> , as like a clerk at <span class="BUILDING">Gristede's</span> , so he got me a job there for taking orders on the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I didn't understand the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I didn't know even what the material what they told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Anyway I hold out there for five weeks, for five months, hold out. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">As I said, we had a little money with us, and, saved a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">With the little bit I made I saved and we bought something else and we started to do our own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And we built it up and we ended up having another business and then, we ended up having a <span class="BUILDING">jewelry store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">That 1s, briefly told, my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So--
QUESTION:  Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Well, we always say when I talk to the children in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , we always tell them that they should be always alert when something happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">You shouldn't minimize if you see something like you see the Ku Klux Klan or the skin-heads or the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">You said, "Ah," you minimize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They said, "What is -- it's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Forget about them." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Don't minimize it, because Hitler also started very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">You never know how it can grew, whether I believed that here is it not the same situation, that 1s too many minorities here to be able to have something like that, but it is not an impossibility, so I think we always can think about it is possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Don't minimize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">If you see something, react to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Don't say it is nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It is nothing in the moment, so that's the reason if you get a reminder or if you get to the B'nai Brith or everything, they warn you, they tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">You think, "Ah, they always come up with the new story." </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It is very important because we cannot prevent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Eventually it might happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I hope not in our generation, not our children's generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We were scapegoat all the years, and we have to be very alert. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">We still, we still went through the whole story so we know more about. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Surely our children will know less about, so, so we still -- the survivors or the people what generation what went through or were part of it, should really understand that don't, you don't minimize things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They can grow. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">From a small seeds can grow a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I think that is what I wanted to add, unless you have questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  Chaim, thank you very much.</span></p>
