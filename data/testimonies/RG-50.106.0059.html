<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  And your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  My mother was also Welsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Her name was Mary Elizabeth Peugh {ph}. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And she was a very good singer. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">In fact, she and my father met, I think, when -- at a temperance meeting, you know, against drinking, where she was a soloist and he was a speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And that was in <span class="COUNTRY">Wales</span> many, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And, well, she had a major job, obviously, was bringing up The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">She had four children under three, twins and two more right off just after they were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And then there was a <span class="DLF">gap</span> and then four more, so she was busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And she was also very active in the life of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  So what was the atmosphere in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Very much family oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I want to divert, I think one of the great tragedies of today's life is the fact that so many kids grow up without families. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I can't imagine not having grown up in a family, as part of a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And, obviously, when I was -- by the time was five or six my oldest brothers had already gone off to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But we all came back for Christmas, and I can still remember the family gatherings at Christmas and other special occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My two sisters ran a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and two of my brothers also became ministers and the other brother was a businessman and then there was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And, well, we lived through some difficult times. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">A minister's salary, I don't know about nowadays, but in those days was not very adequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And we lived through First, when I was born in 1914, right at the beginning of the First World War, and so my father had to bring up eight children. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And so we were all very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My sisters realized that being two ladies amongst- two girls amongst -- with six boys, that unless they put their foot down very early on they would finish up by being kind of housekeepers. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So we all had duties, somebody had to do the washing out, somebody else had to clean all the shoes, somebody else had to make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And we were a fairly close-knit family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  And did you have chores also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You have to wash up. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They say that the male members of my generation of our family were marvelous husbands because they all had this training from their sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and

<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Yes, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was a -- it was a very good experience, one I wouldn't have missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It was a very tough experience because when you are at a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> away from your parents, a long way away from your parents, school discipline is quite tough, but as I say, I wouldn't have missed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then I -- when I came back to -- to when I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I went into business and worked for a big international company, Kelly's Directory of Merchants, Manufacturers and Shippers of the World. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then I worked for one of the big <span class="BUILDING">building societies</span> , I think they are called mortgage and loan societies here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Oh, I went through -- I graduated from this <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">In those days, going to one of those <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> was considered very adequate education. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Some of the -- can I stop for a minute?</span></p>

QUESTION:  You were about 25 years old then when the war started?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And before the war started I had been involved somewhat with the Quakers and their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And, in fact, my wife is a Basque from the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the British government sent over a mission to bring over children from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to look after them while the war was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The idea was that it would be a temporary arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And with every 40 children they sent one teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And they asked various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> all over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> if they would take one group of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I was working, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span> , said they would take a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they asked for volunteers, and I volunteered to help prepare the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> where the kids were going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then later they asked me if I would go and live in the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> , because there were 40 children and two girls, two teachers, a teacher and a teacher's aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And there were a lot of chores to do about the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they wanted some manpower, so they asked me to go live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I went to live in the The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> every day as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Now, was this your first association with the Quakers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Had you done other kinds of volunteer -- other volunteer work similar to that previously?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  But that had some special appeal to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Well, I was there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The children came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span> , and then one of my friends was a Quaker, who was very much involved in developing this project. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And he said, you know, we need somebody to help, how about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I said, fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  So it was through a friend in large part?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  A friend, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So then also I had some kind of sympathy with the Quaker point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In fact, I was a conscientious objector during the war and worked on the <span class="REGION">land</span> when I was called up, and had in the meantime registered with the Quakers as a volunteer for any work they wanted me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And in 1944 --
QUESTION:  Could you -- could we back up? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Could you say a little bit more about the working on the <span class="REGION">land</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You were called up for the Army and you said that you were a conscientious objector?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  I went to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and they were very fair, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They listened to what I had to say and their first response was, well, we think you are quite sincere, but wrong, and so you had better go work in the Army medical corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I said, no, I wouldn't do that because that would mean I wouldn't be bearing witness that I was a conscientious objector because The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and I would be wearing a cocky uniform like everybody else and I wouldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And so then they went back and forth some more. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And they came back and said, in that case you will work on the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I said, well, that's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  So you did that in what capacity? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Was it a government unit that you were with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Well, no, they gave me so many days to find a job on the <span class="REGION">land</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  And I went to one of the local farmers and he looked at me in my office clothes and kind of grinned and he said, well, I disagree with you, but I need -- we need workers, and if you want to come and work for me, you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But you are going to have to work as a -- just like a laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">There is no fancy business. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And so I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I worked on the <span class="REGION">land</span> and --
QUESTION:  Was that a difficult decision for you to make? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">To take that course?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yeah, because -- because lots of people that I very greatly admired disagreed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">My own family --
QUESTION:  Your family disagreed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Well, they didn't support me. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I mean, my brother-in-law was an officer in the Army and my brothers were both ministers at that time, and so that one of my brothers was working for the Navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So I was the only one who became a conscientious objector and went to a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But the family were very supportive, again, they didn't agree with me, but that didn't affect their affection for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Was there -- did you have anybody or any people who did agree with you and could support you with their agreement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Well, of course, a lot of the Quakers were passivists. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And on the <span class="REGION">land</span> , I was working on The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and this big <span class="DLF">farm</span> and there were quite a lot of other conscientious objectors all working on the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And so that, well, you weren't entirely alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">On the other hand, there were a lot of people who very vehemently disagreed with us and didn't -- didn't bother to hide their feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Indeed, when I got married, in those days accommodation was very difficult and you were appointed <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">That is to say, if you couldn't find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- and teachers had a priority. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And my wife was teaching in the <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> for little children, so she had a priority and she got a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But when we went there, the landlady said -- looked at me and said I understand you are a conscientious objector, and I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And she said, well, you're not going to live in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And so we had to go find somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But --
QUESTION:  So you did get a lot of hostility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Not a lot, but enough to make you realize that you were in an awkward <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And it was a difficult —
QUESTION:  Excuse me —
ANSWER:  It was an awkward situation, after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was what everybody felt was a very just war. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I felt the cause was just, I just didn't believe that war would ever answer it. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And so that you are living in -- <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was in a pretty rough position from the beginning, the first few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We had all sorts of, you know, military preparations for a possible invasion going on, so that kind of mindset. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But I just went out and worked and did my job on the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And in the meantime I had, as I said, registered with the Quakers that I was on their list of potential volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Now, this was a list of volunteers who would go overseas? </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and
ANSWER:  Yeah, anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">You see, I actually signed up during the Spanish Civil War, I would be a volunteer and I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , but the war ended before -- before I got an assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Um-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  And so then in 1944 they called me up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But somewhere along here you got married; is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was very important, 1942 I got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  So that was after you were working on the <span class="REGION">land</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  Yeah, after working on the <span class="REGION">land</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  It was wonderful, because they did everything -- their objective was not to make you into a highly-skilled technician or anything like that, but to make you into a person who could cope with things without the usual facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, I mean, they had the -- in the team there were social workers and people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But the training was more to teach you how to cope with new situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So they had a lot of, kind of, make-believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span> and they would -- one day they would decide that this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">refugee center</span> and that thousands of refugees were coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they had to be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So half the team would be the people looking after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the other half of the team would be the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And they were instructed to behave like people who are very desperate, who didn't trust anybody after their treatment in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so they wouldn't want to be registered, they wouldn't want to have their names taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And our job was to learn to try and cope with them and, yes, it was -- it sounds a bit odd, but it was really very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Another day they -- they said, well, we just had an air raid and there is no -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is being destroyed and so we have got to make do. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And so we were shoved out in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> there were just a few vegetables that have to be in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and we were told to find a way of keeping ourselves alive for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We were told to dig up the potatoes and make some soup out of boxes because there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so it was this idea of being on your own, having to do things that you had never done before, and not running away from the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And that certainly was very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">seg Might ea eden RSE REPS OER GE! </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Me TAAL MYSSH CSRS SHOP OHA SESH CRS UPN ALU abaHLarcess and

<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  So you started together from the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  Yeah, we started together as kind of a miscellaneous group, but then they gradually selected the people that were going to be on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And then we went on training as a team and we were supposed to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Before we do that, as part of the training was religion a big part or any part of the training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Quaker -- Quaker practices were part of the training. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We went -- in our team, I think there were only two Quakers, people who were -- people who were members of a Friends Meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The rest of us were Baptists, Congregationalists, Jews and -- but we did have -- we Started all our like team meetings, discussion groups, with a fairly long period of silence, which is, you know, the way the Quakers generally prepare themselves for -- in their religious service. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So we were very much aware that we represented the Quakers and that we would be expected to behave like -- carry out the principles of the Friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And this did -- this was an important factor because subsequently when we were working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under the -- while the war was on, and afterwards and the occupation, there were times when what the military authorities wanted us to do and what the Quakers would think would be the appropriate thing to do weren't quite the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And so we had to face up to that.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  Well, it was -- it was very interesting because, see, it was a very difficult situation in some ways because the Poles consider themselves -- considered themselves the first fighters in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They were the first <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> attacked by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And they, of course, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was very badly beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And the Germans were very bad to the Poles because they considered them kind of second-class citizens and brought them in for forced labor and so -- but when the war was over the Poles kind of felt, well, you know, they ought to be all considered heros because they were the ones who first started to fight the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And so they used to get -- and they wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but they couldn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because there was a problem inside <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as to who was going to govern the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So they lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we -- we looked after them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">We were the kind of town council -- like city government. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">One was looking after <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , one was looking after clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I was in charge of what was known as the camp commandant, and it was quite fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Well, fun isn't the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But it was very interesting.</span></p>

QUESTION:  And do you have some of those thoughts now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  No, except a sense of desolation when I see the way we seem to have -- still use war as a method of settling -- maybe that also has an argument in the fact that the third -- the Second World War didn't solve problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">There are just as many problems in Europe, people fighting each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So, obviously, there must be some other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But whatever the way was, it was too late to save all the people who were victims of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But that may be rationalizing it, but, no, I still think, I still believe that war is not -- never will be an answer to our problems.</span></p>
