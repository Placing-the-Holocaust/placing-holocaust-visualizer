<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">At that time, it was the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later became <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It’s <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  And what year were you born?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  1921? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And, what was your name when you were born, your full name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Officially, you know, in the documents, I was Carolina Sternberg, but I was always known as Lucie, L-u-c-i-e C-a-r-o-]-1-n-e, and that was never used except on documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And your name now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Lucie Carol Rosenberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Now, I want us to get some sense of what your life was like in your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So, perhaps you can start with your parents, or you can start where you would like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  My father’s name was Manfred Sternberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My mother’s name was Lili. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Her maiden name was Prister, P-r-i-s-t-e-r. He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slavonska Pozega</span> , which was a rural part of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , and my mother was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> and her family was an old Zagreb family that had originally come from what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and 1s the extreme <span class="DLF">border</span> that really is on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radiska</span> and Achilea (ph), and <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  And, your mother’s family was a fairly wealthy family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  They were a wealthy family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  And, what did her father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Her father was an architect and actually did all sorts of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> both for the — some private <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , but he did a lot of — for instance, he was building <span class="DLF">docks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fiume</span> at the time, and various — I think maybe some <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> of one kind or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I don’t think that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day architect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending money like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in one direction or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He was always working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  And what was your father doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  My father was an industrialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think mostly agricultural. </span><span class="sentence" id="32"><span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> obviously was a very agricult — mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol — and he had an <span class="BUILDING">alcohol yeast factory</span> which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , and a number of other <span class="BUILDING">agricultural refineries</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Since I’m ignorant, what does it mean to have an <span class="BUILDING">alcohol yeast factory</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">What is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because there were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Agricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for instance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And for a while, as a matter for fact, in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is what they’re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were huge, huge taxes otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or whatever, or the peasantry or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So, obviously there were lots of <span class="REGION">land</span> where some of this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  So, you were born into a very privileged life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  So, tell me about — like, let me first ask you, what is your clearest memory of your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">When you were little, when you were a young person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  A very sweet lady getting dressed to go out somewhere elegantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  So, they were very social?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  They were very social, but everybody was this way, young people, and it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">social town</span> , and it was a fairly small group, totally mixed — both Jewish and non-Jewish population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Now, were you taken care of primarily by governesses at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Yes, but my mother supervised. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">One of my very early memories was of a German nurse with a — who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They were special children’s nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I do remember that, and the cook saved — me upstairs, started screaming and the woman was let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother’s maybe five, this was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then I got an English governess, Miss... her name was... because the second one — the first one was called Miss “Mees Smees” — Miss Smith — she was known “Mees Smees”’,, who was with us for maybe six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My brother was throwing tantrums and — because he couldn’t stand her, and then the nanny came back for — and stayed forever as part of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six months, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was Agnes Coyne. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when King Alexander was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was a...
QUESTION:  That was in ’28?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  No, I think maybe °34, ’34. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to govern and one of the — I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King Alexander’s cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons — one was a Slovene and the other was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of like a governor of a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He had three children and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , but then they moved back to — then they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> , and they decided they absolutely had to have our governess, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted — she didn’t want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And my mother said, “You absolutely have to go because we would have sanctions against us left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">You can’t say no.” </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And finally she went, but apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day appeared at our <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big story about her being sick, having to move to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , nervous breakdown and so on, and she stayed until I guess I was 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Where did you eat dinner? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Did you eat with your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Did you eat -
ANSWER:  Lunch... The main meal was at noon, and the governess and my brother and I sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with them, and in the evening we sat with them when had dinner with the governess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  So, do you remember conversations around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Were they very inquisitive about what you had done during the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Or was this a very adult meal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Both?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Both, but yes, of course, because we often didn’t have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="73"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> were — school days were three days in the morning, three days in the afternoon from eight to one, quarter to one, something like that, and then afterwards we would have private classes of one kind or another at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in German, French, this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And, my brother may have gone — he did not go to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I did, but I’m a little — I’m already <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I'll go back, if you want, to, to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Three years younger, three years younger, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And so I’m not quite sure whether — I think I’m talking now mostly is-is already in <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Yeah, because, but otherwise, yeah, we ate at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">This was mostly for discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Well, you know, you sit around and slop around in sort of a <span class="INT_SPACE">children’s room</span> , it’s different than when you’re sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a meal that was served with white gloves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  So, there were people there who were serving with white gloves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  So, did that mean you have to be very prim and proper, as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Well, no, listen, because she took off her gloves and we palled around afterwards, but, yeah, it was quite formal. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was quite formal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Were your parent warm to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Were they affectionate?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Were you close with your brother even though he was...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I mean, as much as you’re close with a boy who’s three years younger than you. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You despise them mostly, but yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  And the friends that you had, were the many school chums that you had, or were...?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Lots of cousins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Not many, one cousin who is Mia Bauer (ph), who is two and a half younger — two and a half years younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">There was another one who died who was also three years younger, and then there were extended family — cousins who were about — but he was the oldest, except for two cousins who were from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and then later on — it wasn’t a very large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the Pristers all lived apart, so this was mostly Sternberg part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Although there was one cousin of the younger ones of the sisters that would have been — who was about my age, maybe a year younger or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Yes, they were very affectionate; yes they were strict as far as school work is concerned, as far as manners were concerned, as far as -
QUESTION:  Did you like <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  And, the private lessons that you had at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , what were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  French, later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Sometimes if I wasn’t doing too well in any subjects, somebody would come and we would work on the Latin and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Then I would go out for <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> of one kind or another, tap dancing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Tap dancing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Tap dancing at the time of Shirley Temple, I guess, it was the rage. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But that was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I mean, that wasn’t at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Did you ever tap dance at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> once you got back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Mildly, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Yes, I was not particularly good at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Go ahead, I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Also, there were gym classes of other kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now, this is kind of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My brother went to the <span class="BUILDING">Maccabi</span> , as most Jewish kids did, but I went first to the <span class="BUILDING">Sokol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The <span class="BUILDING">Sokol</span> is a pan-Slavistic — pan-Slavic gym organization and also, I guess, pan-national, pan-Slavistic nationalistic organization, that had a lot of calisthenic-type things, and I went to that which took place — I can’t remember — in some — there was a thing, yes, they had a particular <span class="BUILDING">hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was called a Sokolan (ph), and there were dances there as a matter of fact and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And, somewhere in the early 30s, maybe ’32 and so on, they had — there were things like the Olympics but only Slavic. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, they would come and, I mean, I never traveled out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> for it, but I remember there was a very large gathering and people came from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and who knows what, and there was this march and we did calisthenics and we did, you know, like the Germans did and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There’s these horrendous things in <span class="BUILDING">stadiums</span> and in fact there was a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> built at the time for this particular get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then later when I was about 12, again, my brother and others in the family were in the <span class="BUILDING">Maccabi</span> , I was a member of the HASK, which was the Crotian academic sports club, Hrvatski akademski sportski klub, which still exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was a big soccer club and <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> , and I did — what was it? — </span><span class="sentence" id="128">track, I ran marathons and that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was short marathons, and trained with it, and stuff like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  So, was your family very Jewish identified in terms of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , or was this in terms of social groups more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  My — they were obviously members of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">In fact, my mother had a plaque on, you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and so on, and they went for, I guess, Yom Kippur and the major holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We were required to go, both in <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> and so on, on Saturday to children services in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And it counted — you had to have an excuse from the rabbi if you didn’t attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  So, this 1s nationally required.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  This was nationally required as the Serbs and as the — the Serb Orthodox — and the Catholic kids had to go to services. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">This was not all the time, but there was maybe a period of three, four years where this was really seriously required. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we had religious classes both in <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> and obviously in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> where I went — I went to four years to the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , where we learned both biblical Hebrew and then later on modern Hebrew, and sang various things and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So, it was quite interesting as far as that’s concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And, once — and then, during that, as I said, during the major holidays, the parents went and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which was just around the corner from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Are you very politically conscious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Yes, and I was fairly Croatian — well, first I was very Yugoslav. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And then I become quite Croatian because they — mostly because, probably because the pressure from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> was really quite bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You felt it and everyday life. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In fact, if you look at a certificate, school certificate from a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , 1t was supposed to be in the two languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin script. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It went that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I guess you just become — many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were mostly nice and decent and I don’t think — they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly not overtly so. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I don’t know, maybe some were. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Some were, on the contrary, very less so. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very — had friends of all kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul’s regime and the various Serbian — especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression, and one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He was in the same <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> as Mose Piyade, and he was killed in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There was a whole group of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had no idea what it really meant, and who sat in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They were in very, very notorious <span class="BUILDING">political prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">One of them is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lepoglava</span> where they continued giving, you know, that was also later on in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> during the Ustashe regime and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So, there was a lot of that going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I’m trying to think, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  If I can ask you a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  How would you characterize being very Yugoslavian Nationalist versus when you talk about becoming Croatian? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">How does one distinguish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Well...
QUESTION:  How would you distinguish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  For me, I think this happened when I was maybe I was eleven. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I guess you suddenly became aware of that this was a repressive regime and that people’s friends were being — were being oppressed and also the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of the leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the government, was in the opposition, and you lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> and not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">You have — a lot of taxes and — not a lot, most, almost everything went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So, there it was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Money that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> , and public works that were necessary in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> never took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They were done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They weren’t even done in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They were stalled along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And, later on, there was a political —I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which 1s convenio, but actually they — the Croatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was repressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor Macek. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you’d drive out in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , you know, the peasants would yell, “Zivio Doktor Macek!” </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You also yelled, “Zivio Doktor Macek!’, </span><span class="sentence" id="288">and so on - May he live long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  And what does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Doctor — “May he live long,” I mean, “Hail,” or whatever you want to Doctor Macek. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And this — the Croatian consciousness, which had been really very, very repressed — and maybe that was one reason why all those Ustashes were successful later on because, you know, of course, they via a Bulgarian assassin killed Alexander, and after that, there was a very repressive regime in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> which repressed <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> most of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">More than any of the other...<span class="NPIP">provinces</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Much more, much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  And did you feel that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  I didn’t feel it, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I did not feel it, but I mean, it was talked about a lot in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Like, for instance, “God forbid, <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> is not the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> stop at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sava River</span> .”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, that kind of stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  So, who was <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , from that point of view, if not the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Just <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  It was <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And actually, geographically, it does stop there, and that’s how far the Turks went. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I mean, this is where they were stopped before going, getting into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  At the same time, Alexander’s assassinated in 1934.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, completely conscious because I remember — I remember walking through a <span class="DLF">street</span> , I must have been reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Obviously, I was reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">There was a — I'll regress a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Somewhere in 1933 or ’?</span><span class="sentence" id="315">34, my parents went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> — whenever the World’s Fair was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It may have been in ’34. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Somewhere there. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Okay, I think it may have been ’33 or ’34. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">When I tell you the next date, you will remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> on vacation with Agnes Coyne, Pippsi, and a friend of my mother’s, and this was right on the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> , and this was the year when Dolfuss was assassinated in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">He was the chancellor at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">My parents got very scared, and phoned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> and somebody came to see, to remove us from the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and that’s when things started becoming — became obvious that things were going to be happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And, I remember the election when Hitler was elected as chancellor because there was a demonstration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and I remember seeing a — there was a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I don’t think the paper was edited there, but there was a <span class="DLF">shop window</span> where the headlines were posted, the front page of one of the papers was posted, and I remember seeing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Then you started talking about anti- Semitism and so on, and that’s what I, how I remember this.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  About that, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  Do you and your friends talk about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we had, very soon after that, refugees coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Not under horrendous duress, but wanting to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and we had very intimate friends there, which was a mixed marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The husband was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The mother was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They wanted to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They came, they stayed with us, and they finally left for <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">One of the men who were working in my father’s <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Actually, he was in charge of livestock. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He was half German and half Argentine, and as you know, they had a big cattle industry in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , and he was there for years on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The <span class="DLF">farm</span> was part of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , as I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">This was all — molasses were there and the cows were eating part of it, and so, this man, who had both German and Argentine citizenship, managed to get these friends, whose name was Polla (sp), visas to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , and they stayed with us in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And more and more Austrian Jews were coming, sitting in <span class="BUILDING">coffeehouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">That’s when there started to be some unpleasant remarks were made, “Do we need these German speaking foreigners sitting here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then it became, “German speaking Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And obviously they were staying either in <span class="BUILDING">rooming houses</span> or <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> or with friends, but they were — everybody was —it was a coffeehouse society. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I mean, my mother went to <span class="BUILDING">coffeehouse</span> , my father — not the same one mind you. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The men played cards in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and the women had their bridge game someplace else or just went for coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So, 1t was a coffeehouse society like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You know, here they are talking German. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">At that point, nobody, none of the Croatian Jews spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We were — except to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I mean, it was, “Please don’t speak German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And we didn’t.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Absolutely, from that time on, and it was getting more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There was talk of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">killing camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">There were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political camps</span> and so on, and we knew of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We knew that things were starting to happen, and at that point, obviously, we were — oh, and then for instance, we had a subscription to Neue Freie Presse, which then we didn’t want to have anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Then, instead of the German papers, the Austrian papers, my father got Swiss papers, and everybody was listening to the radio to see what was happening, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">That was very — that felt threatening already.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Was it true for non-Jews as well as Jews the decision not to speak German, or was it mainly the Jewish population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  I think mainly the Jewish population, yeah, because the upper-middle class, non-Jewish, probably continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">These were remnants of old Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy, aristocracy and so on, and they spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And there were certain parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> where German was spoken almost as an everyday language. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It never was with me, but for instance, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Osijek</span> , my great-grandmother, spoke Croatian, and very well and correctly, but she was more comfortable in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But that was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Osijek</span> where there was a great — by the way, that was a very large Volksdeutsche population around there that had come in — Slavians that had come in, I don’t know, in the 17" century, 18" century, a whole batch of them who then became quislings of the worst sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But, I mean, there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> of nothing but German-speaking people in, mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slavonia</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  My father was always very anglophile and I wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I didn’t want to be in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, and later on my brother came. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">He went also to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">That was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  It had nothing to do with your father worrying that maybe he should get you out, at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">No, because I kept coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  You were there already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  I was there already, and they picked me up and we went back because my father — they hadn’t prepared anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">My brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> quite normally. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And then we stayed until things sort of blew over, and I went back with my brother, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I may have the — I may have the dates off a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, in the <span class="REGION">colonies</span> and for God’s sakes in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , where the climate was so horrible and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> were so cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And that kind of stuff, and “Who’s going to bring up my child?” </span><span class="sentence" id="613">By that time in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , people were having a lot of household help, let’s put it that way, and also, on top of it, his parents were divorced, which was another horrible fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And, yeah, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But, my father liked him very much from the word — well, my father was much more anglophile, although my mother spoke absolutely perfect English; my father did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Do you think that she liked him, but was worried about what he was going to bring you to, or do you think she really didn’t like him somehow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I’m trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He was a different culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He was... No, no, for instance, it bothered her — boys in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> were, you know, very much coat and tie and so on, and he was a rowing blue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  He was a what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  He was a rowing blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">He was the one who did the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> /Cambridge rowing team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So, he was wearing sweaters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  He was wearing, yes, sports clothes, which were very, let’s say, informal. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">It was different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  And, that was attractive to you, wasn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  I think so, yes, yes, that and being — not being obvious as I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">He talks among other people who didn’t care who I was, that anonymity was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Then I came back and the anonymity was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  It was gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  It was gone because I remember — oh, he did have — he was wearing a pair of white slacks and a white blazer, which is what these people wore, and I was walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And somebody saw him, of my older friends, actually a very well-known historian, a woman by the name of Fici Despot (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="634">She was one who ended up by being a Croatian leading historian, and she saw us on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and somebody asked her, “Did you see Lucie with the guy, with the Englishman?” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And she said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And she said, “What did he look like?” </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And she said, “Like the ice cream man.” </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So, you know, it was like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Was he shocked when he came and saw how your-?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  No, he came from a very wealthy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Although the family was divorced and his mother lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lake district</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  So, he was perfectly comfortable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  Oh yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  So, you had a big social life during that summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Yes, because two days after we were there, or maybe three days after we arrived, four other people that we knew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> arrived — two young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Two were journalists, and two were people that I just knew who had just graduated, who were — but not friends of Joe’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They met there. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He was very jealous, as a matter of fact, but I had made these arrangements previously, and they came and they were going to go do a tour of the Balkans or Europe or whatever afterwards, and they stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And then there was the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in September, and all of them immediately went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">British Consulate</span> and immediately — immediately reported, and the other four took off right away, almost immediately, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and Joe stayed maybe another week and went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">That’s the last time I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> a week later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  Did you try to convince him not to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  Oh, no, no, I would have gone myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We were all very gung-ho to go fight Hitler one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  That must have been very sad time for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">It was on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and of course at that time to embrace a man you weren’t married to or whatever, kiss him on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , my parents averted their heads and went off, and it was so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Maybe I was here and they were 100 meters away. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Underneath there’s way, there’s a whole new... I think my mother was relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  You think she was relieved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  She was relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">She was very fond of this person who, whose photograph I had, who was more to her liking and also, you know...
QUESTION:  But this was not typical to have people who were not married kissing and certainly kissing in public.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So, what happens then? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">You’re — you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , you’re obviously not going back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  I can’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I can’t go back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So, then I start taking — my brother, let’s put it that way, had lost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">In order to get back to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , he had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> to make up subjects such as National History, Croatian Language, Yugoslav Geography, which was a separate subject and so on, and he went to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> which was horrendously terrible for him because only retarded kids went to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> , but he went for a whole year before he could make up and then go to a regular <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">That was really traumatic because — yeah, I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I did odds and ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I took classes in History of Art. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">There was some sort of free <span class="BUILDING">university</span> which was for people who did not — who were not inscribed, that you could go to classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The British Council was running English classes and I sat in on them for laughs, really, because a friend of mine had gone there and did a course in proficiency in English which oddly, somewhere in ’47, I got the results of the exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Could you believe it? </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Somebody found them at the British Council after the war through a relative of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I learned typing, so I would know something worthwhile and practical for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">In fact, I brought an Olivetti with me on the trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I went to these ridiculous balls that were — You were launched in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> when you went to a certain dance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  And launched, is it -?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  As a debutante. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Until you were 18, you were a snotty-nose that nobody even considered as a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">You were a school child, a school girl, and so on, but after the Matura, after you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which I did not there, but I got to be 18 years old, you went to these various balls, and the ball was the, oddly enough, the journalist ball, and once you were at the journalist ball, I guess you were ready to get married maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Anyhow, then you were in society. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Then you can — I mean, then you were no longer led by the hand, although supervised seriously, but you were launched.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  For me, it was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was, you know, first of all, wearing ridiculous clothes that I hated with high heels, which I still hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">You had to have these dresses made on the whole, because there was no ready-to-wear, which was standing in front of dressmakers’ mirrors being prodded hither and yon by mothers, by dressmakers, by couturiers, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">It was hard, but you went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Did your mother like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">That was the duty, this was duty, but my mother — I was, and I still am, horribly nearsighted. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">To wear glasses, my God, I mean, you know — it was torn off of my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So, a number of people as I walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I didn’t curtsey properly, it was reported to my mother, and I didn’t see the poor person who was reporting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Pictures, photographs were taken of no glasses on, God forbid. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It was boring. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I had to stand straight, and I slouch on the whole; I always did. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And it was boring. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It was horribly boring.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  Can you talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">One of the things that’s going on is you’re listening to Radio Paris. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Paris Radio had a Yugoslav by the name of — I can’t remember, but I do have his name written down — he was — oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">He had one of these programs, like Voice of America had later on, where he was broadcasting to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and railing against the Germans, and then when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell, he went on — not to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> — he ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but he followed the French government where he could — where he was broadcasting, and he ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I ended up doing translations for the censors here for him, and when he was sick doing his broadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government, which was very funny, you were listening to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You were listening again on the radio to neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">What’s going to happen now that Hitler’s about to get us all? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But, you didn’t know where and how. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">This was — these were family councils going on among the members of the families — <span class="INT_SPACE">dining rooms</span> or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">It was constant. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And people who had lived in the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> , like the parents of these cousins that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> to be handy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">The major problem was that there were currency restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">You couldn’t send any money out. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The other problem was that my father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have gotten permission from the army to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They were sending mobilizations going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">There wasn’t mobilizing, but there was a — there was a state of alert, let’s say. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">My father —not my father, anybody, this wasn’t anything exclusive — had to do every — I don’t remember when you, probably, at various intervals, but at that time, I think, every two years, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He was a reserve officer in the Yugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six months or whatever to re- I don’t know — to get them up, you know, to whatever was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father — this was probably in 1940 — was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> for three months doing his military duty, and I had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So, I came to stay with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> , and that was very exciting, very nice first of all, nobody was supervising me. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I was living in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and I would see him in the evening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">One of the officers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I remember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">The Imam saying to my father, “Don’t you worry about anything, Fredo. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">If they come, I will say you’re Muslim. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The main thing has been done already.” </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So, you know, this 1s — this is what — I think that’s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  Can you explain that because the people who are watching aren’t going to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Muslims and Jews are of circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">That’s what it was.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  No, he was first in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> getting trained, and then he was in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> for quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He was camped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peshawar</span> , <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">That was the summer.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Yes, very exotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">In <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Delhi</span> and then, you know, when the heat got horrendous they went to <span class="REGION">Northwest province</span> , which was <span class="REGION">Kashmir</span> , I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  So, you’re not dating anyone else, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="772">At this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Not, dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I’m going out, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I’m going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Everybody knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Everybody knows, but I do go to the darned balls and to <span class="BUILDING">coffeehouses</span> and so on, but you know, mildly so.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  Do you talk together about — is he telling you now that he’s trying to figure out a way to get you all out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  Not at that particular moment, but yes, we talked, because this group was trained to withstand the Italian army, because, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Okay, so, obviously, I mean, we know what they’re getting to, you know, to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">We did talk about it, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Then, as I’m walking along in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> looking at <span class="DLF">shop windows</span> or whatever, maybe <span class="BUILDING">palaces</span> , maybe <span class="BUILDING">Diocletian’s Palace</span> , something more cultural, my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class turns up on their high school graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I have all of these dressy clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I was dressing 1n the evening in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where they were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So, I packed all of that up, and I left 1t with my father who then sent it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this third- class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that my class was riding in to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dubrovnik</span> , and I made a little suitcase of some kind or other, and this was like five o’clock in the morning, five-thirty in the morning, and suddenly there’s this knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I said, “Who 1s it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="787">in Croatian, and the man says, “The army.” </span><span class="sentence" id="788">He was some kind of guy who was in — who my father had sent to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So, this was the army that was getting me out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and left me there, and I joined this whole group, and then we finally got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> on some horrible third-class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , as I was saying how they were doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dubrovnik</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and that’s what we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  So, now do you think your father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> in 1940?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  Yes, he got a serious amount of money, but oddly enough, he had taken a loan on my mother’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was very valuable, not so much as, you know, a <span class="BUILDING">historical house</span> , but it was in the center of the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the <span class="REGION">land</span> was very valuable, and he got a loan from the — he took a mortgage, that’s what it is, a mortgage from the <span class="BUILDING">Zagreb Bank</span> , the city bank, and was getting ready to send up money somehow underground to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> or whatever, probably to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but my mother said, “Listen, the president — I saw the president of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and he really didn’t greet me with as much’, I hate to say deference, but that was the meaning, “as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Would you return that loan?” </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Which he did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  His old one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  His old one. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">It wasn’t all that old, but it was certainly not for <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and he — this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Buick</span> was very significant, by the way, and he — so, you know, it was a friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">It was a — for maybe a year and a half, two years, they were — they went -
QUESTION:  It wasn’t something very recent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  No, no, no, it was a long-term thing that was going on at that time, and he — yes, okay, we had that, but before that I was thinking we might be going, and that we didn’t get the visa, but they talked about the visa probably a month before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , there were five or six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span> , you know, like — steamers, huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trucks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zagreb</span> , yeah, that was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">When he sold the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> pro forma, he took — an uncle of my mother’s stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janusevac</span> , and was going to be running the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">They didn’t do him in, but he stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So, his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was there, but our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and stuff like that, that was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , taken by the Germans, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And we were putting into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trunks</span> embroidered bed linen and tablecloths and stuff of that kind, could you imagine why we needed that, and clothing, four-station clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">This was — I mean, four-season, four-season clothing, all sorts of junk like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And then there were suitcases around, and this was all open standing, being filled, so that when the Germans came, they had all packed together, they just took it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">It’s amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  So, what did you all think? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">That this would be shipped out somehow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  Yes, this would be shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I mean, this is how this was going on with people who left three weeks earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">There were people who left earlier.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Because of this tri-part agreement with, with German.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Excuse me, was there any doubt that your father would get permission?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  If they had felt that they wanted to be unpleasant, maybe he would have bribed somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I don’t know, but if they had wanted to be unpleasant, if he hadn’t had — he probably had some other paper there that he showed them, that he was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> to do something with — I can’t imagine it any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">He must have been, because it was very recently, he had just very recently done this, you know, training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> not so long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And, you know, he probably would’ve survived because all the prisoners of war survived, almost all, and just as aside, a friend of ours who was a Serbian officer, by the way, who’s father was a general, his wife’s father was general, and so on, was a prisoner of war in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he told me that the Jewish prisoners of war and the Serbs and everybody were together and that one time, the Germans wanted to separate the Jewish prisoners of war from the others, and these people went on strike and called the Red Cross and who knows what, and they left them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And almost all of them survived.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1380">QUESTION:  And, when did you get the job with Voice of America?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">ANSWER:  That was a fairly interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">There was no Voice of America when I joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">It was something that was sort of a precursor of OSS, and there was something called, I believe, the analysis section, and I looked at the papers, and I think it was ’43 maybe, and I was doing some research in — language research — at the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and then there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Balkan desk</span> where, again, I wasn’t doing much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I was doing translations and nothing much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">Then, this guy that I told you that was doing the broadcasting from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> originally, was doing broadcasting in — it wasn’t even Voice of America, I think it was still part of Coordinated Information, if I’m not mistaken, 1s what it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">But they had broadcasting facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">So, from the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Voice of America was, he was broadcasting there, and I was translating it into English for the censors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">Then, the man got sick, and I was the one who was broadcasting, and I had to end the — I said who I was because they knew who he was and so on, and I said I was broadcasting in his name, and it ended up, “May God save King Peter forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">May God save forever King Peter of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">This was for about six weeks or so, I believe, I was doing it, and then finally something like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Balkan desk</span> was established which was under — the chief was an Albanian, of all things, then there was some Greeks who had been — they were been shuttled back and forth, and I don’t think that we actually broadcast as Voice of America in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serbo-Croatian</span> until ’44 probably, and so that’s that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1391">QUESTION:  So, are you doing this work at the same time that Mario went into the army?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1393">QUESTION:  And, how did you — when did you and your parents hear about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">Was it soon after the ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1395">ANSWER:  Very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">My mother was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone, and a Western Union person came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">QUESTION:  Western Union?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1398">ANSWER:  Western Union came with a telegram, and I remember I was at the hairdresser after work, and I called to say, “I’m coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">I’m sorry, do you need anything along the way?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">Then we were living on 102™ and <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> , and she said, “This man just handed this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">So, my father was in the mustard business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and — which was quite a strange thing, and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">It was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">It was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">I can’t tell you how horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">On the other hand, it was happening all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">There were several families, friends of ours, who had lost, in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">So, it was in the middle of this whole dreadful trauma for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">We weren’t the one that was picked out as the only one to live through, you know, badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">The training that they had, I don’t even know how long the basic training was, and he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> for a while, and he wrote a letter that made us know where he was, and he’s buried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Laurent</span> , you know, that big <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1410">QUESTION:  Have you gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1411">ANSWER:  Oh, several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">I went, the first time I went there, it was still only wooden markers, no Mogen David there, and then there was one British person who was an administrator, and then of course, it went on to became this super, huge, enormous <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which has lost some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I mean, in a way that more moving and impressive, and in another way, it’s less, because this was, so to speak, raw earth, just lines and lines of wooden crosses, and with names on them, that’s all there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">And then we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in the ’60s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">So, we went several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">This was a decision my parents made, especially my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">He said, “You know this will be a <span class="DLF">grave</span> that will be taking care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">It will not depend on whether you’re paying some kind of duty, or somebody should be there to watch this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And I think it was a very good decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1420">QUESTION:  Rather than bringing him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1421">ANSWER:  Yes, because friends of ours did, and that was better for them, and I also have a feeling maybe my father wanted to save my mother more trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I think my mother was closer to my brother, then — not closer to him than to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">In a way, I think, she was closer because we were women, but this was the carrier of the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">So, that counted, and it was an extremely macho society, <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , not only, I mean, for everybody, for all people, for all Jews and for everyone, Serbians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1425">QUESTION:  So, in some ways he was more important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1426">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I think maybe I was closer to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">All together, he was, and it’s crazy to say “mama’s boy’, because that’s not, you know, in that sense, but I think he was more — I think he was independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">I don’t know, maybe because I was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">Maybe, because he was better looking than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">He was very good looking person, and I was, for a while there, a very thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">He was a good looking young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">So, I think — for a child, and they fed him well, and he got round, and I was always scrawny at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">So, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I think that may have been part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where women walked behind the donkey while their husbands rode. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">I won’t say in our society, but underlying that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">It carries over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1440">QUESTION:  Did it affect your father the way it did your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1441">ANSWER:  I think it affected my — my father was a soldier through four years or more, and he knew of the horrible possibility existed, and I mean, he didn’t sit in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> during World War I. He was in the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> among going on, this, that and the other came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And, horrible as it is, I think in a way it may have been an interesting experience for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">He told a story which has nothing to do with this, but I just want to mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">When he got — I guess this must have been on the Russian/<span class="DLF">Polish border</span> somewhere, he said that a man came to him who was in the Russian army and surrendered, and said that I’m Jew soldier (ph), and so he -my father took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pozega</span> along with his horse, and the man stayed I don’t know how long with the family as a prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">So, he was in a nice regiment, hunter’s regiment with nice uniforms, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Although, he was in <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , and he knew how horrible — I think it’s a different experience to them than to <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> .</span></p>
