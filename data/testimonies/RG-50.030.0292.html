id="420">As soon they took us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they — they started in — they started taking brigades, they were called brigades. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">When a brigadier creates — they instituted a —a police, a Jewish police was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and then they instituted also the — a Jewish council. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So, first of all they were — had to repair to fix the <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So everybody was compelled to go out in the morning, five o’clock in the morning had to be in the <span class="BUILDING">reunion place</span> , and then they used to come and — with guards, and — and walk to the — to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So I remember they used to give us 200 grams of bread, and I used to put it in the pocket, an-and by the time I came to the — to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and when they used to give us some soup, which was made of water, and well, with some — some vegetables, some kind of this [indecipherable] vegetables, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And they used to boil that, and by that time I didn’t have really bread, because walking, I September 22, 1994 —I used to chew off on the portion of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So the situation of — the food situation became very — the — the — the duration was very, very bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And we — we had to trade sometimes, certain objects with the — with Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So, in the beginning, they used to let the — we were able to do that, but there were some — some people who didn’t have a heart, from the <span class="REGION">Lithuanian side</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">For instance, used to trade a— a-—a suit for a— for a kilo

</span><span class="sentence" id="431">So, in the desperation you found out sometimes that instead of butter, what you had is a big stone, on that — I mean, with — with a— with a little bit — with a

QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We need —
ANSWER:  — very much — the move — the move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was very organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Was very organized in the sense that you would hardly see fights between people that, no I want this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I want that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">There were certain — that was certain way organized that you were able — of course, you had to get yourself a — somebody — a horseman with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and — and be able to — to carry over, and couple pieces of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and mostly the — the — your personal belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But it was in a certain way — it was in certain way organized, because by — by the people themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">You know, it’s not — we di — we didn’t have — we had a certain leadership which was already instituted, but it was not a — a — a full time leadership, it was just — they came with the least, and they told you look, you have to go here, here, here, and you have to do this and this and it, and wa — you know, the people were very much organized, and very much respectful, you know, we’re — we’re not — we were not strict people, you know, it was mostly people who were — who had a certain background, and you hardly were able to find somebody that was not educated, that was not able to read or write. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">This was — you take from the Lithuanians, you hadSeptember 22, 1994 like 50 percent for the people were illiterate, you know, especially those who lived on the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , they — they — they didn’t know how to read or write. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They used to put a cross for — when they had to sign something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And this was the sad part, you know, because people who are not literate, and who drink a lot and who don’t have any — any — any — any feeling towards — towards [indecipherable] humans, they — they become — they become very — they become like animals, you know, and — and this is what — what happened there, and I really regret to say that, that there were, of course cases whereby they harbored Jews, they helped to escape, and there’s — but that was sporadic, I mean, that was like a one percent, or something, that — that have — were human. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And this was also most people who were a little bit better educated, and who actually knew the facts, and — and who — who were able to — to analyze, and — and — and realize that saving somebody in these critical times, although they expose their lives, because any — anybody that saved a Jew was like — oh, it — would be — would be shot the same way, like the — those people that they saved.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  — nobody went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and —September 22, 1994
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">There were no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But amazingly — amazingly that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were like 30 some thousand people, were pushed into this couple square kilometers in very inhuman conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But th-the — the ghetto life right away — I mean, we right away organized ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We had like — we had a — a — a el-elder’s [indecipherable] which was a council, with a head of the council, which was a prominent — a prominent doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">For many years, a Lithuanian — he was a M.D., and he — he was considered one of the top doctors in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , Dr. Elkes. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And he was very strict, very — in the beginning he didn’t want to take the job, but the — the other people from the — I mean, the head people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> came to him, and they pleaded with him that he should — he should there — they need him, because first of all, his perfect German, and his perfect Lithuanian, and perfect Russian, and he was already educated, very cultured person. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And beside that, the respect that even those — the — the — the — the — the — the captors had for — for him, in a certain way, his known — his name was very, very prominent. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So they felt with this respect him — the Germans expressed very big respect for him, although they compelled this council to do their dirty work in — in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But many of those who belonged to the council, and then the council instituted a ghetto police. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And we had like over a hundred police officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Their whole uniform was only a — a hat, and a armband what say, Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Plus the fact they had to use also the — the stars, the sameSeptember 22, 1994 like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But these police was very instrumental in — in many cases, 1n many — after we were already established in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we had a — most of the people had already a regular — I mean, some regular job, work, you know, the job was because — nobody paid for the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They hardly gave you sufficient food to — for your sustenance, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But when — when — for instance, myself, I worked in the beginning in the <span class="DLF">flugplatz</span> , that’s an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And not only worked, I put in extra time, I was —
QUESTION:  Speaking of <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">It’s especially — you know, it’s strange, you know, you — you — when you go back to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which looked when you were very — when you were small, I mean, it looked to you that it’s a fantastic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because you didn’t know better, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">When you go back and you see, and — and — and you walk this same distance that you used to walk on the <span class="DLF">garden</span> before, it seems to you so small, and so insignificant, you know, it’s a— it’s pathetic, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So I remember we used to walk on — under guard, with loaded rifles like — like supercriminals and all the — although there were no cases — very few cases of resistance within the — within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , within the — the — the establishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And you — you call — you do your work, and you come back after a day’s work, whereby you have guards there, and they constantly changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">In the beginning they had the 46September 22, 1994 German guards, but then they start to bringing in the — the [indecipherable] the Russian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And believe me, these guards, they were incompassionate. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They used to beat you up every time you — you — you had to — to work, I mean without — almost without food, but constantly, and under supervision, and within the cold weather, they — they used to put a— a some a—a side fire in our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">From time to time you would come and — and warm up your hands, you know, you had the mittens, or the — but that do — didn’t mean anything now, because if your body doesn’t have fuel, I mean, you — you are — you still cold — it gets colder than in normal, when you have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And they used to have special — special <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> — wood sticks, which they would beat you up, you know, ev-every time, and without — without mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And every time you used to go to warm up, you stayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was prohibited to do that in the beginning, but you would do it — come out, because when the — and so my uncle was — he was a sick man, you know, he — so I used to work for him, I — sh — because there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day, around the clock, to work at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , because they want to re-re-reestablish the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and — in order to be able to use that for their — for their own — for their own use, for their — and life was — was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Of course, it — it gradually was in — in changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In the beginning it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Then after — after a while it became aSeptember 22, 1994 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and we have received the — before we were under the Wehrmacht, under the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Then we — we came under the jurisdiction of the Obersturmfiihrer Gecker(ph), and that was the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It’s funny now this calls the — the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So the SS, they were — they were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They — they were still much worse than the Wehrmacht, because the Wehrmacht you found sometimes between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you know, they’re — they were — they were called to — to duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But there were still certain aspects of — of humanity, at one point, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But this — this [indecipherable] came in, and then they declared that as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So we came — we became a— a-—a-—ina different status, whereby this was right after — after the big aktia(ph), which was October 20" — 28", 1941, is when they — when they came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span> and they announced that next morning, five o’clock in the morning, after we have in a — in a special — a special large <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that everybody has to be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Nobody can stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Not even the sick people can stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Everybody has to be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">If they find somebody <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , they will shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So, next morning, everybody came out, and the — took some food, and they — they said that you take — if you had some food, take with you, because you’re not going to be provided with any — any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So everybody came out, and suddenly a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> came in, and it was — with guards, and they — theySeptember 22, 1994 surrounded the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and then the — the head of the Gestapo that time was a guy by the name of Rauca. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Joseph, I think was his name, Rauca, and was a big German, a heavyset guy, and they came with dogs, and they started — they started — first of all, they searched <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , spot searched, whatever they can find somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And they as-assured themselves nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They start pulling people to the left and to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Well, right away we saw that the people that they pulled to the left are mostly children, elderly people, people who are — have some blemish, or have some — some — some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I remember I had a little coat, you know, was a — was a fur — you know, the — the collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So — and it was a cold — a cold [indecipherable] was October, it was already winter, basically in the — almost snow was — we were going to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">There were signs that snow was going to fall there. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So then, I had my — my grandmother was with me, and I knew that they are going to call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So, it was like instinctively, you know, when they pull her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to save her, you know, right, yeah, she was still with us for a couple more years afterward. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But then they — they took out all those people, and they took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And that was a whole day operation, and we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Of course, we understood that they are taking them to a certain special assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I would like also to mention that the — the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right — rightSeptember 22, 1994 after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed, we found out in the next few days, that those was the first 500 people that they took to the , and they shot them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Because their aim and their interest was to — to get rid of the — of — of more intelligent people, or people who are — who can plan, and who were — who had certain — certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to — to get rid of them right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And — and then there — there were — they were ina certain way right, and they were, in a certain way they have accomplished their — their — their doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Now this time — that was 500. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Now this time, on October 28", they took them also to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> , and they also shot them, and there were 10,000 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They — they had — they were more ready for these 10,000 than for the 500, because they already had excavated. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They had — they had a brigade that they took ahead of time, and they didn’t know what — that was a — a small aktion, which they took about a few dozen people. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And their — their job was to excavate in the vicinity of the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fort</span> was large, you know, those forts were established by the Russians, and they were specially kept for — for protection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> was surrounded by the <span class="BUILDING">Third Fort</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">There were like four forts. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And they were done by the — still by the — by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">They were at high — at high levels, and — and they were — had a — places for — for — for soldiers, and — and — and of course they had <span class="NPIP">places</span> forSeptember 22, 1994 inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So they — those were the 10,000 that were — they — they liquida — so they actually cut by one-third, right away, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">This was also in conjunction with the burning, and with the — of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">You see, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was instituted, they had the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they had the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">What was the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The difference was that one main <span class="DLF">thoroughfare</span> , one main <span class="DLF">road</span> , run through the — through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , between the small and the large. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And what they did is — what they — what they did is they instituted a — they built a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> from the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which was also surrounded with wires, and that was always under military supervision. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So the — the beginning, and this — in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that they converted, they have arranged for that, and they had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with very, very — we had quite a number of doctors, and had quite a number of — of — of patients, people who were ill, who were sick, who were — who were old, who needed — who needed care, and there were also some women who were pregnant, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was full to capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And one day what they decided is that — that they felt that — apparently that they don’t need a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and they don’t need no sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So what they did is they surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they surrounded that with haystack around. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They poured gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They nailed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and they burned — everybody was burned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, including the — includingSeptember 22, 1994 the — including the pregnant women, including the — there was such a terrible — I mean, the — the — you — you could smell the — the — the stench, you know, the — the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And right after that they had the — the big aktia(ph), and then they — they eliminated completely — this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was completely, those few people who still were there were evacuated, were passed to the — to the — to the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because it became more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> available by — by eliminating 10,000 people, it was too much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know, basically, based — based on they — on their standard. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But this was a terrible, terrible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the — this — this was — in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know, that’s — which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain — for — like for children, for — for — for — for babies, and then old people and so on.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I have to mention that also, that — can I go on? </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Also being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was very traumatic, but the chairmans from time to time, they called up Dr. Elkes and they said, we need hundred people for a special assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Nobody knew whether this assignment is for real or whether it is to take out and to shoot people, but there were some real assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So I remember the Arbeitsamt, which was the place where the — where the council was, and it was a special <span class="BUILDING">building</span> assigned — it was also a place that had also a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Because within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there were sometimes found some people who are — who stole and who did certain acts of — which was not permitted, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So I remember that when the police head in — in the Arbeitsamt, the — the council, they had a — a very difficult task, whom to take out? </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I mean, the chairmans told them we need hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I mean, there were also certain favoritism, which has to — I mean, happens from time to time, you know, because if you have a — if you are a police officer and you have a relat — a relative that they want him out, I mean, you would — you would try to protect him rather than somebody you don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So in many cases, it was a very, very difficult job for the — for the — for the elderat(ph), for the — for the council to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">What they opted to do is, most of the time, is people who didn’t have families, people who — who didn’t have — who were not rooted for, for some reason, whom they had someSeptember 22, 1994 grievances or some problems with them, problematic, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Because many people have just collapsed mentally under this pressure, you know, not everybody was able to be withstand that, you know, because it was — it was like the game of the cat and — and the mouse, you know, and it bites off one leg and then the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I mean, it was a constant game, you know, and especially when — when the — when the Gestapo used to appear and come into — to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I mean, it was very traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I have also to mention to you is about were — because it came to my mind about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rauca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I had a personal — after I finished at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , I got myself a good brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Mine was good because I worked in a — for some reason they — they formed a new one and I was at the right time at the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They formed a brigade in a <span class="BUILDING">marmalade factory</span> — and this was fantastic, you know — which had like — our brigadier was a guy by the name of Motts(ph), who survived incidentally the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> [indecipherable] later in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I was very friendly with — with him and I was able to stick to this brigade after — especially after the flugplatz, this was like a—a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Brigade was — we had to — that was a — a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of marmalade and right next to that was also a place where they used to produce sauerkraut and sour pickles — pickled — pickled, you know, cucumbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And at least you had — you were able to — to — to get some food, you know, because sauerkraut and pickles and marmalade, it's already a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And plus the fact marmalade is made with sugar andSeptember 22, 1994 sugar 1s very heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I remember they — they used to — I was compelled — I was pretty strong, you know, and I was compelled to — to take up bags of hundred kilo sugar — which is 225 pounds — to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , where the — where they had the mixing of the — of the marmalade. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And sometimes what I used to do is, I used to punch a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the bag and I had a — this — this coat that you see on this — on this picture, on this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">My grandmother had made, like a — a double — a double-deck, you know — a double — I mean, of the — the lower part. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And —

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But while we're on that, who was up there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  There was a — there was a military storage for the — for the German — for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And it was not precisely Gestapo, it was a military. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Gestapo is — I was — I was threatened by this Meyer(ph), when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">One day he caught me with — with this — with this marmalade, and he just waved his finger and says, next time, you're going to go to the Gestapo if I catch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">It was — it was something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So he was very generous at that time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He just kicked me and that’s all, and took away the —
QUESTION:  When you — when you went up to take the sugar to the stor — this <span class="BUILDING">military storage place</span> , did you hear people talking, did you see anything that was particularly interesting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Not — we were too busy in — 1n — 1n carrying again, and be able to carry the load. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">That was — that was — actually, my mi — our mind was blanked out at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">WeSeptember 22, 1994 — we were not able even to communicate because they — they used to — when — when it came to a — to a job like this, it's not like the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> where you had a shovel and a— and a pick and you have to dig and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">You know, this — this was — they had to be unloaded in a — 1n a certain time and they — and you had to — you had to rush. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And if you wouldn’t rush, they — they just clubbed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So at this — this moment, you were — you were just trying to — to keep up with your strength, in order to be able to fulfill the — ful-fulfill the — the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">There was also, in — in cases before I — I became — I start working — notwithstanding if we worked at this [indecipherable] brigade, from time to time, they take — took us to some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I have to tell you something which is — which was very much inscribed in my — in my memory, 1s that [indecipherable] in the — in 1941, beginning '42, they brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , echelons — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> loads with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , you know, of people from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and from some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And amazingly —

ANSWER:  So that —
QUESTION:  Actually, I need that you to start that whole —
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">There’s a very remarkable something that I have to bring it up because there are certain aspects of me being in the — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that — that I have toSeptember 22, 1994 highlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And one of them is that this incredible experience that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And namely, they start bringing, to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , echelons — boxcars with the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They called that, we found out later, the Hebrew siedlung. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Hebrew siedlung basically means, <span class="NPIP">place</span> from one — take them from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and put them to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> loaded with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , with all kinds of luxury items, to make believe to those people, when they — because you see, when they took out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , Jews to send them to — to their — to their massacre, to their — I mean, to their — to their <span class="DLF">graves</span> , to their killings, was — apparently, they had a certain — a certain — had to handle it in a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They tried to convince them that they are being taken to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , just only to — they have to take them to — to — to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So when they came — and at that time, I was working for the Gestapo brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many people have tried very hard to work in this brigade, because this brigade was always connected with certain — certain things that had to do with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And there was many possibilities to — to fill up your stomach, you know, to be — to — not to be hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And this time they needed additional — additional people. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So apparently, they took me and they took a — a group of other people to that task. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And I — and I saw the way this echelons came, and I saw that they came in — in like, in plush September 22, 1994 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It was not the — the — some — some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> came also at the same time, but they came for a — for — for a purpose of — of baggage and — and some other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came with — and the people with their jewelry, with everything, and —and you could see very high standard people who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I knew exactly what they are doing with — what they are going to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Before — this Rauca came over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were like, six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , six guys, and he said to us — he said, you see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">There is no way that you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">If I see your lips moving, I know that you are trying to tell them something or give — send them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And he just like, took his pistol and — and — and — and just scraped our — our — our faces, you know, with that, to — to — to impress upon us that he means business, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The difficulty was by knowing what — what’s going to happen to those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">How do we tell them — or whether — whether to tell them was the right thing, or not to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">It was so difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Now, our task was to take out from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , a German with — with loudspeaker would say to the — say to one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> — plush <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and say [speaks German]. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It means, give me your packs. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You have a few kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You have to go a few kilometers, please give out your packages because it’s going to be very burdensome and we are going — pla-placingSeptember 22, 1994 these packages in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we are going to deliver them. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And make sure to inscribe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return that to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I knew that that’s — that’s fallacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I mean, this 1s — where they are taking them is to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> and it’s — it’s about 10 or 12 miles walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">It’s not a couple of kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And that’s what’s going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And in one case, I saw a lady, which I — pretty young lady, and — and I really felt — with her husband, felt — a couple apparently — and I felt very bad and I — I tried to — to explain to them, to tell them that — of course, we were already involved in taking the packages, and — and I —I-—TI looked around, I didn’t see Rauca there, apparently he went to have something to drink or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And — and I said to them that, they are taking you to your death. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Try — when — when you — when — when you will march, try to — to escape or try to — to do something or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You know, the people didn’t believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They just didn’t trust me. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They trusted the Germans by that time, but they didn’t — they didn’t trust me. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They looked at me and looked at me, and they looked at me like I am — like I am trying to — and then I — I —I felt very bad about the fact — I mean, I— I —I—I felt scared that they should not — they should not give me — turn me over, or say that I tried to — to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">This — this was the — this was the fanatism. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Th-The German — the German Jews were very big fanatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They felt that they were first Germans and then Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">That was their big — their big problem.</span><span class="sentence" id="643">September 22, 1994 They were — they — they eliminated from their prayer books, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> — it would say, next year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">They used to put in, next year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Th-Th-This — this incident I remember so vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And I remember when we took the packages, and we took them directly to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And the Gestapo, they had a big — a big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where they just threw them in one big pile and then they used to have a — those people who worked at the Gestapo used to sort them out and <span class="NPIP">place</span> — for instance, place different items in — based on a list that they had, which items have to go here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">You know, they were very meticulous and very organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The Germans, they were extremely organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I mean, when it came to organization it was — I mean, they were leaders 1n the world on that, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> looked like a — like a little <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , comprised of individual <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">It looked like a— a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , surrounded with barbed wire [indecipherable] guards with high lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">It looked like a place of — a place of no return, I would put it this way, because nobody of those beginning 33,000 people — although everybody dreamed — was getting liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But in — in his deep mind, he knew that this is a — thi-this is a— a—a dream that’s never going to be fulfilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">It — 1t was as — as time went by, we — we found ourselves more secluded, more guarded, more — we — we found also when — when the front starts turning — turned around, and then like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , we f— we felt that there is a certain additional pressure on us, because 75September 22, 1994 the Germans, they felt already that they are not — they didn’t accomplish what they wanted accomplish in four months, because this winter was for the, like Stalin used to say, my best — the best general, is general winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Well, this is what devastated the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">It devastated them to a point, you know, the Germans, they — they were cut clean, shaved, nicely dressed, you know, nice with their uniform, with their — with their — this was a phase. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">But when they — when they were encountered by him, when they felt this terrible winter, you know, and where they didn’t have the supplies, because partisans, and especially in the beginning, mostly Russian partisans have cut off the supplies — all the <span class="DLF">supplies line</span> were just shattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And they were not able to get the supplies, where they had to have their lice, and they had to have their — their —their flea, and — and the — and th-the discomfort, and not have the food in their time, and — and the rifles were — I mean, the cold winter was so cold their rifles were stuck, you know, they were not able to — to shoot when they had to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And so they — they — they start — they had different thoughts, and the — and the punishment for those people that als — also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , who were in there guarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , was also to send them to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">The <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , the expression to send you to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> was like a sentence of death to a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">So they were — an-and when they were in this state of mind, that they saw that things have turned around, they also felt that they have to punish theirSeptember 22, 1994 what — wer — wer — what — how can they ex-express their — their frustration, their — their — their — their disappointment? </span><span class="sentence" id="825">They cannot say anything against their — against their — a-against their leadership, because they wouldn’t do that to — dare to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So what they did is they — they put the biggest squeeze on — on the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">They want to show their leadership that they are better equipped, they are better — they know better how to handle, how to — how to squeeze, and how to eliminate their — their prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Their — this would give them like a — like a pat on the shoulder, saying you’re doing a good job, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">My — my aunt’s brother, Chaim Levner(ph), he was a police officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Nice, awful nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">He used to live with us [indecipherable] and we used to live together. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So he was also one of those officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I mean, they — they asked for the whole police force to gather, and then when they gathered, the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that came out — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> were behind, the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came out, it’s like a— a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and came out three Germans, and this was — and I was watching through the <span class="DLF">window</span> what happened, I was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And they told to the police, they — to get in — into — in two <span class="DLF">lines</span> , one behind the other one, three <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And three rows [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And then they told them — they asked each of them they should mention their name. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And right afterward, they told them they should sit down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So everybody sat down, you know, in this, in this way, you know, crossing — crossing the leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">My uncle — my aunt’s brother, for some reason —September 22, 1994 I mean, apparently he had a feeling that something is wrong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He gets convulsions, and he was not able to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So the chairman just pulled out the gun and just shot him, right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And I was in — in — that was right in front of me, in the — in the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And then, he was carried away, and then they took all the police, and they put them in — in the — in the first — 1n the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , everybody, including the chief, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And right after that, they started the children’s aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Was to take out all the children that were still left, and — the children and the elderly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">We had in our — there, where we had the bread supply, we had a —a-—a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And we were able to bring down my — my cousin, and place her there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And this was the last time that we were — that we felt that she should remain in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because we felt that — and th-this day, they took away — they took away all the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">They went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they pulled out the children and elderly people, and they took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And of course, you know where they took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Now, when the people came from the <span class="BUILDING">brigades home</span> —
QUESTION:  I’m sorry — End of Tape FiveSeptember 22, 1994 Beginning Tape Six
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We were talking about the children being —
ANSWER:  Where — where — where — where in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">children’s aktion</span> , it was specially devised to get out all of the children from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And in order to implement that, they had also to take out all the police because this was also — there were also children from the police officers, and — and you know how a father would react seeing his child being dragged and beaten and taken to a — to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and then taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So after this — this happened — and this was very fast, you know, they — they had a big number of — of gendarmes, of SS people who — who implemented this function. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">They went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they — they knew exactly which <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">They had already a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Apparently, previously they have — they have asked for the — for the composition of the people who lived in the — in each — in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">You know, it was — so they — they had certain records, or somebody gave them the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And they indiscriminately — I mean, they have — they have walked into each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , pulled out — pulled out the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And most of the children were — especially the — the older ones were — their mothers were — were at work at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">There were only a number of mothers who, when they took the children, they didn’t want to go with their kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">They wouldn't let them — let them stay with the kids, so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then theySeptember 22, 1994 took away the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And the mothers were devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And especially now at — at six, seven o'clock, when the people start returning from — from work, and when they found out this news, it was such a outcry. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">It was such a tremendous outcry that — that ev — everybody was crying and everybody was — was — was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">It was something that some people throw themse — threw themself on the — on the barbed wire, you know, to — to — to see whether they just can just get out and — and — and — and do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And people — really, the mothers didn’t — didn’t care — care for their life anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They — they — they just wanted to join them, to be together with their — with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And the police officers — the way we — we found out later, they were — they were investigated, to find out whether there are some kids who were hidden, like we were — we hid the — my — my cousin, who was really about, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And besides that, they want also to know where — because they had information at that time — It was already ‘44 and they knew that there were many, many, many, many freedom fighters who — who st — his — have still a communication with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they had apparently — it was felt that — also that the police — certain police officer have helped some, and still helping some of the — of the — of the freedom fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">So they wanted to find out, and they shot quite a number of police officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">They shot this Greenberg(ph) who — who — who was very instrumental. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">They 86September 22, 1994 tortured him and shot him, and he would not divulge, and would not give out where the — where the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And then the rest of those police officers, they — part of them — they returned back — back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , became devastated and found also their — their children gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And the — it was really — the — the feeling, I mean, was — that was so bad, you know, that the — the whole situation created an incredible loss of — of hope, you know, when you saw something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And this was March and it — it was already when the Russians have advanced already, substantially towards — towards the west — towards — towards — they liberated already many, many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they were — they were moving towards — towards <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And that was an episode which is — which was very, very tragic, you know, very — even difficult to — to describe this. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">This is — sometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and — and we exchange — exchange views. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And the — the — the question is, between one survivor and the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I mean, this is — I mean, it’s — it’s — you see, you are limited in — in — in — in being able to understand it when — when somebody tells you something, you know, that’s — because their — our — our minds are — are in a certain way limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">We cannot understand beyond this limit, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And it is, how can somebody describe certain things that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="949">How can somebody describe that a German SS man takes a 87September 22, 1994 child of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes him with his head against — against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I mean, how can — I mean, this is — it — it’s — it’s not even — even in the most substandard <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , I mean, it’s happening, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">They — they kill people, they massacre people, but — but I don’t think it’s only — I mean, it’s — and it’s hard to describe and it’s hard to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Sometimes I myself, it’s hard for me to believe that — that — it looks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly happened, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">An-And — and time was going so slow, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">The — the — the — the worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of — I didn’t even mention some other work that I used to do, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">They took us to the — to the <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> in — sometimes and we had to clean out latrines and something else, you know, they — and some — sometimes they took some people and they just threw them into the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , I know, just only to — to have a little pastime for themselves, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So I mean, it’s — it’s — it’s beyond — beyond description. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So that’s — so that’s one of the reasons why we meet together with survivors sometimes, and we share experiences, we — we — we can understand it much better than — than — than explaining that to the <span class="REGION">outer world</span> , you know, it’s — it — and it’s very hard to believe that a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so advanced, you know, was — was get — getting children and then [indecipherable] and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">That were — that were able — that wer — came down to a level, to such a level, to — to — to be so destructive and soSeptember 22, 1994 without hearts, without — so the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was — th-this was a — at that — at that stage, it was already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot keep our — my uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daughter there. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">So we made contact through a — there was a rabbi’s wife, Shuman(ph) was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And I’m sure that she — she is going to surface in some of your — some of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">She was a — an incredible lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">She was a rabbi’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Her husband was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> — in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And she — some way he left before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And she was matchmaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">She was out — without the — without the — the stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">She was going around and finding <span class="NPIP">places</span> to harbor children. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So some — somebody told us about her and we were in — contacted her, and — and she found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for Sulami(ph), which was my — my — my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">She was three and a half, or four years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">My — my aunt laughs always, she says that I— I — I used to have an incredible appetite, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And I used to watch, you know — she used to give her — sometimes we were able to smuggle in tapioca. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">You know what is? </span><span class="sentence" id="974">It’s a— and I used to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it would be left over for me to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So she always — so we decided to do — how would — we would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">At that time, we had two SS people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">One name was Fiffiger(ph) and the other name was — what was the other name? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It will come to me pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Yeah, it’s [indecipherable] Fiffiger(ph) was a former teacherSeptember 22, 1994 and he was — very much befriended my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">He was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">He was a SS, and he told the story that he was forced into the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And he — he expressed very good sentiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So my uncle had to put his confidence — he showed in — in few cases, he showed that he was — he was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And we could see that he is not one of these — one of these beasts, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So my uncle explained to him and — and he knew that we are having the child there, and — against all odds, and he promised my uncle that he is going to help him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">This was a remarkable — but his comrade, his friend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">What he did once was also beyond — he encouraged people — he opened up the — he opened up th-this — anyway, first, let me finish with Fiffiger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="989">So they arranged that the — the — the bread was coming in twice a week with these big <span class="DLF">platforms</span> , and then the horses with a driver were going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So we arranged to — I gave her the sleeping pill. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">We put her in a bag because they — it used to come in bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">So we put her in one of the bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And we put her under a big — so they — she can go through the — through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Because the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , they always used to stick something to find where there’s sometimes hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But it was already prearranged, you know, that apparently he — he — he did that — Fiffiger(ph) did that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And we were able to get her out and she was given away to — to a very nice Lithuanian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They took care — they even baptized her and made her like a part of the — and sheSeptember 22, 1994 spoke only Lithuanian and she was — she fortunately survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">In exchange, my uncle — the police officer who was shot, his little boy was also given out to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But he was betrayed and they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Apparently, this Lithuanian that took him was given — were given certain things in order to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">They betrayed him and he was — and we found out later that he was — he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So —
QUESTION:  Do you want to take a break now, or —
ANSWER:  Let me just finish with the — it will come back, the name of the other guy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He was a bad, bad —I should have written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Yeah, so he — what he — he formed — it was already March, April — it was already — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> already knew that it’s — it’s — it’s still a— a—a-—a little bit of hope on the horizon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So he let out the word that he is going to — that he 1s going to let out some people to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And he opened up a-— a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in — was in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And needless to say, he was with a machine gun there, and he killed like 14 people there, claiming that they tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So that was SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Sturmfihrer.

QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Tell me a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> becoming an official <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">ANSWER:  Well, towards the end of the 1943, we s — we saw certain movements in aSeptember 22, 1994 different direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">We — we felt that there is some kind of changes going to be implemented in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And we really didn’t — didn’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">We felt that the guards were changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">We have — we have seen more — that was also a time when we have seen more Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">They brought in Hungarians, and especially some truck drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">One — one of them, which I knew pretty well, he was a very bad mouth, and — but he was not — not so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">But the rest were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">He was Haymushi(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">He was a Hungarian truck driver who — who worked very close with — with Pilgrim(ph) and — and Fiffiger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">He was, like, always with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And we felt that by bringing in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more restrictions, and — and start — they started also watching more of the — all the movements and what’s going on, what’s happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And they were very much concerned and very much were — were looking for — for some kind of supplies that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would supply, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would produce, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would have some contacts with — with the — with the freedom fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So in order to have a tighter watch, they — they have also tried to squeeze out from the police and see whether their police — to find within the police also some people who would — who would be on — on their side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">They were not — were not too much able to — they had not been able to get from the — from the Jewish police, except in — in isolated case — cases, because the police was well aware of what — what wasSeptember 22, 1994 happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And they — they themselves — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was the — with the council in many occasions — and many cases have tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And they were — they knew also sometimes the whereabouts of — of people who — who would go out to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> an-and fight and in different measures and acts of terrorism and — and blowing up <span class="DLF">railroads</span> , and sh — cutting off supplies, and — and shooting in many cases, in back of the — of the — of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Although the Germans themselves, like — the Germans themselves, they — they — most of the time didn’t dare to invade the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was for them, taboo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">But they used for that purpose, they used Lithuanians, in many cases, to — to find out and to find out the right <span class="NPIP">spots</span> and then they would — they would be able to — to move in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">We also saw the — not only by — by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we — we have felt a bigger presence in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of — of the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Because normally, in all those years, they were — they were, most of the times, guar-guarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they were hardly — not too frequently, they — they used to come in and — and — and look for themselves, look in in certain aspects of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Now, in the late ‘43, we have — we had a— a much bigger presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">There were also a repetition of — of people that — of requirements for — for labor force in some other — other <span class="NPIP">places</span> within <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and — and outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , whereby they used to come and — and of course, make a selection, or they used to appeal to the — to theSeptember 22, 1994 council in order to provide them with — with — with those elements who can be useful for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And most of the times, they — they — some of the times they also tried to get some people who — who had some skills, and tried to use them in the best of their — their ability. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">We have seen also that <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , in the — the verstattin(ph) have been over swamped with — with additional work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">As the front was getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to — for — for — for the Germans, for their supplies, and they needed the — the help and the — and the cooperation of this verstattin(ph), so they used to work overtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I mean, instead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And they also implemented some shifts in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">The — the underground movement grew faster and faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">They — they had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians by themselves also were not dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">They saw that the tide is changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So they, in many cases, they tried to befriend, and — and to be a little bit more helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Although, the — the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody that they would have a [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">But we have seen that they — they were more aggressive in — in hiding people and in helping and — and in trying to make up for the — for the damages that they have done before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">When the — in 1944, after the — after the children’s aktion, and after we have — we have brought out our — my cousin from — from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I myself started thinking of terms of — of getting 94September 22, 1994 away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I was in contact 1n two cases, in two ca —
QUESTION:  I have to ask you to say that again because of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">What are you going to tell me about now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Are you going to tell me about your escape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">The guards, and — and more frequently coming into the — to the — to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I didn't see, really a — I mean, they were as brutal as they used to be because this — especially the — the — the foreigners — the Hungarians, they were not — they were not good people, you know that — especially there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">They were — they were as brutal as they are, maybe some — some — some more than — than the others in — in many, many occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">This [indecipherable] the truck driver, I mean, he was [indecipherable] that time when I — I mentioned about letting — deceiving the people and telling them they can escape and so forth and so on, because people have started feeling there, the <span class="DLF">air</span> has changed, in the sense that the front was getting closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And the question was when and how fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">At the same time, they started getting preparations for — for — to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Apparently this was mentioned in — in a — in few occasions that — that pretty soon they have already orders in place in order to eliminate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and to — and to take out all those remains of the — of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">At that time, I think — I’m — I’m sure that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now — maybe now from 33,000 that originally — so what they did is also — when — when they — whenSeptember 22, 1994 they used to — when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became smaller — small-smaller in — 1n — in population, they also start cutting off smaller in <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">What they did is, where we had the Varniu(ph) gatve where the — with the — with the [indecipherable] was the <span class="DLF">gate</span> for the supplies, there was a — a— a number of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that one day they came in and they took a — a—a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove the <span class="DLF">fence</span> that was the original <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">What they did is, they put in another <span class="DLF">fence</span> , cutting off, like, four or five blocks from the — from the original one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">So it became like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> within a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">This was, in a certain way, to my personal advantage, you know, because — and maybe some others, which I — I — I do —I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I can speak for myself on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">What they did is, actually by — by putting a new <span class="DLF">fence</span> and putting guards — putting guards around this <span class="DLF">fence</span> , they have diminished the guards from the overall <span class="DLF">fence</span> , which was before, even without taking off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So, what happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided — I have a— had a — we were five — five people that we decided to — to flee the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We saw that — already that the time is running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I spoke to — three times to one friend of mine that was in the — was in the — in the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And he told me that whenever I want to join them I should — I should contact somebody, and — 1n order to join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">The only thing 1s, after that I tried to get the — the other — th-the contact man and he was already gone, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So I went to my — where my uncle was and I told him, look, I 96September 22, 1994 think that it’s no — no reason for me to remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I mean, it’s — we’re — we’re close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">We’re very close to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I mean, it’s — they are going — one of these days, we are going to get up and we’re going to find ourselves surrounded by — by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they are — they are just going to take us, and — and — and ta-take us out and — and take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or take us somewhere else, or — or — or take us to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So my uncle, who was very conservative always — and he really was very close to me, was — was like — like a father to me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And th-this was maybe one of reasons that — that I have not left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> sooner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And especially my grandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she [indecipherable] that time when I saved her, you know, she — she would not — and we knew that she — she — also — also survived, you know, the — the children’s aktion that time also when — because she was with a child <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , but her, we couldn’t get — get her out, because well, it would be too — too difficult, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">A child is something that — el-else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So what — so my uncle came to the conclusion, say that’s fine and gave me his blessing, I mean, it — and I deciding to — now, how are we going to do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">SoI-—I devised a plan, in other word, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which were behind the first — the general <span class="DLF">fence</span> , a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> still left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They have — normally, in many cases they would explode some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">They would put in some dynamite and explode it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Here, they — they have — and — and they did it later on with the r— with the — withSeptember 22, 1994 the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">So I had a —I had three more people with me — three — four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">There was one — one guy that was himself from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and for — some way he was stuck in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , and never was able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And then it was the nephew of — the nephew of my aunt, who is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlotte</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And then the other one was a guy that used to — frequently to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And then it was the other fellow that worked also with — was a nephew of somebody who worked with my — with my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So, then this guy knew — supposedly he knew the <span class="DLF">road</span> , how to — I mean, where to go in order to get to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>

a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">We felt a new — a new arrangements and — and some things — certain things — certain changes which we — it was not too hard for us to figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">We saw that the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We saw that everything what’s happening with the Russian army, the victorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards — towards the — towards the 100September 22, 1994 west. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And we felt also that there is time for — for me and for some friends to — to get out and get out as soon as possible because every — every day was a matter that — we knew exactly that — what our fate was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So truthfully, we didn't have too much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would — we would not be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">So I went to see my uncle and I told him that — and my grandmother, I told them that I’m — I— I’m ready, with — with my other fellow — fellow friends to — to get out, and to get out as fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">So my uncle I — my uncle also gave me a— he had like a little golden coin and he gave this to me and he said, look, in case of necessity or something, I mean, you — he — he — he had like three of them, you know, so he was hiding that always in — somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So when — soon I got together with my — with my friends and when we went to work, coming back we just evaded the guards and we came into one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that we marked for — for our shelter in — in — in between, in order to be able to — to plan our — our escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">The — one of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a short one, and we used him as the outlook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So he used to look and to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And he was the one that timed the steps of the — of the guard on the outside of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and then came to the conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut through the wires and that was nighttime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And we just slipped out, all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Because we — really the security was behind us in the — in the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> whereSeptember 22, 1994 there was double-rolled barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">This was all — this was a old <span class="DLF">fence</span> which they have never tried to repair because they were — there was — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Now, when we had to — we slept over there in a—ina—ina garden, a dense <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And in the morning we start going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">But we left a distance between ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one, some meters, one behind the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">When we came through a — through a — with a bo — to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had to cross the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , there was one person with a — with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And suddenly he came out and approached us, say, stop, documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Raise your hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">So when he did that, we start running in different directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">It was only one person and we knew that he might shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Besides that, his aim was not too good because I felt — when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me and then I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">I —I— I really ran like never in my life, and then I threw myself in the <span class="DLF">cornfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a while, I know that they — they had some — some people with horses try to locate somebody, and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">But I, during nighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble — flickering lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And I say to myself, without these — would that be headquarter — would — would that be <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> for the Germans or some <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or something? </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Then I steppedSeptember 22, 1994 away and I found myself close to a small, small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And there I slept over the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">It was really — it was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with leaves and some other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And there was a little — a little — I wouldn't say a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , but it was little <span class="NPIP">place</span> with — with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And then I — I was hiding behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">In the morning, I heard some voices 1n Russian, and I — I watched that, and I saw that there — there, a woman came and she — apparently two friends, but one stayed with a — with a metal thing, you know, what they — they put here — put in cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And she started washing right there in this — where there was li — this was not even like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , but it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I had my hat, so with my hat I used to take and — and — and drink the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Because food was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I — I used to collect some — some berries, you know, from wild berries, and this was my food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So I was desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I was very hungry and this woman was washing and I said to myself, let me — let me approach her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And I spoke perfect Russian, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">So I came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I said, look, I’m — I’m escapee, and like you should help me with some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So I was not sure whether she was going to go — first of all, I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I asked her what was there in this — in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where I saw the flickering lights in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And she said, no, that’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian ca- camp</span> for civilian Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">An <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">intern camp</span> for civilian Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">But then she told me that she is going to come back and bring me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And I — I thought toSeptember 22, 1994 myself, I prayed, I said, or she is going to bring me food, or she is going to bring me a German who is going to — to kill me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">About 15 minutes later she comes back with a bottle of milk and a piece of spee(ph) — you know, that’s — that’s from — it’s like meat, fat meat, you know — and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And then I started talking to her and she said to me that she got scared when she saw me, because I looked like I’m an old, you know, the — and I explained to her that I’m a refugee, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And so she said to me, look, we have in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> two Russian prisoners who — who fled, and who are hiding in our — in this — in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And they also are going to — they are planning to go to join the — the freedom fighters, the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And where they are going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">They are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janava</span> , Janava, Belder(ph), that used to be Janava, the forest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janava</span> , which was not too far away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And this guy Scheiker(ph), that was with me, he — he — he was leaving us, and he told us, and he explained to me, because he himself was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janava</span> , and he told us — he gave me certain — certain parameters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">But now, I mean, he was — he was gone, so I had to do that myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">So then, in the — in the evening, sh-sh — the two Russians came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">They had knives for themselves, and they asked me a few questions, and they wanted to verify whether I am legit and I shouldn’t be — I shouldn't be some — the bay — betray them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we approached them, and one of them had apparently a contact, or he knew 104September 22, 1994 exactly a certain <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very friendly by the Russians, because Stalin’s — Stalin’s view was that the Russians should never fell in a prisoner life, I mean, he should give his life for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">But of course, this — that was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So he took us to the forms — <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> at one point and he — then we met about three or four more guys there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">They were from the — from — apparently also, they were former Russian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And they had already a plan, a top — topographic plan, and they had all rolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">So they said that they have received some supplies from — from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parachutes</span> that they — and they had some assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going — if they are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage — sabotage work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">We spent about, I would say, maybe about close to 20 days moving around from one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">one</span> , because we didn’t want to stay in one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And on few occasions — I was not trained, I didn’t — I didn’t know anything about — about ammunition or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">They have done, basically, the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And the — in — in different cases, I was the look out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">They used me to be the look out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They had some — some light arms and knives basically, and they had some back packs with — with ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">We spent, I would say, about four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And one — one day, we heard a movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">We put our ears — normally, what we used to do is, we used to put our ears to the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , so we can detect — that’s a way of 105September 22, 1994 detect whether there is some heavy movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And here we detected that some — based on our imaginations, some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And now we saw about three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> rolling not too far away, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And then about a couple hours later, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And this whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> vicinity became like a — like a — like a military, I mean, <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Because bullets and flying out the — in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shrubs</span> , and saw burning — burning bushes and all this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Then, it lasted for about an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, now we are going to be killed by — by friendly — by friendly — our friendly power — gun power. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Suddenly, it quietened down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">It was quiet like nothing — I mean, like — like nothing ever — anything happened, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And I say to the — to one of Russians, I say, what — what would that be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I mean it’s — it’s too quiet, I mean, we got used already to the — to the — to the — to the incredible sound of — of — of explosions, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And then suddenly we heard again, we put — the Russian put his — he put his ear on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He said, something is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">It’s — it’s quite apparently, but something is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And, like 45 minutes later, we heard — we heard some movement of, like, troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And then we saw the first Russians approaching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And the first question was — the first question was, have you seen 106September 22, 1994 some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I sort of, yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And he said, no, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> already finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Have you seen some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And we say, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Right away it was — I was amazed, you know, because right away I — I was approached by — by one of the lieutenants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I think it was a captain, not a lieutenant — captain, because he had three stars, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">It was a captain, and he — he actually told me that — he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">So am I, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">Okay, we embraced each other and he — right away what he did is, he told us — he said, look, this is the <span class="DLF">front line</span> , and the <span class="DLF">line</span> might change, because we don’t know what — what — what — what is ha — what can — what is going to happen a few kilometers from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">My advice is, and what I want to see you, is to the till. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Till 1s towards the back, towards the [indecipherable], you know, towards the back, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And right away, he called a— a—a soldier and he said, take these guys and take them over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And — and in meantime, we was already approaching some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> and some — some other — some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military units</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And he told us to move as far as possible towards the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">He said, you went through already, it’s sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I mean, it’s — and th-this was the — this was actually the — the — the way that we — so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I mean, the first time we felt like — felt like liberated, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And then he asked me — another guy that he referred me to ask me some question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">He said me whether I want to join the army, or I want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I said, no, no, first what I want toSeptember 22, 1994 do is, I want to go — I want to see — because my question was, how soon are they going to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">He said, that might take still a few days or — or it might still take some — some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">So we were with the army for about — I think about ten or 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> and to liberate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I went right away to the — to the — to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Everything, all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">They have — some people came out from the hiding in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Some people came out from hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were hiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">But supplies and other things that we had in — in our — in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">It was like, everything burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And right away I went to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">This was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> , I got myself — right away I met with this officer, that he told me that he is going to — he is — I mean, that he 1s going to be coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> , and he gave me a number where I can — I can reach him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And he told me that if I have some — some kind of desire of some — something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">I said, yeah, I would like to have — I have some — I have some relatives here, and I would like to see whether I can find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Where — where are there — I— I am sure — I felt they were very optimistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I said maybe there are some relatives that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And I start floundering around for quite a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And then I found a family, that we were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then later, they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">But I used to send themSeptember 22, 1994 packages when I was in there — when — just a minute — that I send them packages after, when I — when I — when I was in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">They — I helped them to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> — a living <span class="NPIP">place</span> because the — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was — was devastated, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">There — there was not too many — too big fights in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but it was many have escaped and left behind themselves <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and you know, like — the same way like when the — when the — when the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So right away I found a—a friend of mine, who told me that if I would like to serve — to serve in the — in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and I speak the — I speak Lithuanian, German, and — an-and Russian, so I would be a good prospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">He se — he told me that there is coming a — a group of — a— a group of people to — of military men to take some — to take — to — to — they are looking for some inper — interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Basically German is not, at this point, is not important, but it’s going to become important later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And at the same time, they promulgated a law that all these people from this and this year, they are going to be — they are going to be from 1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken to the army — to the regular army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And I say to myself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than — than to wait and then be recruited to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">They have like a place where they called wayan(ph) komat(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">This is a— a—a military place, whereby they check out new — theySeptember 22, 1994 check out prospective soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have TB because there were many with — with TB, you know, from those that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So I actually signed up for this — for this unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I remember a younger captain came in and — and interviewed me and he was satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And then what he told me that he is going to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation — military preparation of about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And I agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">In meantime, he told me I can — I can stay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a—a-—a <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">So I found my relatives, those I mentioned, and I found myself not too far away where I used to live before, on the same [indecipherable] on same main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">I got myself a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my relatives were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">They had two children and — and myself and I told them, look, I am going to be just here, and only temporary, and I am — I am going to be leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And also, was very interesting walking on the — when I got myself a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> an-and riding on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , I met a very good friend of mine, this Harmutz(ph), who was the — the head of the ORT. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">He wasn’t in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he was involved in the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And he esca — I mean, he joined in also in the army but in the civilian department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">They made him a — like a commissar, or something, in the civilian department because he — he had excellent contacts in the — with some high-ranking people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">So I met with him and it was incredible, incredible meeting, you know, to — in — in middle of — of — of nowhereSeptember 22, 1994 or something like, you know, in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to meet somebody that was such a close friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Then, from there, I — I was — I was sent toa—toa—toa <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">training camp</span> , and in about six weeks they send me to the first mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I mean, I was recruited, got the uniform, got my — they sent me within <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> to — to be attached to the — there was also — you see, there was also a Lithuanian brigade under the Commander Vilinski(ph), who was — which was formed right when the war — in the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Very brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Many of those people died in — in deep <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , you know, and it was incredible, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">But I didn’t — I joined the regular ar-army, which I — I said that is a policing force,

class="sentence" id="1446">So we have them on our list, we had a — one of the informers was a — had a <span class="BUILDING">gramophone factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">They’re 124September 22, 1994 the one who had the <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">One has a — like a other type of <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , I don’t remember what was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">So what — I used to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , with a side one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">So those people were redeemed in a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">There was al-always the sword of Damocles was hanging over their — over their neck, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">But they were, in a certain way, so long they were able to form, and to give all the information about some more bigger fish, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">So once a week we used to — they used to come to our compou — to our compound — I mean — and they used to meet with the — with the — used to come very discreetly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">We had a special <span class="DLF">entrance</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">And they used to give all — all kind of information, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">So, when I used to — I used to go to meet them from time to time, to visit them, they used to fill up my side, you know, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , like with all kind of meats, and everything, and they used to take that — there used to be Alexanderplatz(ph), which was a — a — a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a very special <span class="NPIP">place</span> for <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , and — and for all kind of illegal activities, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Used to take that over there, and they used to sell it, and then bring the money to — to — to the commander, and you know, to the — and turned it over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">He used to give me something like a [indecipherable] and I was very, very happy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And then, when I used to go with the <span class="BUILDING">gramophone factory</span> , used to be loaded with gramophones, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">They — the Germans, I mean they — they had a—a very interesting thing, it’s when they — when — when they capitulated, I 125September 22, 1994 mean, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">They wouldn’t get involved in the — in the — in terrorist or some other activities, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">In the meantime, I used to go with — with Colonel Baruck(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">He — he was very friendly with the chief of police from — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and they used to go hunting together, and I was with them, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">So one day, I — I became friendly also with the chief of police, and I told him I —I say, I’m involved in — in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one <span

class="sentence" id="1465">I says, and I am sometimes in jeopardy, so I need a — a ausweis — I — a card, as a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">He hesitated, but then he gave it to me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And I say, don’t mention it to anybody, because this is due to my work, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">So, when I met with Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and I disclosed him that I eventually want to — I have relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , and I’d like to get out, because pretty soon they’re going to demobilize me and send me back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , which was — I didn’t have any desire to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">So we start actively pursuing, I mean, how to — what — what — what to do, how to — so one day he comes for — to me, very happy, and he says, listen, I mean, there is a Joint — the <span class="BUILDING">Joint Distribution Center</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> , in the <span class="REGION">American sector</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">Why don’t we go over there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">And I used to wear sometimes, civilian clothes also, because due to my work, I mean, I used to have to be camouflaged, you know, so I wore more civilian than — than military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">So 126September 22, 1994 I say, okay, let’s — let’s move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">So, we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U-Bahn</span> , you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">metro</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And we went to — I think it was in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlottenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">So, we came into the Joint Distribution, and there is a American colonel, and I say, look, I’m a— a Russian and Jewish officer in the Russian army, and I would like to — you should help me to flee, and I — I have my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , and I — I just would like to get away, because — I explained to him, I say, I’m going to be very openly where you — open with you, I am truthfully — I mean, it’s — I — they — I have no use any more to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">I mean, I have already accomplished what I felt to accomplish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">Now I will — what I want is to — to — to get to my family, I mean, because I am by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">They’re going to send me back to — he said, look, we’re sorry, but we cannot do anything, because we have a very good relationship with the Russian,

almost [indecipherable] because I saw here that my — my opportunity to — to — to — to get out, and I thought, they’re going to — like, I’m going to declare myself like a — a—a refugee, and then that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">So he says — he calls on his secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">He said, look, you know where your relatives are in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , what’s their name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And I say, yes, I have their name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">Do you — do you know where they are? </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">I say, no, they’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">Do you have a address? </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">I give to her address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">So I say, why don’t you send — we are going to send a telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">We’re going to sendSeptember 22, 1994 that to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , to make the story short. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">And I thought, I mean, this 1s a— I mean, he just wanted to get rid of me, and then he — he — he just [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">Exactly 20 days later, Helmut(ph) calls me and says, hey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">He says, I have a letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">A month later, and I almost fainted, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I had my, in Yiddish [indecipherable] letter from my uncle, telling me that my other uncle, you know, that I left, and he

<p><span class="sentence" id="1531">ANSWER:  I have a — first of all, I calmed down for a minute, and I was very excited, because that was a— a-—a incredible step to take, you know, because to — to go out — it’s not to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because you see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ha — was in four sectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> by itself, found itself within the <span class="REGION">Russian occupational zone</span> , which meansSeptember 22, 1994 that in order to get out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is not to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I had to get out from the whole <span class="REGION">zone</span> , to cross through hundred — few hundred kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And this is not — it’s not easy, because although at that time, in 1947 — that was already 1947, in that time there was still not — there was still not as tight as it became tighter later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">So I —I figured out, what shall I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">So I had a little, small caliber pistol, which I took away from my German officer, still in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">K6nigsburg</span> — with — the handles were made from elephant bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">Beautiful, you know, it’s — it was something remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And I had a bunch of — first of all, in the — in the army, the Russian army I was paid as a officer, I received a certain amount of money in Russian rubles, and then a double amount in German occupational marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I had money, I had more than what I can — was able to use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">And incidentally, I used to send — every month I was able to send two packages, and I used to send to my relatives in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">Every — every month I send them two big packages, with all kind of goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">So then I had my — End of Tape EightSeptember 22, 1994 Beginning Tape Nine
QUESTION:  I'll let you finish —
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">Let me finish — let me finish this part, which is — I will tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">One day, I will talk to Spielberg, you know, one day we’ll — we’ll make a very profitable film for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">So — so I had my German ausweis, which I got from the chief of police when we

little caliber pistol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">And the little caliber was — was — and you will not believe for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">Not to shoot anybody, but to shoot myself if — if — if they would — if they would catch me because there’s no question in my mind, th-they would — they would have done this without any reproach, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">So — and then we moved to the — moved to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I figured already everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">I figured we have a long voyage to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which is going the direction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> is in the eng — in the British Zone of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">But I felt that — I figured out, I said, I know that this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to

thought to myself, it’s going to come in a German guard, I’m going to show them that I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">And I didn’t have aSeptember 22, 1994 problem because I — I had also this Baruck(ph), my colonel, was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">He was in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> for a conference, and I had the right to — to — to travel to a certain — certain distance, because I need — I needed a special permit, which I didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">But I could — I could justify my trip, you know, because I didn’t — I didn’t carry with me any — any — any belongings or anything, it’s just only a small thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Then I said, if it comes a Russian, I’m going to identify myself as a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">What can I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">We — we travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">I mean, so crowded it was that — were unable to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">Suddenly, we come to a certain <span class="NPIP">point</span> , there’s soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Russian and Germans together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">I say, that’s my day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">That’s my day, what shall I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And I had to think quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">I was next to the guy with the — with his wife, and we were chatting and — and here comes the guard, documents, documents, documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">I ventured to pull out my German rather than Russian, and I think I made the right decision, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">In the middle of — of — of — of looking at my — checking my document, the child starts crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And some way that tension was deflected, and I was da — I — I think it was a sheer — sheer luck for me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And they just only ask me where I travel, and I said — I knew right <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">So why do you come [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And I said a few words in German, you know, and — and my worries were over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">They came to the — almost to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">We come off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">Then he said to me, no, we have to go now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">We have to walk now for about two 133September 22, 1994 kilometers, because there is a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I will always go through, but there is a very little where — sometimes even — they don't have even a guard on the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">Because you see, it’s not a natural <span class="DLF">border</span> , now where they — which they had — when they made later, in the later years, like when they — when they had the air supply, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and th-that was much more difficult to escape now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">But in 1947, was still — you know, it was still at a point where the war was still — I mean, they were still not — not so organized now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And I remember when we

not the last, there were quite a few people who — who crossed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">Apparently, this was the place where we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">And there was a big sign that said, you are entering the British Zone of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">If you have some armaments, or some

id="1595">So who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">What ha — you 134September 22, 1994 are not a smuggler like you told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">I said, no, no, I’m

id="1620">He had a little, tiny-miney room, you know, big as my <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">And he says, we can share it, I mean, you can stay

</span><span class="sentence" id="1626">I don't know how many people are aware, but I-I don't think too many are aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">I’m going to tell you that they — they have transplanted <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to some — they — they used to take them to different parts of <span

the IG Farben company from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and they are supposed to be shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> to dismantle completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">Not only dismantle, what they have — our assignment was to take the workers, including even the — the — the — the lowest paid guy, like, the — the — the guy that cleans the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Everybody had to be placed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> by five o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">And we used to come with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and say, out in five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">Sei haben five minuten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">So you have five minutes to — to get your belongings and — and out on the

compared to what they have done to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">But it was, I — I cer —I found a certain — although, I didn’t have anything against the — against the guys, those guys that worked there in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">Now, this — this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , for a fact, they were so organized — the — the —September 22, 1994 the Russians were so organi — disorganized, that it took them X amount of months to reach the destiny for the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">And then they found out that part of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> went to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smolensk</span> and the other one went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">And tha-that was the what — what the — but if that — what th — I had to mention that, because that was a very, very unique experience, you know, whereby I — I was in charge of — of taking — I mean, to — disassembling and taking those people to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> at five o’clock, and — and it — 1t was a— a remarkable — you know, sometimes you remember certain — certain — so okay, so wh-when I came — when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I — it happened to be those people that I used to send packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">Those relatives were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1641">QUESTION:  They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1642">ANSWER:  Next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , and the other was — was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">So I stayed couple days in Prather’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then he took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , because they are — they’re relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">And this lady, Fruma(ph) Lankavich(ph), she went out her way to accommodate me and to — and to — and to help me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">And what — what I wanted basically is to — to get — get out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and go to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">So there was — I asked her — from there, I wrote already freely, you know, to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , and they — they send me some — they send me letters, and they send me also a letter saying that they have — September 22, 1994 they instituted a visa in — in — in fr — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to go to — I mean to — in order to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">Now, how do you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">I don’t have any — any — any documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">So I start working on documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">In the meantime, a guy came by and he said that he is — he’s capable to — you know, we’re very desperate, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">The time was now important to — to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">I mean, we just wanted to reach already a destiny, after so many pain and suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">So we had — the guy said that for a hundred dollars, he is going to make me false papers to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">So I — I found a— a-—a friend of — of the family, with the name of Bernard Picard(ph), who also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">And he was a brigadier, the other brigade, Bernard Picard(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">And he le — he lend me the — the hundred dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">And I gave it to the guy and he made me this paper, it didn’t look to me good, but I figured he — he — he knows what he’s doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">But through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , and through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saargebiet</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">And when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , the Sareté came out, the French police took us off an-and — and sent — was going to send us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">And I— I got very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from the Russians and I just flushed it down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">Because I figured maybe they are going to send me back to the [indecipherable] — you know, that time you were fearful, you didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">They might send you back to — to your destiny, where you — you were coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">So then I came back to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , and we start working legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">138September 22, 1994 And she helped me so much, this Fruma(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">Fortunately, they went later to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and she’s passed away now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">So then — then I was able to — I got — I got already the — the real papers went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and then there I had my visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">I spent in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> a few days, and then I found out, in order to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> — to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , I have to go through <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I need a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">This is eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">You had to wait for eight months for — to get — to get a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">So I started — I had all — I found also a other guy that was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , by the name — same name like me, Abraham, but his name was Rabinowitz(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">And he told me, wherever you go, I go with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">I said, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">So I start walking up and down in — in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and — and looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">I spoke a little English, you know, it was easier for me because he didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">And I start looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">Finally, I found — we found a maiden flight of a six-motor <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hydroplane</span> from Air France, that was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dakar</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port-Etienne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">And from there — and to — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dakar</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port-Etienne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">So we — what I did is, we had our tickets from Pan American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">We exchanged that, and the company, they gave us credit and some way we hustled around and — and all — all togeth — and all together, what we had was 10 dollars in our pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">Then we took the trip with this six-motor hid — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hydroplane</span> and it took us — it was an incredible flight, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">They gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">And then when we came to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port-Etienne</span> , we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antigua</span> — British 139September 22, 1994 Antigua. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">So from there, we went — we had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and go there, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British Antigua</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British Antigua</span> , we found out that in order to go to Cuba, we need still an American transit visa because we have to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Puerto
