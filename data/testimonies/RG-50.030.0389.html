<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think I was allowed to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I do remember to my shame, that afterwards, a day after or so, I was told to go out to do some shopping or other, and my mother asked me to bring her some -- some -- something to calm her nerves, in the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I’d forgotten that. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And haven’t -- haven’t ever forgotten that I’ve forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And she needed it badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  And when you did go out, did you see anything unusual?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Yes, I saw the -- the men in uniform, standing outside <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> , and preventing people to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I believe I remember that, it might be that I saw pictures of it, but I do believe I remember that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  What were those four weeks like without your father at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="626">What did your mother do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Well, my mother was nervous, and I didn’t bring her any-anything to calm her nerves, but I’m sure afterwards she did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Don’t remember that, whether she try -- if she went to the police, and -- <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and tried -- tried any -- I don’t remember that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  My sister was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">My sister went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in February, so that was all at that time being organized to get things --
QUESTION:  So tell us about your father coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Well, most men who came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had a shaven head, but as my father didn’t have any hair on his head anyway, so he didn’t look very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I don’t think he -- yes, he did talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">He said it was very, very hard for many people because they were beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But if you were put in a <span class="DLF">line</span> , and were told to keep still, and somebody hit you from the back on your head, and you turned round, that was almost fatal. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">There were two kinds of people who managed better than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">One were the wa -- the soldiers in the first World War, the others were the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The Communists at least had an ideal, and knew what it was -- for what they were put into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And the s-soldiers, former soldiers knew what discipline was, so they didn’t turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So he wasn’t treated as badly as some. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Bad enough I’m sure [indecipherable] and the fear was very great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  Did you feel that he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I mean, what was the feeling those four weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Looking back I think I always knew he would coming ba -- one didn’t know about these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">terminal concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They didn’t exist at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So we always hoped and thought he’ll be coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Or maybe I was just a child, and felt things will turn out all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Well, if your father wasn’t working, then how did your mother provide for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">That’s a mystery, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I’m sure there were a great many savings, I don’t know what happened in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Whether other people helped, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> as such helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I can’t tell, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  And you say after he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , then they tried to emigrate, what was -- where were they trying to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">To <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">To the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Later on also to south ameri -- atose -- <span class="REGION">South America</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I remember a letter, very late in the day, when we were already in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they even considered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> because that was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the world where you could go where there was -- without a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">That’s to say there was no system of closing the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But the sister of my mother went there, and it was very hard life in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And she wrote back, “You better stay where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">It couldn’t be worse in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="666">To her everlasting shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But even so, I’m not quite sure whether my parents would have brot -- came up with the courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I remember reading somewhere it would have been so far away from you, or it would have been so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I mean, people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">They’re all living today in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , if they haven’t died a natural death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  When you say they tried to emigrate, what did that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Did they spend the day going to <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , or what did they [indecipherable] that mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  A -- no, my fa -- my father had a brother who already immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , so I remember him traveling to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to try to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I think he rather enjoyed the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">As a -- was not much to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">But, I mean, it was a serious undertaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Subsequently his brother and his wife were also deported and murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">His two ch -- do- their two daughters survived, they are living today in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I think they survived in hiding, they were baptized, which was later revoked, and they could tell a very good story, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  What are their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  The one lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , and the other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  And what are their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Mariana Greenbloom, and Hannah -- she reverted to her maiden name, Saxe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So when your father traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , di -- was there ever any consideration that he just perhaps might stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Nothing illegal ever entered into my parents mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I mean, there wouldn’t be -- no sin attached to it, whatsoever, but I don’t think it ever entered into their mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I have friends who went over the <span class="DLF">border</span> illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">But <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wouldn’t have been a solution at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  So at that point when they were trying so hard to emigrate, what were they saying about the future? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Wh-What were they saying to you about why they were trying so hard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Well, at that point, we -- everybody knew why they have to immigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">My sister went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> a few months before I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I think she went in February, I went in -- in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">She was beyond the age of kindertransport, she went as a housemaid, she had a permit as a housemaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Now, my parents tried very much to go and g-get into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a married couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">He -- he couldn’t drive, but as a gardener, and as a cook, or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">My father had a course in -- came up yesterday -- in pedicule. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Oh, and I have letters when he -- they tried to learn English, and they had courses to learn Spanish, and my mother had a course in learning to sew underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So they were preparing for immigration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  And when do you first remember hearing about you possibly going o -- to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> by yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  My <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed down Christmas when there was a [indecipherable] vacation, Christmas, ’38, and from then on it was -- tried very hard to get, generally, children out, and even if it was an opportunity open still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  Your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed permanently then? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">You said your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed, did it close --
ANSWER:  It -- 1-1t -- 1t was closed, yes, permanently. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">It wa -- finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  How was it closed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  By decree. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Strangely enough that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a very tiny <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , was next to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Himmler, and that he allowed those Jewish children to make a noise in the interval, and play around, and his two blonde children looking over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and watching us, it’s one of the amazing things, and I think he was too busy really, doing hart -- harm, to -- to bother about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But in -- in December we couldn’t go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, that was finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Do you remember saying good-bye to the teacher that you liked so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  I met her again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">No, I don’t remember saying good-bye to her, I don’t remember seeing her. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But I think she was behind the organization to get the children out at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  What did your parents tell you as they started to talk about you possibly going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  It was generally understood that immigration has to be done, and there was a saying, what a good job when we have the children out, I mean to save the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I might add that from the moment when the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed, till I actually could immigrate, three months, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">household school</span> , I was supposed to la -- do I -- do -- do something, not to let the children just hang around and not doing anything, and being [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So I learned how to sweep and dust. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Not very successfully, but that -- that -- some were allowed to cook, but I don’t think I ever graduated to cooking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  So how -- you say your parents were taking classes, how was your mother preparing you to possibly leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">What was -- what else was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Was she teaching you anything, or buying, or making clothes for you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  At one poi -- point during the trip, it was an adventure, we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But beforehand I don’t remember what I really thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I thought it was a necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I was homesick, even then, before I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But that’s -- can’t remember any more reaction to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Everybody was preparing to go, so it was nothing special that was just for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  Do you remember your mother helping you pack, packing you the few nights before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  I don’t think it was a question of helping me, I’m sure she packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And there were lists made of everything that was in there -- in the [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">You were only allowed -- oh yes, so nothing variable left. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I mean, you couldn’t take any money with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I left with 10 marks in my purse. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And with two knives and two forks, and two spoons, silver cutlery. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I think my sister took more, because she was more marriageable age, and her relatives gave her -- her father’s brothers gave the money to -- I don’t know, her. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I remember she had a set of coffee cups, and bed linen, and that sort of th -- that’s -- I didn’t take it on her -- s-she was more marriageable age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  What were you supposed to do with the forks and spoons?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , but there was a stopover in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avri</span> , and we could go make a land excursion, and that was an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I mean, I’ve never been outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and that was an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went on, and landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> there was a number of ladies who gave each child a box with sweets, and sandwich, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">Waterloo Station</span> -- this is all very vivid in my remembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And we sat on wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> , and the name was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">You see, some youngsters went to -- with the kindertransport to s -- to a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Some went to a Quaker organization, and many went to private people who wanted to take a Jewish child in. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I was one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">We didn’t know the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">There was some correspondence beforehand, but -- so the name was called, and the name of the person who would take the child in, or the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or ever was responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And that really when life started in earnest. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">There were many children crying because they only realized at that moment they had left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I don’t think I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">But then my name was called, and the la -- the name of the lady who was expecting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I had an aunt living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at the time, she was at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">She waved to me from afar, greeted me in some manner or other, but not very long, because people didn’t want to interfere, or be, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So Mrs. Stevenson took hold of me, and we walked away, and she drove me to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  Mrs. Stevenson was your guardian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  What -- what was your first impression of her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Oh, she was an elegant woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I was lucky, she could speak some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">She was of Austrian extraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I think she was a little bit Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I mean, I say a little bit because she didn’t make much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But she’s been in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I think of -- of a first generation, second generation, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So she could speak some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Because I’ve learned English at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but there’s nothing much to -- about, about my English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  When did it hit you that you had left your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  At that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I mean, it’s a complete stranger, and I was 15 going onto 16, but in those days one was still considered a child, and was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I was expected to go -- I expected to continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but when I arrived and they realized in a month or two ti -- ti -- I -- I will be 16, they said, “N-No more <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for you, it’s too expensive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="823">You had to be a uniform, and whatever, no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And was a -- that was a very big blow to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  What was your first day or night like in the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  Probably very sad, I don’t remember well. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">She was really -- I don’t know -- I can’t to this day say why they took some Jewish German child in, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">She was a very hard woman, extremely hard woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He was a -- a nice, warm, maybe too warm man in his, I would say early 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">He was -- had been born in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , Scottish extraction, and he was a typical colonial English -- Scotchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to study medicine, lived in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> for many years practicing medicine in -- in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , and then he went to -- back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">He had to practice in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Was both their second marriages, and he was a widower, and she was divorced, and she was a charming, good looking woman, and I think she was as cold as ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And -- which doesn’t make sense why I -- why they took a German Jewish child in, but that’s how it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  Did they have other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">He had a daughter, and she had a daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">QUESTION:  So when you got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you weren’t the only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  No, they -- their children weren’t living there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  Later on in the war, her daughter came to live there, and I moved from her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which today 1s perfectly clear, and normal, and right to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I had a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I had to move out -- out of that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> into a <span class="INT_SPACE">maid’s room</span> , which hurt me very much, but I don’t think that would have -- should have done much difference to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  So -- so what -- what were your feelings in those first days about being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  About?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  About being there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  I was terribly lonely, I had ho -- was homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">My sister lived 1n -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I must have talked to her somewhere, although I didn’t meet her very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I didn’t get out there- it wa -- it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I -- where I went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surrey</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Croidon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Oh well, I don’t think I had much feeling, I just was raw and traumatic -- traumatized [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  And if you weren’t going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what did you start doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Then they decided I was going to be a children’s nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I was going to be trained as a children’s nurse, and I was put into a <span class="BUILDING">day nursery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">That’s to say, day as far as the children are concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">The -- the nurses, the trainees stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And that was --
QUESTION:  You were sent to a -- like a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  No, it wasn’t a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> --
QUESTION:  No? </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  -- it was -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">day nursery</span> , a real <span class="BUILDING">day nursery</span> where the working women left their children in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  Oh, a <span class="BUILDING">daycare center</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Daycare center</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Okay, okay, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  Well, that was an extremely hard time for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">In the morning, the di -- the children changed their clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They had clothes that belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">daycare center</span> , and they had to be washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">So one of my jobs at one time was to wash clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Now, there’s no harm in this, if somebody tells you how to wash clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I can only advise you never to wash clothes like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I didn’t have any more skin on my fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I mean, my life has been saved, so I’m not complaining, I’m just telling you. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">In the morning my -- my fingers were all raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I couldn’t hardly do this, but I had to wash washing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Do the washing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">For some reason which is not understandable, we’re not given enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Not because there wasn’t enough food, but because, I suppose, the matron, and the sister learned at some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or other, you give so many grams of these vegetable, so many grams of that vegetable, and so many grams of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I suppose that must be the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And you didn’t help yourself, you’re -- just like David Copperfield, it was put on your plate, like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I was always hungry there. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Now, the other fellow nurses -- trainees, were also hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">But they went into the larder in the evening, secretly, and took whatever they needed to satisfy their hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They didn’t take me with them, but they said afterwards when it was found out, that it was me who had taken the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I mean, that sort of thing I’ve never encountered in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I was taught sort of, one stuck together. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I would have gone with them, I would have helped myself too, I was never a -- my English was as good as non- existent [indecipherable] in those days, and yes, I remember there was -- we were sleeping all together, 10 or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And I had a drawing which I very much liked, and I took with me, my drawing teacher did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And I put it with -- I put it on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> with pins -- with -- and every morning it was found taken down. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Now, I wouldn’t, if I live in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where there -- a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where there’s a <span class="DLF">wall</span> , I wouldn’t advise anybody to do this either, but I would have talked to the girl, and said don’t -- please don’t pin it up, makes <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">But it’s just taken down, and -- and that sort of -- those sort of things were very bad to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And I had -- I remember very clearly that I had to take care of 25 children who had a rest after lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And they were supposed to close their eyes and Sleep, if possible, but at least keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Well, under my care they didn’t keep quiet, and I didn’t know how to ke -- let them -- how to manage to keep them quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So I shouted at them, and I remember very clearly that I always said, “Shut your eyeses.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Which was a great success in the way of humoring them, and they thought it was very funny indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So that was a -- and I remember more. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I remember that every two weeks -- it could have been every week, there was no reason why half of the trainees stayed over, and the other could leave for the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But however -- before every -- before that half which had the weekend off could leave, the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> had to be cleaned, washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Now, after awhile I realize if I just throw water over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , that’ll do nicely, and get us off quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">But I had thought that cleaning the <span class="NPIP">place</span> means taking off whatever dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So it took me -- I’m always -- I’ve always been slow, it took me ages to get it, and the others couldn’t leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So that didn’t -- couldn’t leave until everything was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So that -- that didn’t make me much more popular either. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">On the other hand, there was a party at -- which wasn’t very far, the people, Stevenson, I lived -- I had -- they had brought me over, didn’t live very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">They had a party, and there was cake left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And the rest of the cake was brought to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I had a chauffer at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">It never occurred to me, I wasn’t brought up that way, it never occurred to me when I had the cake, not to vide it -- divide it among everybody in equal parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So everybody had something, but they didn’t take me into the larder with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">One of the things that had to be done to be a children’s nurse one day, is to knit -- to knit something for a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Well, I would never finished it, because there was always some -- something wrong with it, and I have to try -- like Penelope, I always say to -- to [indecipherable] again, and start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I would never meant -- made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">That war broke out in September, and the -- the children were evacuated, and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> closed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So I went back to those -- to family Stevenson, and thought I was lucky, but then my hard time really started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  How -- why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">QUESTION:  Ho -- yes, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  Well, I was a housemaid there, I lived with the family, which didn’t help at all, didn’t make it any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I got a very small amount of money each week, tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Two dollars or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And I was terribly lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Occasionally I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> with my sister, my relatives, and a friend, very good friend, but most of the time I was terribly lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I -- it was suggested to me -- and don’t know now whether it before I went to the child care, or afterwards, it was suggested to me that I join the Girl Scouts, and I did go there one afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I never went back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And they were so -- there were uniforms, and -- and military drill, so to speak -- maybe it wasn’t as bad as I -- I had the ex -- impression, but 1t reminded me too much of Nazi Germany, so I never went back, which was a big mistake, I might have made some [indecipherable] there. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But nothing could make me go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  Why -- I -- why didn’t you live with your aunt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  Every -- well, these people made me come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">They -- they gave the guarantee, and whatever it took. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So, one of the things was not to interfere, after all, they took on the responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">On the other hand, my aunt, too, they had -- they were economically not settled down yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I mean, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">After three years, they decided a child -- a child- I was 18 by then, had to learn something, so I -- I did go away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">It was very hard, they didn’t want to let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I was a very bad maid, but I was very cheap. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And was a hard struggle, but I did go to my aunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  How -- how did they treat you? </span><span class="sentence" id="936">You mentioned that Mrs. Stevenson was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Did -- did she -- just what was it like to be in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with her? </span><span class="sentence" id="938">How did she treat you, or -- did -- did you have conversations with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  By the time I learned to speak English, I had conversations with her, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I don’t think she had any understanding of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I used to write letters, that took an awful long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">By hand, of course, not by computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And I don’t think we had much in common, but I can tell you one thing that might illustrate the coldness. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I told you about our Christmas celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Well, in the beginning of December, or the middle of December, it was decided that the family was going away somewhere for Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">There was another maid in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she was also a Austrian refugee, but she didn’t live with the family, she came over as a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Everybody was going to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> couldn’t be left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">So it was decided that I should stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So I stayed all alone over Christmas in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Snow was falling, to make it a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Well, when I learned that I couldn’t leave, I couldn’t go to my sister, to my relatives, I had the first nervous breakdown crying spell in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I couldn’t stop myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Afterwards, when it came to the 21‘ -- 24" of December, I’d calmed down, but it was very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So that might illustrate the coldness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  And this is your first within a month or two of you having left your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">ANSWER:  No, I'd left the family in March.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">QUESTION:  In March, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">But it is your first holiday?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  Were you in touch with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">At that time, that was still ’39, there was regular correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">No, no, in -- war broke out in -- in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">But there was still some -- I could still get Red Cross messages, which I have with me, across [indecipherable] I think they went by <span class="DLF">porch</span> -- via <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , and they could -- my parents could write on this -- on the other side of the -- of it, a reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  Did you tell your mother what was going on, or what was the -- what were the contents of the letters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  I don’t have my letters any more, but I don’t think I described it very drastically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  I think we’ll -- we’ll go ahead and stop now. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  -- would like to talk a little bit about, you were in a -- a communication with your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Do you remember the first letter you got from your parents when you were living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember the first [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  Okay, or -- or any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  But, I mean, they wrote about daily life, they wrote about the birds, which -- the canary and the parakeet, and with people they met I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">They wrote about my friends who came t -- who were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , who came to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And they were constantly writing about the possibility to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and that these people -- the people my sister stayed with, they were very kind, and they tried to do their utmost to get permission for them to come over, and -- looking for a job as a couple who take care of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And that was a constant worry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">QUESTION:  Did you think that they might come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">ANSWER:  Yes, we hoped the would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">QUESTION:  You were out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this point, and you were perhaps maybe beginning to hear more about what was going on with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">What -- what was your sense of what was happening in your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you had left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">ANSWER:  We were sure war would broke out, and I don’t know whether many people thought so, but it never occurred to me that Hitler, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could win the war in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I mean, it was just a question of evil against good, and it was just impossible that Hitler could win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Which wasn’t a factual statement, because it was very possible that Hitler might won the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">QUESTION:  Did you -- I mean, when you thought of your parents, you thought about them coming, did you worry about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  Yes, but I don’t think I was more aware -- or fantasy didn’t reach the point to which they could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I mean, the worry wasn’t as great as it should have been, if one could have imagined things that happened, could happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  Was there ever a point when you will -- that they had to move out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you realized it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  No, no, luckily they’d never had to move out the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I -- I only realized that re -- fairly recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I did think somehow, I don’t know why, that they had to move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">They were deported from their own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">This one of the very few, small, consolation ca -- I had.</span></p>
