<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  How religious was your family?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We had an hour of so-called religion, both in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> and then later in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which is a <span class="BUILDING">classical high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But | am afraid we were not very good students. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It was just something you had to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Doris Rauch 3 July 7, 1995 Page 3
QUESTION:  Now you said you lived in a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of non-Jews and Jews as a child growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Were there any problems when you were young with any of your neighbors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  No problems at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We never -- | personally never knew about the Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Maybe it was kept from me, | don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that you went to, was it a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> or --

<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  So your schoolmates were also non-Jews and Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And in addition, there were Germans and belonged to the so-called Sudatin (ph) German where became the worst Nazis there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So | have very mixed feelings about my former classmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Sentimentally, | feel very attached to them, but on the other hand, | attended a couple of meetings with them in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But | broke up with them completely because they behaved as if they didn’t know about the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , as a child, did you have any other interests outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Any hobbies? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Did you do anything else besides go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Well, we went on hikes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And skiing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Did you belong to any youth groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  No, | did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">| had quite a few cousins my own age, so we very often played together and did things together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Did your relatives live nearby? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Your extended family live nearby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Everything was -- almost all of them were reachable on foot, or at the most by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Doris Rauch 4 July 7, 1995 Page 4
QUESTION:  Then you went on to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , you said. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And did you have any other outside interest at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">At <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Well, | took French lessons and English lessons -- no, English -- yes, the last two years of the -- My <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> didn’t have any modern languages except Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You talked -- | mean the language -- the instruction was in German, but you had Czech as a foreign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And in addition to that, | was very often sent to Czech- speaking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in the summer so that my Czech would become perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Was this your family went away? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">or you went away by yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  | went away by myself to friends or relatives where the main language was Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And we had no other modern languages, only Latin and Greek in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So | had private lessons, first in French for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And | was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to speak French fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And | also had English lessons later on which really stuck with me because the teacher was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">With French, I’ve totally forgotten, almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And | even learned Spanish one year, when Hitler was already occupying us. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Occupied myself, | guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Or for possible immigration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Were you interested in music? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Dance? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Any of the arts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  | took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> for | don’t know how many years and was absolutely unmusical. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And one of the happiest days of my life was when the teacher said, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She doesn't think it had any use for me to learn piano anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That is as far as my musicality is concerned. . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We had, what you call it, gymnastics and dance lessons from a very good teacher whom we adored. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And that was something very pleasant in my youth, going twice a week to those lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Doris Rauch 9) July 7, 1995 Page 5
QUESTION:  So you said that your friends, some of your friends, and your teachers were not Jewish, but you don’t recall any anti-Semitic incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">It was a very pleasant childhood growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Well, pleasant, perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But you know, when my father had all his business difficulties, a child fears that even if they didn’t talk in front of me, but | knew there was something going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And | had to inherit the 10,000 Czech crowns from a great uncle of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And so, | knew that my father needed money, so | offered him my 10,000 crowns, which I’m sure would have been a drop in the bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, you know, | remembered this. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But he lost his business and my mother’s brothers took him into their business, which was a wholesale fur business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  That was in the early thirties; | don’t Know exactly which year. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So | was, | don’t know, ten years old or twelve years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  But you still were able to do other activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">| didn't curtail my activities at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">When did you start noticing, then, a change in your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">When did conditions --
ANSWER:  You mean as far -- well, when | was, | think, 17 years old because --
QUESTION:  This is 1937 we’re in now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  1937, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">For instance, one of my fellow students told me | had remonstrated with him, that he didn't do so well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore and he was a very intelligent guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he told me that he was very tired because every night he went across the <span class="DLF">borders</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for Hitler's coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">| didn’t even believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">| Doris Rauch 6 July 7, 1995 Page 6 thought he was just bragging in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But today | know it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So -- and do you know then in 1938, Hitler occupied the Sudatin (ph) line? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And | felt very strongly that my parents had done the wrong thing, that they sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And | wore a Czech flag on my lapel in that year after Hitler really occupied the entire state and we had to wear a star instead of a flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But | still feel that today that it was a great mistake that | did not go to a <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So of course, the outcome would have been the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  But there was a choice when you were younger to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, the choice was not up to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">| mean, the way we go to our -- yes, | could have gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Yes, | mean, your parents had the choice, but they decided to send you to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> 
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">| went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that my father graduated from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Alright, so it’s now 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Yes, but there’s a big event before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My father had lung cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he died in 1936, when | was 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And that was very hard on me because | was very close to my father, much more so than to my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  And how did that change your life and your mother’s life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Well, my mother tried to make a living by renting out a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to two girl students. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">She did all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">She had a representation -- no, you don’t say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Anyhow, she sewed, knit woolen materials to friends and got a commission on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And then she sent all her friends to certain <span class="BUILDING">coffee shop</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And there they had to say Doris Rauch 7 July 7, 1995 Page 7 that they were sent by my mother and she got a percentage from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So my mother was very capable, although she never really worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But she was very intelligent and very practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And although there probably was some money, my father hadn't left anything because we just lived on his salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But | think my mother inherited money from her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And | know she had stocks in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> because | used to go with her to collect the coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But she always made an effort to earn some money herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  So that was 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Anything in 1937 that you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Well, | was -- you mean as far as anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Or personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, | was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> that summer, into a French-speaking family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  What did you know about Hitler at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, we knew quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Perhaps not |, but my mother had a very close friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldham</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my mother went to visit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And she smuggled out some money from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before they immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So we knew what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then, also, Hitler occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in 1938 and one of my mother’s brothers lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So they all immigrated first to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> (ph) before they attempted to get a visa to someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And they did eventually go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to unoccupied France. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And they got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> maybe 1940, 1939 or ‘40.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Do you remember being particularly frightened in 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But that was perhaps because | was so naive, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">| grew up in a very protected way. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And | was rather childish at that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And my mother used to Doris Rauch 8 July 7, 1995 Page 8 say, “Nothing will happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I’m happy here as long as | have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over my head.” </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That was her constant saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">| would have liked to immigrate, but it wasn't easy because we didn’t have any money out anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And it was very difficult to get a visa to anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But some of my friends succeeded, but we didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And now it’s 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Any other changes that you can recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Of course, | graduated from <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But | could no longer go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That was 193--. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">You know, | don’t remember how that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Anyhow, | could not study. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And my mother said --
QUESTION:  Why could you not study?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Because they didn’t admit Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Here you’re a young, 18-year-old young woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  | don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Probably not very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But | was not -- as | said, | was very naive. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And all this didn't touch me somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And my mother decided | should attend a Class in a Czech -- that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We were not admitted to German-speaking universities. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Maybe still to Czech, | don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But | went to a Czech, you would call it maybe post-graduate textile school because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> was full of <span class="BUILDING">textile factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And the so-called English cloth that was so famous really came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> and was treated in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">You know, they had a special process they treated it with. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But it was woven in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So she send me to a <span class="BUILDING">textile school</span> which did not interest me at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">| mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there was a possibility that perhaps | could become a designer. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">My mother still saw that we could live a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But it was a wasted year so far as my future --
QUESTION:  So you did go and study textiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Doris Rauch 9 July 7, 1995 Page 9
ANSWER:  | did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">| graduated from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It was a lot of fun because we were only two girls and the rest were all young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So we had a good time, not knowing what was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So | graduated from there in June of 1939 and we were already occupied by Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  How had your life changed when you became occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Well, it all came very gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">First, we had to wear yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And then we had a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We couldn't go into the <span class="DLF">street</span> | think it was seven or eight o'clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We had to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Then we were concentrated into certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which meant that my mother -- because we lived on such a <span class="DLF">street</span> , we got, so to speak, renters into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">There were several -- there were two families in addition to us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was only a three-room apartment with one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  What did it feel like to wear the star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Well, it was, what is the English word? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It was not pleasant.</span></p>
