<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  Okay, it’s called “Return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wertheim</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="603">I’ve made my peace with the past, my peace with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Not with the SS trooper — troops who goose-stepped past our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on cobblestones, singing, no, shouting in 0 — in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then we will all be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The tune has etched itself so deeply in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome words, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the memory of that night, and by — and by my masochistic instinct to remember the event, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We fled the bubbling cauldron that was to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic, to the land of cowboys, Indians, and <span class="DLF">streets</span> paved with gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">To jobless <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , in Depression, but breathing the air of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">As the family eked out a living, each one of us working for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers 1n a strange <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I was hurt by our

my family, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , too, had our roots in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wertheim</span> since 1405 A.D., as the gravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a finalApril 23, 2017 insult to the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Wasn’t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of the living? </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in true snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">In the postwar era, I shunned everything German. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I refused to buy anything German. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I refused to make love to Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I refused to ride in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German car</span> , especially the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> that Hitler had extolled. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Until one day, I confronted myself with this enigma. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil, to be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Now, I was stereotyping all Germans, shunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all universally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I woke up to the realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of the Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that occurred 100 years ago, right here in <span class="REGION">California</span> , a bounty on their scalps. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Right here, in the good old <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span> , the land of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and Lincoln, the land of Wounded Knee, and My Lai massacres, and many more. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So I made a conscious decision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">The same kind that I experienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults at me, without ever bothering to know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">A heavy weight lifted from my shoulders, the good vibes that I now felt, must have echoed, reverberated, April 23, 2017 ricocheted around the world, and must have found the psychic antennas on the roof of <span class="BUILDING">Wertheim city hall</span> , must have been received and heard by Josef Scheuermann, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wertheim</span> ’s democratic mayor, who was scouring the world, searching for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ’s 100 living Jewish survivors, out of —’ [break] — group therapy, they — and you know, I didn’t learn very much about how the — what happened in their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Tha-That maybe —

id="631">I don’t know whether he joined the Nazi party or not, the chances are, he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Everybody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Ye-Ye-Ye — I

id="639">If a farmer bought a cow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a — when the — when the crops came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So — so a lot of those farmers stopped doing
