<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  But, I understand you didn’t stay there that long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  No, it — we were invited, we were the guests for the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And then my father went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> where the same brother had the insurance company of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleet</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Volga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You see the — it was the — well, see family and my father directed the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My mother and I went — stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because first we — the whole family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and my father left. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And my mother and I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We had rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of a theater critic. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And he always — his wife was not in good health, and he used to always to take my mother to first shows in the <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which at the time, in the 20s at that time, was in full swing. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I was attended — was in — registered for the first time in my life to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because until then I was home tutored, both in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , always I had home tutors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  So tell me, what was it like as a young girl, as a refugee? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">By then you had lived, actually in four different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> for varying lengths of time.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Although, at — by that time — by that time we were no longer officially Russians, because we never got back, as it was understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So we loos — lost the citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We were at that point citizens of no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We didn’t belong, we had no protection from any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And a member of the then League of Nations, by the name of Nansen(ph) has created for people like my family, a special document which was called the Nansen(ph) passport, which was not — didn’t look like a passport of a regular <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , which was a sheet of paper with some name, date of birth, indication — all the information that the passport has. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But that was our passport, and forever gave us trouble, because usually the people at the <span class="BUILDING">casa</span> — the <span class="DLF">borders</span> had never seen such documents.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  It is a different organization of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I knew that I had to help the — with — the family with finances. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So I registered in a <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> and I decided I’m going to continue my education at this first opportunity, and did it throughout my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I went to <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">By that time it was summer, and one luxury that my mother permitted herself, was to once a year to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> to visit her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So while she was away, it so happened that the t-touring club of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , which is like the ma — automobile association here, was looking for somebody for a member of their staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And they usually request that somebo — to send them somebody the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> where — that I was attending. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And before I even had finished it, the director of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> picked me to ask me if I was interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Was I interested? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So I have — was very proud that I got the job before my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So that was my lengthy period in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , until May 10", 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  That means before then though, that while you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> corresponded to the time that Hitler had come into power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and later on the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , before that the annexation of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Were these events that you were following at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Did you ever think that it would reach <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> , or was it far distant news?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well, you — it — it was — it was — how should I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Nobody could imagine what could d — that something of that caliber could ever happen to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">On the other hand, I must also confess, to my shame, that at that time I was a very — how should I say — carefree, cheerful, a little bit superficial girl who loved dancing, who loved friendships, excursions. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Politics were not my strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My husband, if I had met him that — that <span class="REGION">area</span> , we would have never seen each other again, because he was very much involved in politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He was active in the labor Zionist movement, very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So, it is funny, we lived in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for 10 years, both of us, had many common friends, and never met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  So let’s then move to the day, May 10", 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  What are your recollections of that day, and what was the response of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  That day — that day was a sunny, beautiful morning and we r — I remember waking up and couldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I thought that 1t was a thunderstorm. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the — how is possible, the skis — sky is blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And all these explosions, c-could it be a thunderstorm? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So, it’s — it was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But then of course, word came out immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I went to work, everybody went to work, and for us, very soon people started — as soon as people understood that it is the Germans who are invading, those who had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and funds, started moving, moving south.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  And did your family leave immediately, or did they —
ANSWER:  No, not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  — debate at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Not at all because we had no means — the little means that we had, it is only very recently before the invasion that we moved to our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we used to have rented <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> before, at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My parents lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and I lived in the little — small, little <span class="INT_SPACE">attendant room</span> downstairs, it was very — really, it was my mother who managed everything remarkably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , we shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was very, very difficult life for them, and again, not very much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">For me it was all a very easy going — so, what I was going to say that the big expense that we have made the — before May 10", maybe before the one May fifth, is to buy a—I cannot say a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> because it was not electric. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It was a cold box, you know, with pieces of ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And here if the war breaks out, the day when that ice thing was delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So — but, I must say that the president of the touring club, who was an unusual person, told me, because one, I was a fit — I think I was the only Jewish person in the staff — don’t stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Whether you have means or not, take what you can carry and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Take the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and go south. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and see what you can do later. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And what he said was — was very meaningful to my parents, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So, after two or three days, that’s what we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Did you have any trouble leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Yes, because after — when we were almost at the <span class="DLF">French border</span> , there was a bombardment at night, and they broke the rails, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> couldn’t continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It so happened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , so we left the — the one or two suitcases that we had at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and continued on foot, going south.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Were you carrying any luggage with you at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Just —

<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Wagon</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Anyway, we arrived in — and then there was a festive reception in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaillard</span> , and we had chickens and the ducks and the goats, little goats, all that mixing with the people in the reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was most unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And then, the next day we had a re — a religious wedding from a rabbi who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to be [indecipherable] and married us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I think in the book there is a photograph of it, where all the people who at that time were in the [indecipherable] many more came. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And they made it wonderful, and for those times, that was a dinner, that was a feast. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So — and yeah, now, the only thing was, I had no clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The wedding was in the same suit that I wore coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">On the <span class="DLF">road</span> , in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But for the wedding at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I had to wear something a little more presentable, but I didn’t have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So a friend of mine happened to pass by, and we had similar figures, she lent me a dress.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Had he ever met Rabbi Weiss before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But he knew of Sam because he worked very — was very active in the labor Zionist organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So Sam had this visa — he, as a matter of fact, had already used the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but he had given it to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">My children ask me sometimes, why didn’t he go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , why did he go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I cannot answer that, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">He probably had reasons for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">One though that comes to my mind 1s that his parents were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">His father, rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">His mother was already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And he was — he was — he needed support, financial support, and that, of course, was not possible from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , because people went there to dig <span class="DLF">roads</span> , and to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And Sam wanted to get a job and su-support his father, and that’s what he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  So you had the visa, was —
