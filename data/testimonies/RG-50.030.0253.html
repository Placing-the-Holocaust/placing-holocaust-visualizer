<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Hi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Tell me... Uh, give me your name and when you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I'm Curtis R. Whiteway. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newburyport</span> , Mass[achusetts], in 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">November 3rd.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about yourself, and your advent into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And, uh, then we can talk about your career in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">In 19...the December 1943, I was drafted, uh, into the, uh, Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And then, uh, uh, we're at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Devens</span> , Mass[achusetts].' </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And then, uh, couple of days later, taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , for, uh, my major training in the armored forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I continued on then, uh, after graduating there. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Instead of going into the armored, uh, division, they took a group of us, uh, that were apparently high in the records of, uh, achievement; and they sent us to <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> , to the Rangers, where we received 19 weeks of very intensive training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Then you went overseas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Then we went, uh, to, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Maxey</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , and joined the 99th Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Uh, there we were supposed to train a lot of the troops, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And we went immediately over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> (clearing throat) by way of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , well, we trained for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Invasion training. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And then, uh, very shortly, why, we land...we went across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> in LSTs and landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Havre</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And we had a little bit of skirmishes there; but, uh, we moved inland, uh, into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And then we relieved the 9th Infantry Division on <span class="DLF">line</span> , in uh...1in around the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Li¢ge</span> [Flem: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luik</span> ], <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  And then, what happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh...uh, of course, we were totally green. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We had a lot of experience, uh, there 1n, uh, training, but, uh, totally green to combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And, uh, about a month and a half later, uh, on December 16th at dawn, the Germans attacked us with, uh, uh, over 10 to | of their prime German SS troopers, Panzer Grenadiers, the, uh, German, uh, paratroopers, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And just simply overwhelmed us on what we now call "Hell's Corner." </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And, uh, like, uh, my company, uh, of--as I understand now--of approximately 216 men, there were only 29 of us survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then, uh, we, uh, managed to hold the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We wiped out the 3rd Panzer Division’--uh, with...with great help of our artillery, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And, uh, then, uh, within ' Located near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ayer</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="33">This would have been well after June 6, 1944, since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Havre</span> was held by German forces until September 12, 1944 when it was captured by the British 1st Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">° This could not have been the 3rd Panzer Division, which served on the <span class="REGION">Eastern Front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Probably about another month or so, why, we began getting replacements and were again ready for combat and pushing into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> .”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We pushed, uh, into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , uh, forcing, naturally, the German army back, or...or Just wiping them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Uh, I'm making it sound a lot easier than, uh, what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But, uh, we...the main part is we came to, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koln</span> ]; and, uh, then switched, uh, south to, uh, the...one of our armored divisions had captured a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> now know as the <span class="DLF">Remagen Bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were immediately pulled out of the fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , and pulled south. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And my battalion was the first, uh, of the 99th Division to arrive there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And we went over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that night, under very heavy fire, took the [Epellolai (ph)] on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> --uh, which is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> there--and held it and until other troops could get up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we pushed inland, and made what is known as a <span class="DLF">bridgehead</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was tn this <span class="DLF">bridgehead</span> that we first came upon our first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The army (clearing throat) had never, uh, informed of ...us of anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh, so that we were not mentally prepared for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Uh, the first few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , uh, that we came to, we were ordered--being combat troops, our mission was to fight and destroy the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So we would part, and go around these huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and re-engage on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In doing this, we came by...many times, the...one of the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And here, uh, uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men would normally be detailed to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , unchain the people who were chained and so on, and release the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Uh, the rest of all the combat troops would, as I say, continue engaging the German troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">As we went by the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , we would see, uh, handfuls, or, uh, quite a few prisoners--or, uh we now call them, survivors--would come <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="DLF">gates</span> [and] be standing there as we were passing by, either on foot or on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And they would be waving to you, and they'd be all smiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And if they got a chance, they'd come over to you and hug and kiss you and shake hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And this threw us off guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Because now, when we saw all these smiling faces, we assumed that they were alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And we just kept on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The only ones to see any of the horrors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , not... For us, not realizing that many of them were not physically able to come out of the <span class="DLF">gates</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  The Germans had already left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  The Germans normally, uh, in my experience, uh, would normally stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps--</span> the he is referring here to the 9th Panzer Division, which served in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and suffered heavy losses there. * </span><span class="sentence" id="64">English name for the <span class="DLF">Westwall</span> , a <span class="DLF">fortified line</span> along the <span class="DLF">western border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">guards--until we were approaching one of the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And they would withdraw out the back, uh, side, uh, opposite side, of wherever we were approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And what I...we've learned is that they would normally take selected prisoners--usually Jewish people--uh, out the <span class="DLF">back gates</span> , and keep on taking them in forced marches, uh, further into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And they would continue then to try to kill them as fast as they could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh, we hadn't learned that at this point, uh, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And so it was a very tragic thing, uh, to be able to permit the Germans to...to keep on murdering people like that. (</span><span class="sentence" id="71">Clearing throat) They usually beat them to death with rifle butts or...or bayonets, or just shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But they...we also learned that they had to be very careful about not using too much ammunition, because they were going to need that to fight us. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So we continued on fighting, continued past the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> --except for our handfuls of men that would go in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  There many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  There were many camps like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we continued pushing north into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , until we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen</span> is due east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remagen</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giessen</span> --or in that <span class="REGION">area</span> --uh, my group was Selected to, uh...at nighttime, swim the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> [this would have been the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lahne River</span> ], come in quietly behind the German guards and the engineers at the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and quietly take them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And then cut the, uh, cords to all the explosives on the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">At dawn, or about dawn, then our entire regiment or battalion came in on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks and tanks</span> quickly; and were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> before the Germans knew it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Now, I was ordered to take my men and go down one of the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We fought from <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But in this <span class="REGION">area</span> was very different from many of the other areas in, uh...1n Europe--and in particular, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Because we came upon the most appalling odor that I have ever smelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And there's no way to really describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh, except to bring out the, uh, important points that, by now, in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> like this we're all very experienced combat troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We had seen all kinds of human misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We were used to the odor of death, of, uh, flesh--burning flesh--and all this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But this odor was, uh, very distinct, and very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We had to find heavy cloth in the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that we were fighting in, from the German soldiers; and hold it over our faces while we're trying to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Because this...
QUESTION:  How large was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was quite large. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh, I would compare it, uh, with the size of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malden</span> , Mass[achusetts]. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Of, uh, say around a 100,000.</span><span class="sentence" id="94">° Somewhere on that idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And, uh, as we pushed down on this particular <span class="REGION">area</span> , why, the odor got worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we finally came to a big <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> , and a huge ancient <span class="DLF">wooden gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Upon top were barbed wire, machine gun nests. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">There was no soldiers there, at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Uh, apparently, each time we finally approached ° Giessen was captured March 28, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">° Giessen had a population of 31,601 at the end of the war; by the 1980s its population had grown to 76,374. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">the camps that the guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> would not engage us. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They would run instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Unlike the Wehrmacht or the regular infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, when we came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , we knew we had some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And we put TNT against the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and we blew it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Ran <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , dispersed to cover each other, and engage what we knew would be the, uh, the Death['s]- Head--from experience, the Death['s] -Head SS troopers’ uh, that normally ran these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadamar</span> .* </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh, it turned out to be, uh, an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Uh, why I say that is because they weren't keeping the prisoners there for long periods of time and starving them and tormenting them and torturing them and terrorizing them, like in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that we would go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">As we burst into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and spread out, I saw in front of me a row of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Wooden, one-story <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">In front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , at that point, was a large group of...what we called in those days "slaves," for lack of any other word. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Now we call them survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they were standing there totally shocked at, of course, the explosion of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> being blown in, these strange men in strange uniforms running in. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And they didn't know who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh, I since learned, of course, that the Germans kept all the information, news, away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that...thus not ever giving them any hope of surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I knew that these people were of no danger to us; so I immediately, being combat, turned my attention to the left, to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And I ordered my men to start going through the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and start cleaning them out--in other words, engaging the German soldier, the SS troopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Uh, at that point, one of my men came for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And he asked me...he says, "You'd better come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he had a voice...his tone of voice was very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I followed him across the <span class="DLF">yard</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ; and as I, uh, observed, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> --to my best memory now--was a <span class="BUILDING">masonry building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The <span class="DLF">windows</span> were all sealed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Outside, as I can remember now, was, I believe, eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> , all up on blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">In other words, they were in permanent position. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The wheels had been taken off. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The exhaust were piped in through the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I... We couldn't really understand what this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="DLF">door</span> ; and there's a couple of my other men there, standing there waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ....there was nobody 1n there, other than my own men. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But there was human excretion, vomit, urine, blood all over the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">At this point we're looking around, somebody had asked me what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I really had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I did not understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">None of us did. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">One of the men went over to the <span class="DLF">far wall</span> , uh, as I remember to my left. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And there were shower heads and faucets all over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He turned them on. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He called out to me; and he says, "What the Hell's going on here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I looked over questionly. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And he said, "There's no water." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I just shook my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I didn't know. "</span><span class="sentence" id="145">Ger: SS Totenkopfverbande. * </span><span class="sentence" id="146">According to US military records, the 99th Infantry Division was in the immediate vicinity north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadamar</span> on March 27, 1945. * </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Also: "Facility E."

QUESTION:  They were killing right up to the moment...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  To the moment that we arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Uh, which was something very, very hard to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Uh, but, as I mentioned, that, uh, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we learned that they were taking prisoners out the <span class="DLF">back gates</span> to continue that time of killing what they called "prime prisoners." </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And it took us a while longer before we would learn that fact, and then begin to outmaneuver them.

small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We came right to the middle, apparently, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself--of the <span

id="259">There were some small <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The odor, again, was terrible here. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Uh, I radioed in to the captain, uh, that we had come to the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and some kind of a camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">He ordered all of us to turn left, and go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in that direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Apparently, one of the other companies was on our other flank would go the other direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">As we walked along the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and we kept looking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Of course, we were in a

some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And we passed a <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Whether it was the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But we passed a <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And at that point, now other...all the rest of the company was, uh, was progressing the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Some [of] them--uh, American soldiers of our own, uh, outfit, and probably of our own company--were already inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Only a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And, I believe, two men came over toward us and started waving us anxiously to come in to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So I radioed to Captain Pat,” or the company command, and told them that we, uh, uh, were requested [to] uh, help, uh, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He gave us permission to move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So as far as I know that only my squad turned and went into the uh...to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">As we were walking in, as I say, there was bodies laying literally all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And as I can remember, here again on my left as I was coming in, there was some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And there was a gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I can't distinguish in my mind at this point whether there was just one or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I believe there was more gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But there was no rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It was...it was wire that they were using for a noose. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Uh, during the short stay in there, one of the survivors--and there weren't very many as far as I know--had explained to me what the Germans were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">There were pile...piles of bodies all around the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And they were taking the prisoners, and making...forcing them to stand under the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They would tighten the noose around and then they would adjust it up on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So they would pull them up and stretch them, so only their toes would just barely touch the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And they left them that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And as I can understand, as I remember the prisoner telling me--or the survivor--that it took something like about 15 minutes for them to die that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And, of course, this was very disgusting to us, at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We were also looking... trying to look at other things that we were seeing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The...we were starting to wander among the bodies, to see if we could help some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And each one that I came to, I knew just by looking at them that they were beyond help. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Uh, even...even...we didn't have any medics in our company. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They had all been shot in the head by the snipers. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And what little medicine we had.... Well, [there] was no medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">All we had was bandages, by that time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Uh, I came to...now as I remember, uh, a nude woman. * </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Tt is by no means certain, but US military records indicate that the 99th Infantry Division could have been in this vicinity between April 17 and April 21, 1945.

And this 1s something terrible to me, in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">She had a rope tied around her legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But it wasn't in a position where apparently the prisoners or somebody had tied ropes on her ankles and dragged the body out. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And it confused me. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Why would the rope be tied around her legs? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And I was standing there pondering that, uh, fact, when one of the survivors in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> quietly came over beside me. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And he began talking very softly. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And he told me; he says she was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And as the baby was being born, the SS troopers took her clothing off--or ripped her clothing off, I think, is the way he put it--and then tied a rope tightly around her legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And then left her and the baby to die that way; because, naturally, the baby couldn't be born. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And, of course, that upset me very, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">In fact, I've had some...some rather terrible nightmares over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And I remember then getting orders to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , while others....

First, I thought they were women; because they had a long robe on them that went all the way to the ankles. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Now, I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were allowed out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that we were going to come to. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh, and they were on perhaps burial detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh, but the idea of the long gown or dress on them was that they were hobbled, so they could not run. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The bottom [of] the uniform or dress was very close at the ankle. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But what they were doing there was they were hiding behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">There was quite a few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And they'd look around, just like rabbits; they were so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Then, one by one, they would get up, pull up the skirts above their waist. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And we kinda snickered, because here they were...we realized they were men. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They were totally nude. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The only thing they had for clothing on was this, uh, dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And they would hold it above their waist; and they'd run and then dive behind another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and drop their skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And as I say, it was kind of humorous, at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But they [were] working their way to close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So I signaled for the men to skirmish and get ready for a gun fight, yust in case. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And we were all camouflaged, and, uh, so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Then these men worked their way fairly close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And all of a sudden, I stood up and I challenged them. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I almost scared the living daylights out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They didn't know we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They dived in behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And when they did, some of them started to cry, started to beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Uh, one man finally came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And I kept telling him in broken German, uh, "We are American solders." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And, uh, tried to get them to understand that, uh, we were not, uh, going to harm them. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And one man, in particular, came crawling out on his elbows and his knees--almost like a caterpillar. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And he crawled quite fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And he [was] working his way toward me; and then he turned around and put his hands up in the form of a prayer, and kept begging me in some foreign language, apparently not to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I tried to console him and uh...here again, tell him that we are Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">He finally, suddenly, under... comprehended what I was trying to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And he look...looked up, and said something in a foreign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But... "American?" </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I shook my head yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He went like a machine gun across the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , came over to...uh, in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Now, he was breaking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And he was shivering all over his body; and he started kissing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and started kissing my shoes, or my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And uh, then he wrapped his arms violently around my legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And he was crying his heart out. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And then he turned around; and he spoke in a foreign language to the others to come, and that it was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Here again, these prisoners were just like the ones back at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadamar</span> --in a terrible, terrible shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">So I asked them in German, uh...uh, "Wo ist der deutsche Soldaten?"--"Where is the German soldier?" </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And they pointed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We...

and he brought his men in--approximately eight or nine men--and he...they ran over and stood beside us, and tried to hold this crowd back. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I called out to...here again, Applegate--which was a very tall man--uh, and I told him...I says, "You take these women out of here, and get them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Get them out of sight, so I can get control of the crowd." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So he doubletimed the women out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Later, he come back and told me that he had marked them for war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We were beginning to understand there was something very wrong in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So in the meantime, once he got them out of sight, uh, then I started talking to the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I started telling them, "There's not going to be any killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You're free. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Do you understand this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And the crowd, of course, the...they were so infuriated at seeing these women that, uh...the...there was electricity in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">The hatred, the bitterness was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And it was very obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And so I kept telling them that I'm not going to permit any killing, and, uh, that "You're now free." </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But they couldn't understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And all of a sudden, in the crowd, uh, there was a lot of people talking very excitedly to certain people, which it turned out to be, uh, people who could speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And so they would interpret these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And they began--I remember this very distinctly--one of the first stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">There was a Jewish woman right out in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And you couldn't tell very, uh, well a difference of a woman from a man in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They were so badly starved that a woman's breast is totally dissolved by her body. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So there was no hourglass shape, or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They had basically the same clothing as the other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Their hair was shaved off their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Usually, I could identify by the tone of the voice whether they were male or female. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And this woman spoke out; and--in English--and she started telling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Uh, uh, she tried to describe what the German women--these German women-- were doing to these prisoners daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">That they would take a group of perhaps 20 to 30 prisoners, and march them in two ranks to a specific part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where the <span class="DLF">slit trenches</span> --the toilets--were. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And now as I mentioned, there's no flesh on their bodies, so they could not physically resist anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">One German woman, *’ Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Staff Sargeant Alfred Hall of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Winchester</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">as she described, would get down on her knees in front of a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">She would reach up and grab two prisoners by the back of the head, force them down on their knees, force them to bend over. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And then push their faces in human excretion, and hold them there until they smothered to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">All the time laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">As well as the other German women, who were surrounding the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It was, uh...as she described it, was a daily game for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">In the meantime, all the prisoners in the two ranks had to stand there and watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But also they had to understand that each and every one of them, this was going to be done to them before they were done. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And they did this daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Another person in the crowd called out. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And they...uh, he was yelling something about the dogs, the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then he began talking about how the Germans--guards--some of them would be going with packs of dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And at any time, they would suddenly just point to one of the prisoners and command the dogs to attack that prisoner and tear him apart viciously. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And as I have described to the kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> today, as bad as it was, at least that person...it was over for that particular person. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But for...the psychological thing that happened, and what the Germans were doing, was that they were putting the fear into all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So they had to think from then on that, "When is it going to be my turn?" </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The Germans, uh, we...we're learning that they could not simply just kill somebody; but they had to humiliate and they had to terrorize, all at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">There were many other stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Another person in the crowd began calling out; and telling me, (clearing throat) here again, about the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That in the winter, that the German guards would select a prisoner--man or woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They were given--him or her--a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , a hot shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And immediately take them out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> nude into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , in the snow storm; and command them to sit there, surrounded, uh, by killer dogs who were, uh, placed...commanded to be on guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And this prisoner... Now the guards would go back into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And this prisoner had a choice of sitting there in the snow storm and freezing to death, or move and have the dogs attack them. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And they went on telling me story after story. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And finally, I put my hands up. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And I told them, I said, "I've heard enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I don't want to hear anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It's all over." </span><span class="sentence" id="598">At that point, as I can remember, a little Frenchman in the crowd began to sing quietly, very hoarsely, the...""La Marseillaise"--the French national anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">As he began singing, then some others--spotted all through the crowd--began to sing along side of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Apparently, they were French. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Then, Bob Riggs came for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He said, "You'd better come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So the rest.... These men.... Americans were still standing there, now that we had laid our weapons down. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Uh, but at that point, the survivors--as we now call them--began singing other songs that...that I didn't recognize. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We...Bob took me over to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the women guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">As we entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the first <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a...what we in the army call a "day room." </span><span class="sentence" id="607">This is where, normally in the army, you would write letters, read, and relax. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I was so shocked when I walked into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I pretended I didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I turned my attention; and off to my right was a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I quietly... And now there were some of my men, a couple of my men coming in; there was a few survivors coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Nobody at this point was talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And I went down the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , and I looked into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And each one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> was neat, just like a normal army, uh, <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Orderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">All the uniforms were hung up on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> was made in a, uh...uh, military, uh, fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Everything neat, and in its <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Nothing was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And this puzzled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And I turned around, and I walked back out of the...away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , and back into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were lamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Some of them had several lamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The lamps themselves were made of human bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">The lamp shades were made of human skin with tattoos. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I recognized that immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I walked over and was starting to look at different ones, and tried to comprehend what all these things I was seeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The little French in...uh, uh, my interpreter now, the little Frenchman came over beside me. "</span><span class="sentence" id="629">Monsieur, do you understand what that is?" </span><span class="sentence" id="630">At this point, his face was covered with tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I said, "What...it looks like human skin with tattoos." </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He says, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="633">He says they would find a prisoner with the tattoos, and hold him or her down out here in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And then they, uh, would actually skin them alive, these women. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">He made a point that it was these German women. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They would actually skin them alive, somehow; and then hand the skin to the prisoners, who had to somehow cure and make these lamp shades. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">On the <span class="DLF">walls</span> all around the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> were picture frames, all different sizes, with human skin and tattoos. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">On the shelves... Well, off to my right, a row of shelves along here, there were male sex organs had been cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">All different sizes. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I believe it was Bob Riggs, but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">One of my men was down [at] the end, right by the <span class="DLF">hall door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And he just motioned to me, uh, with his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">As I say, here [we] was not talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And I walked down to him; and he nodded toward this object that was in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And I... can remember just thinking, "A hairy blob. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">What is it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Because I was only 19 years old at this time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="648">Clearing throat) Uh, "Monsieur..." The little Frenchman had come up beside me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He said, "You know what that is?" </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And Bob didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He said, "That's a woman's crotch. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They held her down, and cut that out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And preserved it, and put it right there." </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And I was pretty well disgusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">There were sexual organs--breasts and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Male and female sexual organs, all over the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , all preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">There were human heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">There were bones of different kinds, and... And by this time, my mind was becoming boggled with the things that we were finding in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I left... At that point somewhere, Little Cheeco--one of my men, uh, an Indian--came for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And he says, "You'd better come with me, again." </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I followed him out of that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , leaving the other survivors and...and some of my men there. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">We walked out across the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">At this point, the survivors were all still stinging, uh, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And we were approaching a small <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that I took to be like a <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">A small first-aid <span class="BUILDING">building</span> 1s what it looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Much like here, when they go swimming in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I came up by the <span class="DLF">door</span> --and by this time, I apparently been kind of getting used to the horrors that we were finding. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And I called out to Big Chief--a six-foot seven Indian, uh, a huge man--was standing right in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , with his back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I called out to him, "Chief, what have you got?" </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And he just turned around slowly, and he looked me with the most God-awrful look of shock on his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And he couldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">His lips were quivering. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">He was trying to say something, but he couldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So I saw an expression on his face; he decided what to do, and he took a giant step to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , out of my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And I entered the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> --as I say a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> --the Germans had erected some kind of a board upright, much like a sheet of plywood. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And here, they had taken a prisoner and they had stripped him; and they had nailed him with spikes--common spikes with the heads on them--through his elbows and through his wrist that I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Nailed him like this, spread-eagled on that board. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I could see where they had taken apparently a scalpel, and they had cut his throat on the side here...his vocal cords somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So he couldn't scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So, in other words, apparently they...they did not give him any anesthesia. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He was looking at me and he was shaking his head; and he was begging with his little eyes, pleading with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They had begun... They had already taken and cut open, uh, his chest, and taken his rib cage off. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And I remember on the left side of, uh...of him[, his rib cage] was hanging on nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They had taken some of, uh, his intestines, and hung them on the right on nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I could see his lungs--bluish and foamy-like looking--uh, pulsating inside of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">In other words, they... they were dissecting him alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Experimenting on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You know, some of the other men behind me coming 1n now were getting shocked like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I remember Goggleye saying, "What in the Hell are we going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I said, "Get outside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> here." </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Because we...our radios--uh, the 536, we call it--uh, would not work inside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> like they do today. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I said, "Get <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Call the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Tell them what we've found." </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Which he had already been reporting, uh...everything. "</span><span class="sentence" id="699">And give them the name, the identification of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Tell them, for God's sake, somewhere, get a hold of a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">A surgeon, in particular; to try to help this man." </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Then I ordered everybody to get out of that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , so that perhaps we could save him and not give him any disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Because we were all filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And so I sealed the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> off that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And then I went back to the, uh...the uh...group of the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And this [was] a sea of humanity, of survivors, out there singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And I began talking a little bit with them again, and telling them that it's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And it's about at this point that they began to understand that they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Because now they turned and started looking at each other; and there was tears coming down their faces, but there were smiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They began to hug and kiss each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And you kno...of course, European men, especially, will kiss each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They began to take and hug each other...uh, and cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And they started, a lot of them, locking their arms together; and they began singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And it was very, very emotional thing to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And as I say, it was the beginning of them really understanding that they were liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  The SS men had already left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  The SS were already...at least deeper into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; and were on their way out, uh, with, uh, "prime prisoners," out the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">This 1s the first time that I can remember that we realized what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">That some of the other prisoners had, uh, told us that the SS-- apparently through all the excitement and everything else--now one of us has asked them where 1s the...what...what happened to the SS there. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And they told us, "They're going out the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So I...1 remember radioing the company, and telling them that this column 1s going out the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">The...we had orders then to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and rejoin the company, and fight for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So I called all the men together. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We formed a <span class="DLF">line</span> down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and we started marching forward out the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">All the survivors were following us. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">As we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ....

QUESTION:  So you started out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Now, you must understand that an awful lot of these things that I have been describing is very, very difficult to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Did you ever find out what happened to the man who was, uh, spiked against the board?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">No, uh, that I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Uh, I have often wondered about that; and people have asked me about that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Uh, we had to leave him in that condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And (clearing throat) so we turned; and we started, side-by-side, walking down this main <span class="DLF">street</span> with thousands of the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And I don't... And I'm not exaggerating. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> must have been huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And they were all walking behind us, very quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And, of course, I turned around a couple of times; and I told them, "You people go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Because we're going to start shooting now, and I don't want you people hurt." </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But they stayed nght with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And it was almost like a parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And shortly, we came to the first <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And suddenly, a woman--a German woman--come running out the right hand side, uh, toward me. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And she, apparently, knew that I was the commanding, uh, man in this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">She reached me and grabbed me by the shirt, and locked her hands into my shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And she began begging me. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And she said, "I was teacher in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , uh, before the war." </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And then she looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">She was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And she started telling me that she didn't know anything of what was going on in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="754">I didn't know! </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I didn't know!" </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And I became rather infuriated at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I turned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Now all the...most of the European people are smaller than we are, except for the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And I turned around; and here's a sea of humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And I could see over the top of their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And I could see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , uh, which wasn't very far from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I could see the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I could see the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I could see the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I could actually see the...the hanging ropes, where we cut all these people down. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And incidently, in those ropes... Hopper had come to me, uh, earlier, and he brought me over there after they cut them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And these people--most of them that had clothing on--they tied their wrists behind them, and then they hung them by the wrist backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">There was two people, two men, that were nude. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">They tied their wrists behind them and...with piano wire; and then they took a hook of some kind, and they ran it through their privates. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And they hung them upside down and left them that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Which is an appalling thing to do to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Anyway, this woman came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And she [was] telling...trying to tell me that she didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">The odor of this whole <span class="REGION">area</span> was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And then I turned back to her, after looking back at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and even seeing the ropes from this distance; and I slapped her hard across the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I was infur...I was furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I called her a...a damn liar. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And she fell to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , let go of my shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And we all walked around her and kept on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">All of a sudden...and I ordered my men then... Now, [when] we got to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , I said, "Some of you guys start going through these...this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Some of you guys start going through there." </span><span class="sentence" id="783">All of a sudden, the...the survivors themselves began running like mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I said, "Whoa!" </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I started yelling at them, "Whoa! </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Wait a minute! </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Come back here!" </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I says, "You can't go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">There's going to be shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And they're going to go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And I says, uh...and I realized now, looking at this massive crowd that there's no way 16 of us are gonna, uh, control this mob--especially if they get excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So I told them, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">You help find the...the German soldier." "</span><span class="sentence" id="795">But," I says, "He's my prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">You bring him back here, and you put him right there on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I'll stay right here." </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So I stood in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">My men and the survivors started going through all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , all the <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> , and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They found...actually found armed, uh, Wehrmacht soldiers, uh, and dragged them down the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They were spitting at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">They were kicking at them, and all this; but they, uh, abided by my rule, and they brought them and threw them on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> beside me. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">When I...I noticed that they would start getting excited and start talking like mad, then I would tell them, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Go find me some more, uh, German soldiers." </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And they'd take off and they'd start scattering, running again. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">When they did that, then I ordered one of my men to take these prisoners; and take them back behind and turn them over as prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I didn't want a massacre here. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We finally came to the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , after going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">There wasn't much of a fight in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">The...most of everybody had deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And then Captain...uh, the Colonel of our battalion ordered us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Uh, which was normal procedure; because we knew once the German army found out that we had taken the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , that they would actually blow up their own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So I turned around to the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And I told them...I said, "Now, I want all of you to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">We're going in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">All of you go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , where you're gonna be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Because now the Germans are going to shell the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and blow...destroy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And I don't want you people hurt." </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They abided; and they turned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Uh, many of them throwing kisses to us, and that kind of thing (clearing throat) there. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">The... We went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and dug in for the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And then I started to walk from <span class="DLF">hole</span> to <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Little <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> , two men usually in each <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I was checking for the positions, to make sure they were digging in the right <span class="NPIP">position</span> for defense and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">As I came to each <span class="DLF">hole</span> --and I'm standing up in the dead of night, and I'm looking down at the men--and I believe that every single man was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And they'd look up at me; and generally, the gist of it was that most of them looked up at me and said...asked me, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Of course, I understood what they were asking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Why did the Germans do that to those people? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And I had no answer for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">The next morning, or sometime during the night, we moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And we began engaging the German Army and chasing them through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And, uh, we came to a huge valley. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">The entire battalion came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And the Germans were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> ... and with ack-ack batteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And they were firing...now firing at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So that Colonel Hook decided that the only way to take them was to order us to, uh, spread out as far as we could, and stand up and walk across the entire <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">As we got...uh, I had one of the points. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">In other words, the foremost troops in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And as we come to the edge of the, uh, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> and started to go up the <span class="DLF">hills</span> , the Germans that were up there on the artillery guns began to desert their guns and run. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We climbed up and began [to] overrun the guns themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And at this point, I noticed two of my new men, that, uh, just came into combat for the first time, had three German SS prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">The SS wore different uniforms entirely than the Wehrmacht did. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I noticed...at that point, I ran...began to run over to where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I fired a shot at one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">One of the SS troopers had his hands down like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And I fired a shot at his feet; and I yelled for him to "Hands hoch!"-- [to] put his hands high. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And my two men began to call out, "Well, we got the situation well in hand." </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I told them they were crazy; that they were almost dead men. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And I pointed out that the one SS trooper with his hands down low was reaching down to touch the buckle on his belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">It was a big brass buckle, with a Swastika and so on on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Touch a button, the heavy brass buckle dropped down. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Instantly, three little tiny barrels of 22 shots drop down and would fire directly into your belly. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And we.... Thus, we called them "belly guns." </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And so all this time that I was chastising my men and teaching them this, I was watching the eyes--or the faces--of these SS troopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They had the Death['s]-Head SS insignia on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">So then I knew by the expression on their face, that one...which one could speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I addressed him immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And I said, "Were you men in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> behind us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And the SS trooper looked at me, and he realized I knew he spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And then I searched for a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And I knew it was ridiculous for me to ask him why they put people behind the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ...behind barbed wire, why they tortured them and murdered them and all this; because of the attitude of the German nation at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So I finally decided; and asked him, "Well, why didn't you, at least, take care of the...treat the diseases in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And he look at me, and he stood erect. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And he said, "Why should we? </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They were all going to die anyway." </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I had everything I could do to control my temper, and not kill the three of them right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So I reached out, and I grabbed the, uh...the, uh...the Death['s|-Head insignia off all three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I took the belly gun off the one; and I took another belt buckle off the...off a second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And (clearing throat) with our morals.... And people have asked me many times since then, "At the scene, or leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> When you left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> why didn't you go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and shoot every German that you found?" </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And the only answer I have is that because the Germans--or the German SS troopers, 1n particular--became animals in those days didn't mean that I could lower myself to those standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And that was a very, very important part, or fact[or], in those days: that we had to have something to stand by and believe in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  Uh, did you interrogate these, uh, three SS men, uh, any further, or did they go off...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Uh, we just uh searched them thoroughly and, uh, made sure that they didn't have any weapons, or any--like the SS normal...very often did--have, uh, TNT inside their shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And they...at times, they would actually blow themselves up--and you with them--as you searched them. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But we, uh...we searched them thoroughly. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And then, uh, I detailed one man to take them back as prisoners and turn them over to...to our <span class="BUILDING">company headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And...and thus back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">But they were marked as war crimes, as were the German women guards at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> uh, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Uh, now, we really didn't understand what would happen to them from that point on. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Except that they would...we hoped, would draw more attention than the other prisoners would, uh, that we would turn back to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  At that point, did you run into other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or other...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Then we continued on that particular day, as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And now we had learned, uh... In fact, we had overrun the column that had gone out the back side of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I believe--and...and I'm assuming--uh, uh, but through certain other facts, that in this particular column was Dov Shelanski (ph), who eventually became the Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Uh, I do understand, uh, that he was in this column being taken away and that the Germans were killing the prisoners as fast as they could while they were taking them back away from our <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Now, we had cut through and cut them off and...uh ...the men, as I can remember at this particular column, they uh... the men were coming down out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and seeing and hearing the Germans shooting the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And perhaps...and they were bayoneting them, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I believe they shot everyone of those guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">They didn't give them a chance to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">But then they relieved these prisoners that were coming out of the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Now, we moved on; and we were coming to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> not very far away, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="896">The quick, uh, history of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> that it was designed as a Stalag [NB: Prisoner of War camp] for the airmen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And they were normally treated rather quite well during the war, until this period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was designed for 3,000 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Now, as we overran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp, [</span> it] held over 30,000 prisoners 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Instead of having just airmen, prisoners from the Allies--that would be the Canadians, English, and the Americans--they now held a lot of Jews that had been taken away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">master camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , uh, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">2 were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">There were many of our own men [NB: from the US 394th Infantry Regiment], that were captured during the Battle of the Bulge, uh, were brought down on forced march. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And they knew they didn't have a chance, apparently, to go by and go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So they detoured them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">At this point, we had....because of Dachau 3B, we knew that what the Germans were doing...that they were taking prisoners out the <span class="DLF">back gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">So our battalion that night made a "pincer movement"--as the Germans called it--attacked heavily, and one point broke through the <span class="DLF">German line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We came in during the night, behind the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">In front, the armored uh...uh, battalion that was attached to us came in at the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I understand that they had a bit of fight to begin with; and then they broke in and blew their way in the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and came in the <span class="DLF">front gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Uh, then...uh, I and my men were given, shall we say, a little bit of a reprieve and told to come in the <span class="DLF">back gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And we started finding some of our own buddies, that had been captured during the Bulge, in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Uh, which was an incredible thing; because at this stage of the war and everything else, whether on purpose or design.... Uh, but all these men were horribly starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">These were American soldiers, Jews...as I say, there were other Europeans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They were many... The... And we noticed distinctly that the British, Canadians, American airmen that were there were in much better physical condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">They were much better treated, whether by...by design or...or events, uh, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">The American soldier from the 99th Division, the 106th and the 28th Division that were brought in, in these columns were in horrible condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And, uh, of course, as I say, we got a chance to talk with some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I remember so distinctly some of the men talking to me excitedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And they said, "Do you remember when we were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Maxey</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , and two orders were--when we were declared hot...."" In other words, the outfit was fit for combat, and we were now going *! </span><span class="sentence" id="920">There has been no Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> by this name since 1948. * </span><span class="sentence" id="921">According to US military records, this would have happened around April 29 or April 30, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">°° Officially designated by the Nazis as Stalag VIIA. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">to go to Europe in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Two orders came down from the higher command. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Number one, that all men with tattoos would have their tattoos removed at their cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">No reason given for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Now we had gone through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , we knew why. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But obviously, the American Army knew long time before what was happening to prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Number two, all men in the line companies--now, roughly speaking, half the infantry, uh, divisions are behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> as intelligence, as supply, artillery, and all this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But the linemen were the men who were going to actually do the fighting, were in the line companies, [and] all had to be circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I understand the 106th Division, which was formed about the same time we were, was treated the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Now, these men were describing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg</span> what happened. "...</span><span class="sentence" id="933">that you remember back there, when we were circumcised?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="934">Yes, I remember." </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Now, when they were captured during the Battle of the Bulge and the Germans began examining them, they found these men circumcised--at the same period of time that the Germans are hunting all over Europe for the Jew, the only men in Europe at that time that were circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And here they had black men. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They had Indians. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">They had Mexicans. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And they had all the different religious men were circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And I would assume that they were probably dumbfounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">But they separated them from the other Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">The Black men, almost immediately as soon as they captured them, they took them aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And we're finding out now they piano wired their wrists behind them; and then they began to bayonet them, sticking the bayonets up under their throat here, through their privates, and through other parts of their bodies first, before they finally ran them through and killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And they left them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  These were soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  These were American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Black men. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Uh, I have now been asking an awful lot of the ex-POWs the same question. "</span><span class="sentence" id="949">Have you, while you were an American soldier...prisoner of the Germans, did you--on the force marches, the death marches, or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> --ever see any American Black soldiers?" </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And every one of them, at this point now--and I'm getting an awful lot of letters in--every one of them answered me, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="951">They've never seen a Black prisoner back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">In the columns, as they were captured and taken back to behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> during the Bulge, the SS troopers who--most of them could speak English-- began ordering the prisoners to expose their dog tags. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So the American took the dog tags out, [and] hung them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Immediately, the Germans started...uh, the SS trooper started going down, uh, the prisoners, looking at their dog tags. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Your name 1s on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">There is a letter designat...on the top, designating your blood type; and on the bottom, there is a letter designating your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Every man with a letter H--"Hebrew"--was immediately pushed aside, and their heads were blown off right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They were also looking for the man of German descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Apparently, the Germans resented that they didn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and join the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">But immediately in the columns, as I understand now from these men, they realized what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">They began--the Indians, the Mexicans, the men of dark skin--began swapping dog tags with the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Other men, uh, Catholics and Protestant, began passing up their Bibles to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And thus, they could...many of them bluffed their way through. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Uh, very close friend of mine--George Golman, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> --uh, still had... Last year, when he called me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , and he told me: he says, "Whitey," he says, "you know, I still have that Bible that saved my life." </span><span class="sentence" id="965">He said, "When the SS trooper came for me, he started to reach out for the dogtag. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And I started telling him that I was a Catholic." </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And he says, "I can recite anything in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">You open the page, and I'll recite it to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And he bluffed his way; uh, and the SS trooper moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And thus this...these tactics saved a lot...a lot of these men's lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">It was an incredible facts that are coming out now, of what happened to those men. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Now, I find with, uh, a lot of these men are telling me that as they...those who survived the marches--where they were brutalized, beaten, some shot, uh, a great many of them horribly starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">They picked up many of the diseases en route; and, of course, especially dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Many of them probably died of dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">But those who survived to get to the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps--</span> such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hammelburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Uh, it's a key camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">As the survivors got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they were detailed so many men to a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And this is a Stalag, now--for POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And these men then were...went into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and were assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Immediately, in came a group of German soldiers to each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ; and commanded that the "Jew boys" step forward, is the way the termed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">The prisoners 1n there began yelling out, calling out to the men: "Don't do it! </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Don't do it!" </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Unfortunately, some of the Jews stepped forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">These are American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And they were immediately taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Now, others did not step forward and, uh, declare themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">The men who declared themselves as Jews were immediately taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">They were never seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Over and over again, the other prisoners keep telling me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Now, along came a letter from another man--uh, McCracken, his name 1s-- and he was in the regimental, uh, medics. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And he said he was among the men who liberated that camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hammelburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">He began exploring, after the excitement was all over; and he went into one particular <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and down into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And here he found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , as he declares, as a <span class="INT_SPACE">execution room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">One whole <span class="DLF">wall</span> covered with lead and bullet marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">At the base of the, uh, <span class="DLF">wall</span> 1s a <span class="DLF">trench</span> , to carry the blood, and a <span class="DLF">drainhole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">We're trying to investigate much deeper into these facts, uh, as we go along now. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But all these little facts are starting to come out, and put a much better picture of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But it was, uh, very strange to find an <span class="INT_SPACE">execution chamber</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalag</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">QUESTION:  So, uh, from your, uh... After you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , uh...which was...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">QUESTION:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moosburg camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">What happened after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Did you...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">We then moved on out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> leaving the prisoners behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Uh, and then we were heading toward a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landshut</span> , not very far from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And, uh, here there was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Uh, it was in our minds not significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">It wasn't a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">horror camp</span> --at least, as much as I know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Uh, this camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landshut</span> , uh, contained, uh, I believe, almost all English and Canadian, uh, troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Uh, they had already been liberated at this point, as we were marching through; and a lot of the prisoners were coming out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And they, of course, waving to you as...as normal, and uh, even saluting us, and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And it was, uh, a stage of glory, should we say, and happiness at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And we continued on by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, and we began... Now, this was on the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And we that night, uh, took over some <span class="BUILDING">farm houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And then, uh, Captain Pat called me, uh, to his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> --that <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> he was in--and he told me... Now, he assigned me that I was gonna, uh, take a patrol into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And this patrol, he says, "I'm gonna ask you to volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Uh, and your men." </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Uh, he gave me the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">As best as I can remember now, uh, that I'm being assigned three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> with rubber tracks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I'm to take my men on the top of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , to protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">We're to hit the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> , uh, during the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I believe that was about, probably, two o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And break through; not fight unless we had to, but keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Just fight our way through, and go behind the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Keep on going down this particular <span class="DLF">road</span> for approximately 30, 35 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And down in there somewhere was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that I was to try to take and stop the Germans from blowing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">That was my basic mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Thus, we did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And as I believe to this day, uh, that, uh, a famous cartoonist--now I can't think of his name...uh, Bill Mauldin--uh, was standing in the background, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And he came up; and he asked me...he asked Captain Pat if he could go on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And Captain told him, he says, "Well, that's not my decision." </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">He says, "You'll have to ask Sargeant Whiteway." </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And I looked at him, and I said, "Well, you understand, this is apparently a suicide patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">That we're not going to get any help for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I cannot protect you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">You are a civilian, technically;

and the Germans there blew the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> up in our faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So now the mission was blown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Uh, the only thing I could do, there was a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> --an <span class="DLF">opening</span> , a little small <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And I told the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , I says, "Okay, pull in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">We'll make a big circle around you and dig in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And you guys dig the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> in the middle of that." </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Now, the Germans were coming in from all directions; and they totally surrounded us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And we could see them put a <span class="DLF">blockade</span> up, uh, on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , so we couldn't escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And we were sweat...began to sweat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">We stayed there for countless hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And everybody's asking me, "What the heck are they doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I said, "The only thing I can think of..." And, of course, at times I was communicating with the tankers, who radioed back our condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Uh, that the Germans were waiting to bring in "<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Tiger" tanks</span> to blow our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And we had no defense against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">But we waited and waited; and finally, we could hear way down the valley an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">They have a very distinct sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And he was winding his way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And so we kept looking there, and finally we could see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And we started yelling to him to go back, go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">He approached the, uh...the <span class="DLF">blockade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">The Germans opened up the <span class="DLF">blockade</span> and let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We couldn't understand what the heck was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And then the two guys in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> drove right up to us through the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> ; and they yelled out, "It's all over! </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">It's the end of the war!"~" *“ Th the <span class="REGION">European theatre</span> , the war ended May 9, 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">QUESTION:  While you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> , did you also run into some prisoners of war there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">ANSWER:  Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">After the war, and on our...so-called "on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ," uh, for discharge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And we took over; and we were assigned occupation, temporarily, uh, in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And we had 200,000 German prisoners there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And at times, uh, we would go up, uh, between--when we were off-duty, and so on--uh, on patrol, we would go up and we'd watch the Germans playing European football. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">As today, we call it soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And they were very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">But, of course, they had nothing else to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So uh, they'd be out there playing; and then they come over talking to us, uh...uh, at the end of their games, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And, uh, they could...uh, some of them could speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Some could speak some English, and visa versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We was already learned a certain amount of German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So we could communicate quite easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I...there was a colonel, a German officer, standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And I questioned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I said, "You know, I'm very puzzled about one thing." </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I said, "Everywhere I've gone in Europe here, during the war and after the war, that I can find no young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , over in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , there's no young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">What happened to them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And the colonel stood erect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And he said, "Well, we officers--or we Germans--occupying these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">That we knew that there would be one group that would most resent what we were going to do to the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That was the young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So as we overran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , we immediately rounded up all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And we separated all the young men from 16...or 15 or 16 to 25, stand over there against a <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">We set up firing squads, and we immediately shot everyone of them, in every living <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we went into. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Voila! </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">No problem."

QUESTION:  Shocking!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  Very shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Uh... But then I began to understand the German mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Of course, there were many other things that came out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Of their attitudes of the German occupation of these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and so on; and their intimidation and their firing squads, and why, are there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  In all your experience that you've already described to us, what were your feelings? </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">What...what would you like to say about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Of course, uh, after, uh...at the very end of the war there, we did overrun--right somewhere in that immediate vicinity--and only saw part of one of the Mauthausens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">There was 42, as I understand now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And we saw some awful horrors there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And even, uh, cannibalism in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">But these... Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And we were so shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And Professor Crawford asked me after the war, he said... Now, he asked me the same question about my emotions, how I felt...thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And he asked me another question, "Did you men during the war--after you left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or after the war, or even at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --talk about these terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and these horrors that you saw?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And I suddenly realized, number one, that all this time I had been assuming that as we radioed--like, for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> --that we radioed back constantly all the things that we were finding to the company; to be reported, we assumed, on the, uh, daily reports of the military, that here they, uh...all the reports itself would be turned in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">But I also assumed that due to us communicating with the men behind us, that all of a sudden everybody in the battalion would be coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and taking a look at all these horrors that we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">It didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Nobody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And we were ordered out, to go help the battalion fight for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I found out since that somebody in the division has deleted every single word of every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that we had entered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Every single word had been disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Nobody seemed to care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Of the human misery, or anything else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And this shocked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">But at the end of the war--without even knowing about this, but just assuming that everybody else around me and the company had gone in--it was so distasteful to remember this that we tried to shut it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">We did not ever talk amongst each other about one single word about any of these things that happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">From the shock, from all the human misery, uh, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ....the misery among ourselves, the misery about all the Germans that we shot and left wounded on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , crying and begging...uh, to the German civilians who were bombed and fire-bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">It was total misery all the time we were over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">So, by the end of the war, we became very, very bitter men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And it took us a long time to come out of this bitterness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Of the human misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Not so much, uh, because of the war and what the Germans did, but the...all the misery that we had seen, of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Uh, those are terrible, terrible memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And for 40 years, approximately, I buried all those memories in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">When I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I remember trying to tell some of the adventures, some of the things that happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And everybody--my friends, my family--the minute you'd start talking about the war at all, they'd say, "Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">It's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">We don't want to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">We don't care." </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And this... And I actually was even humiliated. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">You were in the big one!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And becoming embarrassed or humiliated like that, that you'd bottle the things up even deeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So finally when Professor Crawford approached me the first time, and I began to remember some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">When I first started to testify and talk about it, even for the first few years, I could only remember just so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And it was all kind of jumbled, and locations were jumbled in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">After a while, all of a sudden, things started to straighten out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">But I have not had a nightmare since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And that's a very big point, uh, there.</span></p>
