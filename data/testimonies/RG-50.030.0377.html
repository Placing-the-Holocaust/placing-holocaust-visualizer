<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I'd like you to begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  And then continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  If you would.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My name is Steve Galezewski. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born May 11th, 1923 in the Town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> in <span class="REGION">northwest Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">The reason why I am talking today is Iam a Pole who was born in a generation, the only generation really, in free Poland. </span><span class="sentence" id="6"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1918, and then was, of course, was attacked in 1939 by Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Being brought up in the climate of freedom, I probably am a little bit more patriotic than the Poles who were raised in the periods after the Second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">In my childhood, I was very involved, as well as my father, in the Boy Scout movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">This is the reason why my father was arrested and eventually killed by gestapo, because he was a leader of the youth in the Town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My childhood was a very happy childhood until the year 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">At that time, I was 16 years old, and almost, I could say, that at time I had to put the uniform and start my war days. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So you can see that I missed all the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> proms and the fun most of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids have in their last days of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">On September 1 ...
QUESTION:  Could I just ask you to talk a little bit more about what life was like in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and whether or not you had Jewish friends ...
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Well, let's erase the last sentence I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">In the Town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> , the Jewish population was not very numerous like in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">However, there was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with the <span class="DLF">roof</span> which we thought was gold, gold-leafed roof. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">One of the better <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">In my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I did have a class of some 25, 30 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I had two Jewish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I remember their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">One was Smalish (ph) and the other one was Zowagazski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Two different people. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Smalish was not very athletic. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He was more or less a sedentary type. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The other one, Zowagazski, was involved with us in all the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities like soccer, basketball, and he quite often visited my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so I was fairly close to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I wish today I knew whether they still alive or what happened to either one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">When the Germans actually came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> , I don't recall any activity against the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I don't remember, because most probably they had moved away from the German Army as the German Army came tn. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The war started for us, the Second World War started for us September 1, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Two, three days before the -- and I should probably also say that I was brought up 1n a soldier's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father was a professional soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And two, three days before his regiment, which was the 59th Infantry Regiment, moved to the <span class="DLF">defense line</span> on the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , he called me and gave me a pistol, which was a Walther 7.65 millimeters and had a talk with me man-to-man. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And said, "Look, I am leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I don't know when I will be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">You are the oldest boy out of three of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">You will assume the role of the head of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I want you to take good care of your mother and two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And then, of course, he went to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Already after the war ended, I learned a lot of things which happens to him during that war. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">For instance, he was in the Battle of Kura, which was one of the fiercest battles fought during that campaign. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And when the entire army was surrounded by German panzer divisions near that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Kura</span> , they were already after three days of fighting without ammunition, without support of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And casualties were extremely heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Commanding officer of the regiment, according to the write-ups in the newspapers, called my father and asked him to preserve the regimental flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Regimental flag for a Polish soldier is something very sacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Still today, when I see an American flag, for instance, not necessarily Polish, something grabs my heart, and I am ready to take the hat off my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That's part of the upbringing I grew in. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He, according to the versions in the newspapers and accounts of those who survived the prisoner-of-war camp, he apparently broke through the encirclement of Germans and buried the flag in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Of course, he subsequently in 1940 was arrested by gestapo, that's the last time we saw him, and nobody knew where the flag was. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In 1985, someone with a metal detector was going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and detected that there was something buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They dug it out and it was a backpack and in that backpack was the regimental flag, half destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was restored and is today flying proudly in the Army Museum in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">When father -- when the father was arrested -- this is something which really sticks in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Because the gestapo came in early in the morning, he was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they said, "You sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We wait for him here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And we waited until he got back from work at 5 o'clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">To me, it was a horrible because I wanted to warn him and yet, here were the gestapo bandits with a woman and three young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I couldn't do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Father was accused of trying to break away that region of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Germans already considered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span> , that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , as their <span class="REGION">territory</span> , and really, that's why the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Because they wanted a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> and to <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , of course, refused to buckle under this trap, and that's how the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">After arrest of father, we were given 15 minutes to pack belongings and were taken out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> , where we were for about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">After that, we were put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> and shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verdun</span> , out of what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> considered - what Germans considered <span class="REGION">German territory</span> and were taken to the <span class="REGION">Warsaw region</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> (ph), the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> were opened and we were let out to start a new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  ... a few questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You've mentioned that you had Jewish personal friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Were you aware of a general climate of anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Well, occasionally in the newspaper, you would read that a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shop</span> was demolished, and that something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But not in the region of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where I come from, that's only from the newspaper I learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  But was it something that other boys talked about ...
ANSWER:  No, that was never really discussed, because to us, a human being was a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Whether you are Jewish or -- well, frankly, they were Polish citizens anyway, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So to ask, there was no difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  I'm also curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Before September '39, what you knew about the activities of the Nazi Party ...
ANSWER:  Well, that's -- again, we knew that inevitably something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That's why in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> our army was mobilized and we were somewhat prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">To the extent that, for instance, my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> made donations from all the students, and we purchased a heavy machine gun for the 59th Regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It wasn't like you have here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where you have millions of dollars for armament. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Out there we had to scratch everything we could to arm ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">From my generation, there were some very heroic moves. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We didn't have very many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , for instance, but we had what we called live torpedoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I was so proud of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> help, because she volunteered, 18-year-old girl who was helping my mother in <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , she volunteered as a live torpedo. </span><span class="sentence" id="82"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of course, we knew that was fully armed, was belligerent and that the trouble will come from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Also, their treatment of Jews was giving us indication what will happen if they ever show up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">As a matter of fact, somewhere from 1936, if I'm not wrong, we opened up pretty much for the Jewish people escaping from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or trying to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We opened up the <span class="DLF">Polish borders</span> and let quite a few of them into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I'm pretty sure that they -- except for the incidents of anti-Semitism here and there, I'm pretty sure that felt at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for 30 million population, we had some 3 million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So this was a very big percentage. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I don't know how many millions of Jews are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but I'm pretty sure not much more than 3 million or maybe even less. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We being prepared for a war somewhat, in Boy Scouts on all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to which we went in 1939, we were trying to make them on the Polish/<span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And during our campfires, we, of course, sung the Boy Scouts' songs, patriotic songs, always trying to warn Hitler not to try us -- not to try because we would not behave like the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> behaved when Hitler invaded them. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We wanted him to know that we will fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That fight came in finally on September 1, 1939, when 5 o'clock in the morning 21 Heinkels, 88 Stukas bombed the open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">This is the first time I saw dead bodies, not only of horses and animals, but of human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Up to that moment, I didn't ever even go to a funeral, so this was for me a very traumatic day. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I also when I think about that day, I almost have to laugh at myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Because the 7.65 millimeter pistol my father me, I was trying to shoot down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving bombers</span> , and, of course, it's a laughable thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It would be just like a fly going with an elephant. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The families of military personnel were being evacuated on the fifth day of war, and I decided, although father designated me as the head of family, I decided to designate my younger brother and join the fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So I gave the pistol to my brother, who was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Gave him the same talk father gave me, and very promptly lied my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I was 16, I had to say I was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I joined the 59th Regiment, that 1s the unit which was being organized in the back of the fighting unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Went through most of the fights on the <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovel</span> '. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The humiliation of the villagers and population was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They were simply machine-gunning women and children, bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> which had nothing to do with the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">In the <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> where we got near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovel</span> ', Ukrainians started their own fight and started burning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> , and started burning and killing Jews and Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">No wonder that later on, Germans were able to organize SS Militia Division out of the Ukrainians and use them as guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The war was over basically in October 2nd, 1939, and I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in about November. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Didn't get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Most of the Polish Army, of course, either crossed through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and eventually reorganized in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ; or shed their uniforms with civilian clothing and returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , mother and my brothers were already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Thank God they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Father came in later. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He also, after saving the flag, returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> 1n civilian clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Of course, he did not talk about the flag at all, so I was unaware what was going on in that particular thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">When I was asked by the historians, I couldn't contribute much on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Was he angry that you hadn't followed his directions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Actually, we were all happy that everything finished and we were still together. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Then, of course, after he was arrested and we were transported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> , we started a new chapter 1n our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  I just wanted to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You mentioned that you and your family was put in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for a few months or ...
ANSWER:  A couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  ... a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Who all was in there with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  All the people like us who did not want to become . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">In that <span class="REGION">area</span> , Germans considered that <span class="REGION">territory</span> German, and they gave people an option to sign a German list. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Yes, I am a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we considered ourselves Poles, and we did not want to become Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So all those people were simply taken out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and transported to what they considered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  And the Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  I don't recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I don't recall specifically seeing Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  What happened at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  This was a camp from which you either landed eventually <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> or some other big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or like in our case, being transported to the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , move them away from the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We were called displaced persons, DPs as they called them, they called us after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Do you remember exactly what your family thought about what was going on, why you were being moved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Well, father, of course, was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">With mother, talking about things of that was -- well, it was not normal to talk to mother about things men talked about, let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It doesn't mean that women were not treated equally in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , by any chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Were you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  No, at that age and from what I already went through, I wasn't frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Frankly, I wanted to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I wanted to revenge what they have done up to now from what I have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And remember one thing, that I was born in free <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I was brought as a free Pole, and I couldn't stand, for instance, things we were required in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Like at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> or to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> or to a <span class="DLF">park</span> where children play, a sign, "For Poles, Jews and dogs, <span class="DLF">entrance</span> forbidden.” </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Or when I see a German walking on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , I'm supposed to step into the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> , take my hat off, bow, and stay in that position until he moves away three paces from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Those were not things compatible with freedom I enjoyed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Therefore, I was looking for a source where I could arm myself and fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I thought about crossing the <span class="DLF">border</span> and getting to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where Polish troops were being organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Somehow that didn't happen, because when they let us out of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> , we had absolutely no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We had absolutely no time to take anything from our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , jewelry or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We were simply taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And incidentally, into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they put Germans whom they transferred from like where they are to other regions. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So in one minute, you lost your entire life's assets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  What was the ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  That was like April, May 1940 -- I'm sorry, '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Not so sure, not so sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It's '40, '41, somewhere there. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">One thing I should also mention, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> , incidentally, they burned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But first, they took the golden leaves off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Who else would have been ? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Did they prevent you from going into <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> or ...
ANSWER:  There were absolutely no <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> beyond the sixth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Germans considered us a race which was supposed to be eliminated after they eliminated the Jewish race. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We were the number two in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And, therefore, they said they don't have to be educated beyond the simple reading and arithmetics. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Therefore, no <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Of course, immediately the underground <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> sprang up, and the former teachers, you know, they were meeting in groups of four, five, ten private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and continuing the studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="169"><span class="BUILDING">Universities</span> , of course, were nonexistent for Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> , I was a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I didn't know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It took some time before I started to know who is who. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I have joined, of course, first thing, the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- underground high school where I continued my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Out there among the boys, I found my first contact on the fighting underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Let me change the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Well, that was among these students in this <span class="BUILDING">underground high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And after a while, I was asked to join an underground organization, fighting organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I was worn in; of course, I have to be certain that I was swearing the obedience to the right people and fortunately I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Because this was the Polish government under the allies, which was at the time located in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I won't say much about the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , but I will mention one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">That my last year in that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the principal came in to me and said, "Look, you are in endangering the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We will give you your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You don't have to attend any more of the classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We know you are engaged in the underground activities.” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And he did that to a couple of other boys from my group, so we basically did not finish the actual, listening to actual lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But we got the graduation on the merit of what we had done up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And that was, of course, the second year. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I was in this almost 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The beginning, my beginning in -- also, general life conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk- Suwatki</span> at that time -- in 1940 when we arrived there, I think it was late 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The Jews already had to wear the Star of David on the arm band, but they were not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They lived in their own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> like they did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And I think late in 1940, I remember, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">This was a very unique <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because no wires or no <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> were put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But they simply designated four main <span class="DLF">streets</span> as the boundaries of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Of course, the order of the day was that any Jew who was found outside of that was shot on the spot, and that happened quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I didn't see, personally, myself the shooting, but I've seen the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Something happened maybe 15 minutes I arrived at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I think was fairly loose and a lot of Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> , I think managed to mingle with Poles and get away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , according to various villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And farmers, of course, it depends again on the personality of the farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Quite for money, quite often for humanitarian reasons, they would hide and save the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">This was very dangerous for Poles because anytime you helped a Jew by giving him bread or milk or whatever, food or sheltering, you endangered your entire family and your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">It happened many, many times where a neighbor who didn't like his neighbor said, "Hey, my neighbor yesterday gave something to the Jews who came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Well, that entire family was wiped out, and their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And the news all around was arriving, this happened 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ; this happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So population, Polish population basically was very frightened and very careful on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">This probably could be the reason why it was universally practiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">On the other hand, AK, which is the underground organization to which I belonged, and that means -- AK means Army Krajowa, which is home army. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Had very specific orders to assist and help as much as possible by absorbing young Jews who were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and wanted to join the guerrillas, they were welcomed with open arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">As a matter of fact, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , we had an example of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">In my combat organization, Mr. Harter, who belongs to veteran's organization, veteran guerilla organization, was saved by Poles and survived the war by being in the guerilla unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I heard of many, many instances of the same thing happening, but this is my personal involvement with Mr. Harter. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">My beginning in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> was simply what they call small sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We were putting placards on <span class="DLF">streets</span> , anti-German, trying to change their morale, which at the time at the beginning, 1940, '41, was still pretty high. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But we were trying to pass some messages to them by graffiti type, by placards, by all possible means that the war, the fighting is a hopeless war. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They're not going to win. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">After a few months, I graduated from this small sabotage into the real fighting unit where we were, for instance, protecting the parachute drops from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We also were protecting on other occasions the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> which was communicating with the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">In 1941 there were still very few actual attacks on German compounds, but in 1942 the speed of the military involvement increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And in that I took part, and oh, in 1942 in blowing up two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">In 1943, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ammunition train</span> , we blew up and also took materials to support ourselves from various <span class="BUILDING">industrial complexes</span> like a <span class="BUILDING">chocolate factory</span> where we took tons and tons of sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We loaded them on the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> the peasants supplied. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And then sold that for money to support the guerilla activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Blew up a <span class="BUILDING">vodka distillery</span> , other smaller activities wherein the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> -- in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , Germans said you have to deliver so many horses, so many cows, so many tons of grain or potatoes for the Germany effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And usually, there were designated people who were responsible for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And those people knowing that they're working and they can be banished for it, they were very eager. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We tried to dampen their enthusiasm and warn them not to do it in a too eager way. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">If someone like that didn't listen to us, next time we took him and publicly in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , let's say, 50 lashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We also watched women, that they wouldn't go with German soldiers or German civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">If that happened and she didn't get the warning and continued, a unit would go shave her head to zero and put a finger on her that she was a prostitute. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Smaller other things, and usually the boys 12, 13, girls even were involved 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">In the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> , there would be a German with a Polish prostitute in the mink coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Well, they would have the spray bottle with the strong acid, and very quietly would spray that acid on the fur coat of the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">By the time the girl was leaving the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> , the fur coat was almost falling off her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Those were the expressions of resistance from the youngest all the way up. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We tried to liberate our prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We attacked several <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and liberated quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">What Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , however, for every German killed, they tried to wipe out 25, 50 Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And what they would usually do, they would put a sign on all the visible <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that today or yesterday a German soldier was attacked and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">For that 50 Poles tomorrow will be executed, although they were listed as possible people to go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So the terror was unbelievable, but by the year 1942, '43, we realized that if we were doing nothing as we were in 1940, let's say, the underground, we were dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We were being hanged on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were full of Poles, not only Jews, but Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Of course, those Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were Poles anyway, so there's no distinction there. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish located camps</span> , Germans, of course, brought Jews from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">From that you can see what the situation was developing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So we finally decided, hey, if we have to die, we might as well die taking some of them with us, and that's where this pace of resistance accelerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And that's where more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went up, more <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">More attacks on the <span class="DLF">airfields</span> and other military objectives happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">By 1942, I think it's July 1942, in July 1942 out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I think they have taken some 220 people and in one day shot them at the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , at the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Now, I have not witnessed that, but 1t was universally known. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">On August 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk ghetto</span> was liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">What happened is the Germans, Latvians, Ukrainians with the assistance of the Jewish police, rounded all inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">A few thousand people were in that <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , and they didn't know what is going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They stayed there overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Some were trying to escape, and they were, of course, shot during the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Next day in a column -- they formed the columns and all the inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were marched into the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where numerous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> were waiting for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They were loaded with the help again of Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">The Jewish police, although not armed, they had baseball bats, all of them, and special hats and special arm bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">During that transport and during the gathering of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , the word was that about 1,000 of the Jews were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went, I'm not sure whether they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or some other camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I have witnessed the march from a <span class="DLF">window</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to which they were going, I have witnessed the march of the Jews to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I have not seen personally anyone killed, because the <span class="REGION">region</span> where I was was rather short visible from the <span class="DLF">window</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">But I could hear the shots, and then the word came in the next day and the following day among Poles that about 1,000 were shot during that incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So this was the finish and annihilation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There were, of course, 500 craftsmen -- tailors, shoemakers, people who were taken out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> before, and they were housed in the Copernicus (ph) School, and they were working for the German Army, working on the German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Working on producing shoes, doing things which were useful for the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">From that group, sometimes in 1943, '42, '43, some 200 were taken and shot again in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The remaining 300 plus stayed and continued to work for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">On January 6th, which happens to be a Polish Catholic holiday, that's why I remember the date, was the annihilation of the rest of the Jews from the <span class="BUILDING">Copernicus School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">How did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And that I personally witnessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">At that time I had the documents on my own name; however, they were documents very strong which I received from the <span class="DLF">underground channels</span> , underground help. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was a fireman in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> where several of us from the underground were employed for the simple reason that those documents allowed us to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> after the curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Curfew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was like 7 o'clock, and after 7 o'clock, no Jew, no Pole could be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Only Germans were allowed to be after curfew on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So with those documents, of course, we could go on our underground activities, gather for the job to be done somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">That very morning on the 6th of January, we noticed shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> we see a lot of smoke coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Being, of course, a fire brigade in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , our concern was supposed to be a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but we decided to go and see if we can help and put the fire out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So we all put the helmets on, jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and went toward the smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Well, the smoke was coming in from the <span class="BUILDING">Copernicus School</span> where the remnants of the Jewish population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> were housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">On arrival, the entire <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was in flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The <span class="DLF">roof</span> was on the verge of collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Outside one could see uniformed Latvians, Germans, Sicherheitspolizei, and Polish police shooting at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and generally trying to finish whoever was trying to get out of the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I could see two piles of bodies some six, seven feet high, piled up next to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I could see on the ledges of <span class="DLF">windows</span> half-burned bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I could a mother with a little child trying to throw the child out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> when someone shot her and killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The thing which stayed with me for many, many, many years after the war, however, was an incident which happened a few steps from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">A gendarme, a German six-foot plus tall, because I am six foot so I can judge the height, some 250 pounds heavy takes a little Jewish girl by the hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Leads her to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , sits her by that <span class="DLF">wall</span> , corrects her posture even. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Moves back a few steps and shoots her right in the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Now, at a moment like that, one is ready, of course, to jump and do something, but what could one do? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I could only pay back for happenings like that through my underground activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Because anything on the spot out there would have meant death to all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I did not want this to be forgotten in case they do not have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> any records of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk- Suwatki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Two often one hears the Holocaust never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Well, here is one eyewitness who saw what was going on and what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Where the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> were taken, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Whether this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , whether this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but usually those three were the main sources of gathering the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish ghettos</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Frankly, we didn't hear much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Although I tell you one thing from reading after the war, we had a courier from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who 1s still alive, still lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Who went from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and reported to allies and to Roosevelt and Churchill what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Because Germans were trying to say nothing is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Well, so the Jewish population in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> through that should have known what is happening to their brothers and sisters in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And yet, to my disappointment, they didn't do enough to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  I was curious how and where you were at that time .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  No, you were not aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Your movements were so limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">You were not supposed to move from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so the people who were aware that there was something going on were only the people who lived close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">In 1943, of course, as I said, the pace of the underground activities accelerated considerably, and also in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The defeat of German was very apparent in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">One could see the things they had to do to sustain their fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">For instance, an order would come in like winter 1943 to all the Polish women. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Any fur coat you have you have to deliver to a pickup point. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So they picked up all the fur coats any woman had in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The next few months, you could see the Germans coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> wearing women's fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The winter was hitting them so badly in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , they were not prepared for it, that they had to be in Polish ladies’ fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Underground was prepared to the point that when the defeat of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was apparent and before the Soviets moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , liberate ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">There were at that time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> some 300,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">When that day came in, when the Soviet troops moved on the territory of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the Warsaw uprising started on August 1, 1944- and incidentally, when I talk about Warsaw uprising, I'm talking about the Polish uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">There was a Jewish uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> several months before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It didn't last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Resistance was not very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Polish underground tried to help by delivering to the <span class="DLF">underground channel</span> through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> a lot of arms to the fighters in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But those few who were fighting were eliminated and that was liquidated totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  You know, I'm not sure whether something 1s -- we're starting a new tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It might -- I wanted to learn a little bit more some of the specific risks you undertook in some of your underground activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I also want to ask you questions about general underground organization, but wherever you want to start.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Well, let's first talk about the organization of underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">In the early days of war, that means 1939, '40, there were multitudes of organizations, underground organizations, all eager to fight Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They ranged from the extreme left to the extreme right. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">In the extreme right, you had what probably what gave the rest of us the anti-Semitic, how you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The anti-Semitic, I'm fighting for a name, image. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Those were the extreme right organization, Knesset, Natrilova Shevis Brenner (ph), where they considered that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is only for Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They were as close to the Nazi thinking that one could go, but they were soldiers; they were fighters, and they were supported from the West probably more than we were from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Some of them when order came to consolidate all the fighting units, some of them didn't join and stayed separate, like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knesset</span> (ph) . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Most of the unit except the branches of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knesset</span> and except the Communists, Army , which were run by Stalin, by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , joined together. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And from that Army Krajowa emerged. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Army Krajowa in 1943, '43, one could consider entire nation in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It had all kinds of functions like medical/sanitary functions all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It had underground court system all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">It was run from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There was one head man, general, who was the head man of the Armia Krajowa, but in each <span class="REGION">region</span> -- and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided into several <span class="REGION">regions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Like my <span class="REGION">region</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> , was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varangia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">That's a <span class="REGION">region</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">In each one of those <span class="REGION">regions</span> , there were subdivisions where a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> would have an Ob Vood. </span><span class="sentence" id="350"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ob Vood</span> was still subdivided into what they call platsuski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="351">That was the smallest possible underground unit, platsuski, which consisted usually of one or two platoons of the local peasant, local soldiers, who would train on weekends when they didn't work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They would go and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at night in the art of military fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There was a system of <span class="BUILDING">military schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">For instance, I am a graduate of the underground military officers' school, which I took for several months in 1942, '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">During that period, for instance, that gives you an idea to what extent we went during those several months, there were numerous instances where we fired live ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Where we spent nights and nights in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> learning the survival techniques. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Occasionally, on something like that there would be an action where you would blow up a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">During the -- the atm was so well specified that in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , the military objectives in case the uprising, they're already designated for individual units, for individual platoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">To give you an example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> there is a <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">That's a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which is three stories high. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">That three-story high building has only one <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , so guards were put out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You know, they pretty well controlled entry to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Well, each <span class="DLF">window</span> had a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We had <span class="DLF">ladders</span> stored for months waiting for something to happen out there where we wouldn't have to look for <span class="DLF">ladders</span> , that the <span class="DLF">ladders</span> were already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We took the <span class="DLF">ladders</span> and attacked them from <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , rather than through the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It was so well thought through, so well organized, that it's incomprehensible sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Numerous -- for instance, I took part in a liberation of a prisoner who was caught by gestapo, was tortured and we were afraid he might break. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We went -- and they kept him since he ...
QUESTION:  ... Okay, you were trying to ... this prisoner who you thought might break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And incidentally, his name is Tarchinski (ph), I remember still. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And he was after being beaten, the doctors advised gestapo that he will die if he is not taken to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So they took him to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a gendarmes or gestapo man sitting by his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Well, we went to free him in German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We entered, nobody even stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The man by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> of our comrade didn't even lift himself off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> when we entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Several, several actions were performed in such a fashion that either German uniforms or gestapo uniforms were worn. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I was myself in gestapo uniform two, three times on various actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">It's not universally known in the West, but some very, very high-ranking SS officers were executed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">One of them was the head of the gestapo for the entire <span class="REGION">eastern region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">His name was General Kuichira. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">If I remember, he was even son-in-law of Himmler. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He was executed on <span class="DLF">Warsaw street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The death sentence was given to him for his activities against Poles and Jews, and he was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So you can see that we had the -- not only the judge, but we had also the executioners in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  First of all, how was the underground economy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  This is all entire nation underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Schooling system, medical system, court system and then army. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">When the Warsaw uprising started on August 1, the so-called what we call code name Buja (ph), which is tempest. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Tempest was declared, and out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> some 300,000 underground people came out in various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and started hitting the German units. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">How the uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> started, 5 o'clock in the afternoon -- and again, every unit had objective. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">This unit was taking the powerhouse, this unit was taking <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Some other unit was taking the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> or whatever it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">On 5 o'clock, August 1, 1944, <span class="DLF">windows</span> suddenly opened and any German on the <span class="DLF">street</span> was just killed from the <span class="DLF">window</span> by people like you and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Warsaw uprising was ready and was supposed to last four, five days at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And we had enough ammunition and supplies for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">By that time it was universally assumed by all of us that there will be landings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , that Marines will be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The Polish forces, the paratroop brigades that we had, will be dropped on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Instead, what they did they took and annihilated that part of brigade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That was incidentally, under the leadership of General Sasaboski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="400">When you look at the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> "Bridge Afar," Sasaboski is mentioned and the paratroopers are mentioned 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The Warsaw uprising lasted 62 days instead of those four, five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And I would say that almost everybody was involved in that fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Civilian people were digging the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , were putting the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> on every <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Young children were used to take messages in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Kitchens were set up my housewives all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">In first days, almost entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was in our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">After those five, six days when there was no ammunition, only that ammunition we had which we took from Germans, was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Germans used some unusual techniques. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">For instance, to give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Barricaded, they cannot take. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> they use gets burned by the Molotov cocktails from <span class="DLF">windows</span> all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="413"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Tank</span> on narrow <span class="DLF">streets</span> is not a good weapon to use. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But they had armor, so the people were protected out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">As long as they stayed away from the <span class="REGION">area</span> approaching the <span class="DLF">barricade</span> , they could fire that cannon and then machine gun at will. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And we couldn't do much because all we had is the rifles and then the pistols. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">What they did in a couple of instances in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , they surrounded the wives, mothers and children, put them in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and moved them toward the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And the people behind the <span class="DLF">barricade</span> see the mother, see their sister, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">You shoot your own or you let them break your <span class="DLF">barricade</span> and make a breach into your <span class="DLF">defense line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Well, you're faced with decisions like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I won't tell you what happened in those instances, but you figure out what you would do in a case like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They also invented, I would say, what we call the Goliath. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It's a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , small one, maybe one meter long. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And they put on it half a ton, two- or three-quarter of a ton of dynamite, and this was electrically controlled and they could direct it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Here is a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which we're defending for two weeks, they cannot take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They direct that right at the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and they explode it right at the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Of course, not only this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> around go with -- just like what you've seen here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in car bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="429"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> finally fell after 62 days of furies, out of AK, some 17,000 died. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Total population loss in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was over 300,000 in 62 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">If you look at it from the perspective of Vietnam War where in some dozen years our casualties were approaching 60,000, here it would give you an idea of the ferocity of the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">In 62 days, you have over 300,000 casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> negotiated the surrender with the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The German Army was pulled from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> , was pulled from wherever they could find them to just defeat <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because that was their <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">At that time in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- and incidentally, during the negotiations the Warsaw commander negotiated with Germans that the AK guerrillas and the fighters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> will be considered under the Geneva Convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Up to that moment, they considered us bandits. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">In other words, anybody could shoot us without getting any responsibility for it, taking responsibility for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The surrender conditions were that they all will be treated under the Geneva Convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">That means they will go to the regular prisoner of war camp, and that, they lived up to that, one must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">The rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> continued fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> continued fighting and was fighting -- Soviet troops, of course, came in through treachery by inviting the Polish officers for the joint strategy sessions, the Russians invited them and those officers never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They landed all in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The troops without the officers were surrounded by Soviet troops, were disarmed and forcibly forced into a Polish Army under the Soviet command, which had an obedience to a Soviet puppet government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They created a Polish government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> consisting of some hard-nosed Polish Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I found myself in that army eventually, and in that army, incidentally, that army was being organized east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Homel'</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , and that's where my unit was stationed, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We had out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> five guards, which were put into this time, not an underground anymore, but a formal <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> found them guilty of atrocities against the Polish and Jewish population, and they were sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And the execution of the guards was performed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">My company was assigned to put a <span class="DLF">barrier</span> between the witnesses, the hundreds and thousands even of population, and the place of execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The place of execution was very simple, the gallows was put up and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in with the open back. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The guardsmen with their hands tied and their legs tied were stationed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And on command, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> moved and they simply dropped and were hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We only hanged four of them because one of them hanged himself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">In the unit, I was a company commander as a second lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That unit was training for battlefront activities, and after a few weeks, I discovered that most of the soldiers in the unit are the Polish guerrillas, AK. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Officers like me who were commanding different companies, they were also AK. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Well, we got together; we got together, and we have decided that we have to organize something within this brigade, when the allies finally show up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that we as a unit can then arrest all the Soviet officers in the unit and all the political officers in the unit and simply fully armed cross into the <span class="REGION">allied side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Well, after a few weeks, we accomplished that, and we had underground army within the Soviet Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We made contact on the commander officer of the AK for the <span class="REGION">Lublin region</span> , which was still operating. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">He was underground, he was not arrested by the Russians and gave himself under his command. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">This is probably silly to say at this point, but I will mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We made a proposal to this particular head of the underground for that <span class="REGION">region</span> that in October when there was a big parade was going to be held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And 1n that parade the entire Polish government formed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> plus Marshal Orkorsowski (ph) and some Soviet generals were supposed to on the tribune receiving the parade of all the Polish troops, which were ready to go into battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">This is October/November 1944 at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We made a proposal that we give our soldiers live ammunition for that parade, and the moment we are in front of the tribunes, we open fire at the government and show the world that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> does not want what Soviets are bringing, and that that government created by Soviets in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> means nothing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We are obeying the government inland at that time which was cooperating fully with the United States, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Well, supposedly, the message was sent to them and came back saying, "Forget about what you're proposing because Stalin would then make out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> simply a Soviet Republic like he made it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So we promptly forgot it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  I'm going to ask you stop at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">When you were talking about the hanging of the guards at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , is this the period when you and the Soviet Army liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That was already four, six weeks after. </span><span class="sentence" id="474"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> was liberated I believe in July somewhere, and this was happening July, August, September; end of September somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  Were you part of the group that went in and liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">At that time I was still in the Polish underground in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  And when you were speaking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> rising and how people were fighting all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the summer of '44, where were you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Okay, a week before the Warsaw uprising started, we pretty much knew that the end was nearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Because you could see on the major <span class="DLF">highways</span> from east to west chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It reminded us of 1939, where you could civilians, you could see German soldiers individually, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , on foot, on horseback, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicle</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">You could see that the panic was setting and that they were running from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So a week before uprising started, we went to destroy all the communications between the east and west. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">That meant all the <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span> , all the <span class="DLF">railroad lines</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I was assigned the <span class="REGION">region</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and we simply blew up the rails. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Somebody else did the telephone poles and got them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Somebody else in the different regions west -- I mean east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Then we had a concentration of our entire <span class="REGION">area</span> ordered for a certain time and certain date. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And after accomplishing our blowing up of the rails, we decided to move to the concentration point. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">At that concentration point, there was supposed to be 22nd Infantry Regiment and Brigade Calvary which is the Mazovian Calvary Brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">One of my boys said, "Well, inside of walking, how about getting a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and riding there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Well, we decided that that was not a bad idea, and took the fire engine from the <span class="BUILDING">fire station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We put our guns under the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Put the helmets on, and drove out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , not directly to the concentration point, but on the <span class="DLF">secondary roads</span> we stayed overnight in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Next day, we still stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because to get to concentration point, we had to cross the main <span class="DLF">highway</span> , and by that time, the front was already nearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">You could see the entire <span class="DLF">sky</span> red, you could hear the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">You could hear the , which were the Soviet rockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So at the -- in the evening when it was just about dark, we started moving, and we got to the main <span class="DLF">highway</span> in total darkness without lights, without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It seemed to be absolutely empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We got on the major <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Suddenly I see somebody striking a match, and my heart stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I see an SS helmet, and I see unshaven faces of several SS soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  I hate to do this, but we're out of tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It's a bad point to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Okay, let me just do something for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">When we unfortunately stopped you, you saw the SS helmets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  Almost automatically without thinking, I hit the bell on the fire engine, and we kept going on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And the Germans either because they are so disciplined, and to them it was very logical that somebody was driving -- that the fire engine was going towards the fire, didn't even think. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We passed that <span class="DLF">turnoff</span> where we were supposed to turn off and disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">What happened there, it was an SS Hermann Goring panzer division. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Four days later when we went through the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> out there, we could see the remnants of some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> who took part in that battle, mostly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">On the concentration point, we had some 3,000 people concentrated, which was this regiment and the calvary brigade I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">The <span class="DLF">defensive lines</span> were -- on several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , we took our <span class="DLF">defensive lines</span> and stayed on the <span class="DLF">defensive line</span> awaiting the front somehow to roll over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Because the front was still east of us, and they were withdrawing west. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So that night I see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> very high, flying from west to east. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">One of them burns, comes down like a meteor, and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">The next morning, I'm going on a patrol with a group of soldiers to penetrate the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to see if anything is going out which were like few hundred yards from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we see movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We see uniforms which don't look German. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">That's where Soviet paratroopers with a <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , they were dropped behind the <span class="DLF">German line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Well, we kind of waved at each other, the white thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Started talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">From them we learned that they were parachuted behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We told them we are the Polish guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We also told them that -- that morning, we found incidentally from that burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , we found one man with half-burned parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So we told them where buried the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">On the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , they passed that to their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Their headquarter wanted to know our strength, our <span class="NPIP">location</span> , where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Well, I wasn't going to give it to them, but I gave them a guide and sent them to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They wanted information, <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> could give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Four days later, we were withdrawing -- and incidentally, our involvement at that time was very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We didn't get into any major fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">All we were doing was disarming single or two, three German soldiers running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So it wasn't the war I was really trained for. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Four days after that, we're passing through the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we met this SS Hermann Goring division. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And the burned bodies in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were really telling us that that big tank battle between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Soviet tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> took place there, and that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> were waiting to jump on the moving Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Most of our officers, as I mentioned, were invited for a strategy session. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Never came back from that strategy session. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">The next time we heard from them was <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="541">Leave us as we are, arm us a little bit better and we go right now today with you for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Well, how naive I was as a young boy, it was all preprogrammed what would happen to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Stalin simply wanted that to last until <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> finishes <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , because he knew that all the fighters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> were anti-Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So he wanted Hitler to wipe out the anti- Communists for him, and that's precisely what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We as the faithful allies of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the <span class="REGION">Western world</span> , we were really let down and left to fend for ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I don't think we deserved that. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We were the most faithful friends the West had at the time, but that's how the war sometimes ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Lesson from it from my own personal experience is don't let the war ever happen on you own soil; fight it somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You fight it in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> or some remote <span class="NPIP">place</span> , at least your mothers, your sisters are not being raped and then murdered and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So let's fight it somewhere else, not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  My family, my younger brother found himself with -- he was at that time -- well, let's see, this was 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He was 17, I found him in the same concentration where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And, as a matter of fact, he was the first one who put Polish flag in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> on the ratush (ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">The younger brother and mother stayed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where they were settled after being kicked out of our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the fight took place in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Some of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was burned, and they stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I was -- my unit after - first of all, my unit was taken in the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , which was not much of a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Germans already were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">What I found, however, and never forget is the ruins and the rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Rats fed on the bodies, human bodies, were so fat and so numerous it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , I couldn't find one single <span class="BUILDING">house</span> unscratched. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Everything was burned and finished, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">My unit was ordered to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The other went east towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we were supposed to pick up from <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> remnants of Germans, individuals or still a small unit which was hiding somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They were not problems for us, the Germans out there because, you know, my entire unit were former underground guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Each one had some kind of a casualty, so right there that was for them the opportunity to even the score a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So we didn't take any prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The problem we had was with Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Soviet troops, before they entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they were told by Stalin, by their commanders, "After you cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> , do whatever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Just pay them for what they did in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And they really started in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> already that. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So they were raping Polish women, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We being on patrol duty because the being in the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> involved patrolling the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you come on incidents where there are some drunken Soviet soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Well, you want to disarm them; they don't want to be disarmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">What do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Well, in most cases, we had to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Sometimes, you know, a woman, for instance, reported every night a soldier, drunk soldier 1s trying to break into my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581"><span class="INT_SPACE">Apartment</span> , whatever she rebuilds, wherever she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Well, we left a couple of men there for a night with her one night, and sure enough, 11, 12 o'clock . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Russians want that she open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Well, after he was insistent on it, the boys opened fire right through the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and sure enough, there was a Soviet soldier on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was on the verge of getting rid of one occupant, Hitler and Nazis, but was at the beginning of another occupation, Red Terror, the Soviet, the MK VD. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw garrison</span> till March 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">March 1945, my commanding officer tells me, "They have something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">You have go and report to another unit where they give you the instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">You might be going to the front.’’ </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Which I wanted to go to the front anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I wanted to pay <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> back for what they did in my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with two other officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I didn't know they were not from my unit, and they pointed the <span class="DLF">door</span> to me, "That's where the commanding officer is. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">You have to report to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I entered the <span class="DLF">door</span> and immediately the guns were pointed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Two Polish officers in Polish uniforms, none of them could speak. " ," </span><span class="sentence" id="597">which means hands up. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They took my lieutenant's stars out, took my eagle from my cap, took my sidearm and the belt and I landed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">For three days, nobody bothered about me out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Then the interrogation started. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I'm accused of organizing underground within the army, which I did, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But who would be talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">How do they know? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">How much do they know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So I totally denied everything till the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I finally learned that another Lieutenant Oliva, his name, was also arrested and that he is a couple of <span class="DLF">doors</span> down from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So seeing that they don't have much, I denied till the end that it's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">That I'm a Pole who fights for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I had in July, after three months of interrogation -- I didn't sign anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I had a court martial. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">In court martial, there were three officers, staff officers in Polish uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">None of them could speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They needed a translator for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I was stripped of citizenship, of my belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Whatever was mine was no longer mine and got six years hard labor, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Then I was put in the infamous Rakayetska (ph) Prison in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Mostly people in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> were former AK. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And what happened in the meantime after I was arrested in March, my second in command, Lieutenant Horoshevski (ph), -- and he doesn't appreciate my fighting stories, the peaceful Swiss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  Okay, where we stopped, you weren't quite done. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Your second in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">You were talking about being 1n <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and your second commander.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  The second in command in my unit, Lieutenant Horoshevski, as I learned later, took whatever soldiers were in the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> at the time and fully armed crossed into the guerrillas who were operating still in that <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">They knew that there was something going on in this unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So on account of their being smart, advised I guess to take all the soldiers remaining in the brigade and spread them throughout the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So they took four, five, maybe ten soldiers, put them in this regiment; another 10, 20 in some other regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">That way the entire brigade in which I was disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So I landed in the <span class="BUILDING">Rakayetska Prison</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> which held mostly the former AK accused of -- well, being AK was enough to go to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">They were calling us at that time "spit-on midgets of reactionary forces.” </span><span class="sentence" id="628">That's how they called, Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">In that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> a lot of executions took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">By that time there were no Jews there anymore, strictly Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> where they were torturing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And we knew that because next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , they kept always the, what do you call, you carry the wounded on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Stretcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">There was always <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> and we could kind of peek and see that on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> , they were taking a body at night out. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> in which we were was very small, and there were some 13 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">One slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and actually to turn around, it had to be on command. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Everybody had to turn because there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">For urination and physical discharge, there was barrel kept <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , just covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So the smell was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">After that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , I was arrested in June -- I mean in March 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">In July of 1945, I was half blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Partial blindness from the lack of vitamins, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I lost some 60 pounds during that period of time, and I peeked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I see horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But all I could see is maybe left leg of the horse and the right ear and maybe a head of the peasant who was running it. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I couldn't see the full picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">One night in July, suddenly something unusual happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They taking us for a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they shaved us totally to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I mean head and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Well, the word went they taking us probably to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">They don't want Polish insects out there in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They have enough of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They washed us and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , several <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in on the property of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And they started loading people into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We didn't know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I suddenly looked and I see in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loys</span> (ph) my company chief, Sergeant Shuper (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He just happened, just happened by miracle that the group of soldiers when they disbanded the brigade was put in the unit which was ordered to transport us somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Now, Shuper recognized me immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Put his finger on his lips, and then when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> started moving, he jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That's when I learned that Horoshevski took the rest of our soldiers who were at the time in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and took them into the German guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">That's where I learned that the brigade was disbanded and Shuper 1s telling me that "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">When you ask to be taken to urinate out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> , just run. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And the guard will shoot above your head, so you don't have to worry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I told him, "No, either all of us or none.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="664">You will be going to a <span class="REGION">territory</span> where the guerrillas still operate, and I want you in every stop we make to pass the word that the AK prisoners are being transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And, of course, wherever we stopped -- and we stopped many times because the Soviet war was still on. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">The Soviet troops -- no, the war over in May, but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> east/west with the military equipment and troops were having the priority. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So we were stopped quite a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">We were singing the songs of the Warsaw uprising, the patriotic songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">People ...
QUESTION:  You know, I have to stop you. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">We have one second of tape ...
ANSWER:  People would look at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> with the barbed wire on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and look at our thin faces and listen to the song we're singing and they were crying and you know -- at least we knew we had the sympathy of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Nothing was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And then on one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , I noticed some younger people in the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And one of them kind of motioned and I see a gun, and I knew that somebody was observing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Next day, shots are fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Right away, I jumped to the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Through the <span class="DLF">window</span> I see, you know, a perfect performance of military tactic. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">A platoon coming out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped right there on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">There is no firing from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the people coming at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , not one shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The shots were guerrillas just warning. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Actually, it was a shot for the engine man who stopped because he was AK also. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And the railroad people throughout were notifying as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving who it is and where it's going. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">That was a guerilla unit of a man with a code name Orelek (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He sustained his unit hiding Russians till 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The war was over in 1935, he was fighting still in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">He was finally shot by the Valitsia. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But at that time we, of course, shouted, "Long live <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Long live comrades who liberated us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Disarmed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , gave the Poles in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> -- because the commanding officer was Polish, the political officer, second in command, was Russian and he ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And the rest were all conscripts and some AK, so the Orelek say, "Do any of you want to stay in guerrillas?" </span><span class="sentence" id="691">A few of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">The rest of them, we took their uniforms and let them go in their underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And that's how I joined Orelek's unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And Orelek was basically protecting Polish population from the abuse of MK VD and Militia. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">The Militia particularly, and they were arresting AK or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">He made them pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They concentrated so many troops, Russian and Polish, to get rid of him that it was not very comfortable anymore as a unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So he went into the old technique of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">People went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they were on call. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They were coming out on call to do the job which had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But I decided -- I had at the time a fiancée on the other side of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sopot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">People, my family and people thought that I was dead because something I have not mentioned during this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I was taken by Russians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> once and managed to run away from that situation -- and I have to catch my breath.</span></p>

ANSWER:  So the family thought that I was dead because there was an incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk- Suwatki</span> from which they deducted that the MK VD shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">What it was, myself and one of my soldiers, we were stopped by Soviet patrol and asked for the documents, who asked for documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Well, we, of course, didn't have the documents because in the guerilla we didn't documents, but we were fully armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So we clash and shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">From that where the Soviet soldiers were killed and my soldier was killed also. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And I was taken alive with the concussion by grenade because we jumped into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and defended ourselves in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So they accused me of being a German with a <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> who's communicating with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> still attacking Soviet troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was still occupied by Germans at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I managed -- and it's a long story, I will not elaborate too much, but I escaped from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So as you can see, the family and friends and everybody thought I was really after that incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , shot by MK VD. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">For that reason, when I decided to see my fiancée, when I showed up out there, it was a lot of joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And at the same time, a lot of worry that something might happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I stayed there for a few days, recuperated pretty well from the malnutrition I had in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and relaxed. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And the girls talked me into going to the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Well, I went reluctantly to the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And at the end of the film, two , those are policemen, Polish policemen, come to me and say, " 2" Which means "Are you citizen, and may I have your documents?" </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Well, my documents were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">They were not in my name, but they were perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The underground had very, very good <span class="NPIP">places</span> to make them. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And nothing was wrong with the documents, but they insisted I go with them to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I say, "Why?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="726">Well, we'll explain to you when we get there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="727">What could I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I was not armed at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I left everything behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">We go to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and I am accused because of my shaved head, I'm accused of being a deserter from the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Well, all the recruits in Polish Army get shaved the moment they start the military, and they keep them that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So here for the Militia man looking at my head shaven in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , it was an indication that he could be a deserter. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> praying that they don't transfer me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , because if they transferred me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , that's the end of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Managed to notify the girls of a contact in AK, and what they came up with is an ingenious solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They have prepared documents calling Mr. Orovski (ph), which is me under that new name to military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So the girls took that document to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and explained to the commander down there that "How can you keep him for a desertion from the army? </span><span class="sentence" id="737">That's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">He just got it today, the document calling him to report to the army.” </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Well, I accepted the cigarette from the commander and from the commander even a little shot of vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And he wished me the glorious service in people's army, and I said to myself at that time, "This is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">There's no life for me in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> anymore.” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I went back, covered my numbers with the Orelek's people, went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Said good- bye to mother, put a pistol behind my belt and starting moving toward the <span class="DLF">Polish borders</span> where we have <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And at that time it was the closest to the zone of American occupation because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was in American hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  Let me stop you here because there was something that confused me earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">When you said that your brother -- your mother and one brother was fighting in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  And where was your other brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  He was -- I don't even know where he was because we were not in the same unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He was totally separate from me, and I only noticed him that he was on the concentration. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But he stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and eventually was in uniform also. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Then got of the uniform ...
QUESTION:  But he was part of the underground, as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I just wanted to clarify that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  So I was moving towards the <span class="REGION">southern frontier</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , fully armed with good documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Managed to get to kind of a railroad important point, . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> I noticed some different uniforms, black uniforms and black beret. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And when I came closer I hear French language being spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Well, it happened that those were the French Shasserdelpen (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Whoops, . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">In English, the Alpine Fusiliers or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And they brought into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French occupation zone</span> , they brought in Poles back to their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And then they were returning back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I, with my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> French, I told the soldier that I would like to have a word with his commanding officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">A young lieutenant came in, I started talking with him with my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> French. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Told him that I am a Polish guerilla, that if I do not get into the allies in the West, I will be probably sooner or later caught and finished by MK VD. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Would he help? </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Would he be a good soldier and help Polish brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Well, he happens to be a French marquis also, so he understood the guerilla brotherhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And after a while, he came in and I got a black uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Put on the black uniform, and with the French through several Russian controls, as a matter of fact, I got through <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to the American zone of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And from there I was transferred to the Polish Army in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and attached -- or assigned to a Polish commander unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And that was how I bailed out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  What was the purpose of this Polish unit in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Polish units in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , they went under British command as part of the Eighth British Army, all the way from the beginning of war almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They took part in the -- there was entire corps, Polish corps consisting of some 60, 70,000 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">They went through the African campaign, they were fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tobruk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Then they went on landing. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">They took, as a matter of fact, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monte Cassino</span> , and when the war was over, they were occupying <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So I stayed, of course, in the unit all the time during the occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , except for a few months I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for young officers, company commanders. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And went through some commander training, additional. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And then we were just waiting until we returned back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> fully armed, kicked the Russians out of there sooner or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And accomplish what we started in 1939, fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Well, it just didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">It just didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">The order came in in 1947 for us to leave in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> all heavy equipment, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , all the armor, artillery, everything we had and were so proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And with short arms only to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where we were supposed to be demobilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Well, that didn't go very well with some of the career officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">There were instances that they shot themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">My school commander just couldn't see how we could be betrayed like that and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">All his dreams were shattered, so he shot himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I was too young to do that, and I hoped that one day I will still come to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of my fathers fully armed and that was to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">For 50 years <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was given to the Soviet Union by Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin by Yalta Agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And we suffered 50 years, and the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right now starts to recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">The best solution for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> right now 1s to be admitted to the NATO. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They're willing and ready and they won't shame anybody fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  I want to backtrack for a little bit if you don't mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  I have interrupted before, but the underground, I know that you said it was a mixture of people with many political organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Was that a problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They still tried to -- well, like, for instance -- but that could happen to almost anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">In my unit we had the night exercises, and we were shot at by the Akmechet and had two killed, two people killed from my unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Because they were having their exercises separately, you know, without communicating properly with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And we just walked into their defensive position and walked out of there minus two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But politically, we were not really involved at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We were a fighting force. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Politics for us, I didn't care what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I just wanted to defeat the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  Were there different approaches on how to go about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  There might have been on the high level. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">On my level, which is the front, right there in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> almost with maybe a hundred men under my command, there were no political problems whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  Did you work with the partisans at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Well, it 1s partisans; I was one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  How important was direction from the organization versus taking your own initiative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  To prevent chaos it had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I tell you sometimes it clashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">For instance, 1n my case, to give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We had orders not to touch individual Germans because it was bringing retaliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">That was in the early days, '41,'42. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Well, at that time me and a couple of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> friends, we disobeyed that order. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We were waiting for drunk Germans to get arms, to arm ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We just killed them and took their arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">But without direction from up above, you would have chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  Were there certain cardinal rules? </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Were there certain things that you were taught when you were inducted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  Well, one cardinal rule, and that's in the swearing, in the form of the swearing, even it's mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">That any cooperation with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or with the enemy will be punished by death. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Any snitching, you know, against Pole to the enemy or taking Jewish, anything which you do against the Jews, same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">It was strictly -- and was very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">There was no "if" and "but" on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We were to help whenever we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  What about secrecy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Well, secrecy how it worked, you had to keep the secrecy, and that's why to start with, you only knew four people besides you. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">The groups were five, five, five. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So if anything happened, only five -- might be a thousand, only five would diminish because you didn't know anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">There were not very many traitors in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , not very many. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And if they were, they were properly dealt with. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Went into <span class="BUILDING">underground court</span> , executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  Was the general population pretty supportive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  Without support of population, you cannot fight a guerilla war. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">You have to have a population on your side. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">The population, of course, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was frightened, was beaten to the pulp sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">You had to do some convincing occasionally so that they would help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">For instance, we had some problems with getting horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> to move from one <span class="REGION">area</span> to another <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Either wounded or equipment or even go in a quick action where you wanted to be faster than just walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Some farmers, you know, we approached. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They said, oh, they would do anything not to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Eventually, I think we took care of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  How did you know who to trust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  Well, you basically didn't trust anyone in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">You really didn't know who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">So you had to have either someone from your unit with whom you were for a long time or be on your alert with any newcomers you met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">QUESTION:  You were constantly on alert?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  Now, just in terms of sort of the logistics, of the difficulties in terms of getting -- how you got food, how you got information, how you got supplies, how you got directions, how did this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">First of all, the communications. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Girls, young Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts were used for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">They carried the messages between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and the commanders of the units. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Usually the messages were coded. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Couldn't use the <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> because Germans had very good equipment to detect. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">As a matter of fact, in the early days we had a special unit which was protecting the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">That the unit got into clash several times, and we abandoned that and instead, we had three, four people unit moving the <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> as many times as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">As far as logistics, food, we tried as many times as we could to sleep in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We had permanent quarters in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , deep in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , but in my <span class="REGION">area</span> the actions requested from us were such that they were in the different region of the <span class="REGION">region</span> we operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So quite often, you know, after one action, you had to almost the same night jump some 30 miles away somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So to do things like that, you had to have friendly villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And most of them were friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">A few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were burned because of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  By your people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  No, by Germans, because somebody said hey, maybe that's where they -- the partisans, as you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The Germans came tn, get confirmation from somebody on that from somebody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and this entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was wiped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">QUESTION:  Did your people have to resort to violent tactics to get food ever?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Now, we, of course, had other sources besides being fed my villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Some of our actions were not of purely military nature, they were of kind of commercial industrial nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Like taking, you know, thousands of liters of vodka or a hundred tons of sugar or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> of socks we took in <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And that was a very interesting one because it was in the middle of the German Army almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">On one rail, there was a military transport standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The other rails were occupied by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> which had the socks, army socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">An entire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And there was a guard there. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">We came in and we managed to disarm that guard without harming him at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Just took the bullets out of his gun, let him have the gun, and we told him, "You just keep walking the way you were walking before.” </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And we were simply loading and unloading from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> into the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> after another full of socks went in next to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  Why were socks important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Oh, you needed a lot of socks in partisans, in guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But you could also sell socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">When you sold them, you had money for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">We also had parachute drops from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , because at that time allies were already in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">As a matter of fact, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> during the uprising for some 40 days didn't get any assistance from anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was already failing -- the insurrection was failing, we got some supplies from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">The U.S. Air Force flew one sortie of supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And we, as a matter of fact, had American flyers whom we could identify decorated 50 years after Warsaw uprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  Were there women fighting with you in the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Women were mostly -- although they were not the fighting unit, but they were in the Red Cross Corps but with the partisans, with the guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">They were in communications. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">All kinds of axillary situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  And you mentioned one man, but -- and there were also Jews with you in the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  Not many, but there were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  They had their own organizations as well, didn't they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  That, I never come across anyone like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  Now, the question about when you were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , that you had a conventional job and you were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  Were you in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they had brought Jewish slave labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
