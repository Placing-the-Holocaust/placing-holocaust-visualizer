<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at that time and about your schooling and your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in 1923, as I said, and so I had 10 years without Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My parents originally came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the Austrian-Hungarian empire of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , at the age of 15, so by the time I was born, they had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about twenty years. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">During the first 10 years, what I can remember is people still had housing shortages and that was a result of the first world war, and it was very difficult to get a decent <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But that affected everybody, it wasn’t something that we felt we were singled out for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">But when it got to some of 1932, I was nine then, I became aware of the fact, there was some sort of tension between the Nazi Party and the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I remember marches in the <span class="DLF">street</span> where people beat each other up. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And in the block of <span class="BUILDING">flats</span> where I lived, a person was even shot because they were demonstrating against the Nazi Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So that in a nine year old, aroused some sort of fear that something was about to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  What was it like at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Did you feel very well acclimated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In fact my sister and I were the only Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And during the sort of beginnings of the Nazi party I had a very good teacher and he kept telling all the children that I was no different from anybody else and they had to treat me very well and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But that didn’t go on for too long because when I reached the age of 11 and I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> , I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> because it was very difficult to stay on in a <span class="BUILDING">state school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  You had many friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Yes, I had a, I used to play with the children in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I didn’t feel too discriminated against playing with the other children in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but I was always blonde and blue-eyed and so I suppose that made a difference too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Was your family particularly religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Well, not a terribly orthodox, but I as a child, I wouldn’t ride on a sharbot(ph) and I wouldn’t switch the light on. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">However my father kept his <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> open after going to a service in the morning, he came back because we lived in such a Christian neighborhood that, you know, we had to keep the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> open on a Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And our customers really didn’t stay away from us until an SS man stood guard outside the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and told people not to buy from Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And even then, some of them were very brave they came in and we had one particular customer across the <span class="DLF">road</span> from us, a Catholic baker, and they also weren’t very fond of the Nazis, and you know bakers have to get up very early to bake their bread, and they found somebody dobbing(ph) their <span class="DLF">shop windows</span> , friends of the Jews, and so they just poured buckets of water from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So that was really a very brave act in the climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Do you have a sense of how your parents felt at this time and what did your father do? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  We had a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Well, once or twice my father was beaten up 1n the dark when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And then things got a little difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But you see, when you’re sort of 12, 13, you don’t quite realize the dangers that were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But we did know of people whose fathers disappeared or they used to go and sleep in other people’s <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so when the party came to pick them up they wouldn’t be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they couldn’t be found. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So yes, things were getting very sort of disturbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But you know, people always say to me, “Why did people not leave early on?,” </span><span class="sentence" id="32">and the only theory I can have is, if you are very poor you can go because you’ve got nothing to lose, and if you were rich, you know at the beginning you were allowed to take your money out with you, but if you are a middle-class person then you sort of value a little bit of security. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So that’s the only explanation I have because we didn’t leave until 39 which was the last moment almost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  So they didn’t talk to you much about what they were thinking or about possibly immigrating sooner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  No, my parents really I think protected us quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They didn’t show their fears a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And our final moment really came when my father was deported in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I don’t know whether you know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My father had a Polish passport and at that time the Poles said that anybody who hadn’t returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for a number of years was going to lose their passports, and I think the Nazis got a little bit worried that they were going to be left with all these people with Polish nationality and they picked up all the men during the night and just deported them to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I think that’s when things started really to, for us, to reach a high point where we had to decide to do something, although we had to shut our <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> before that so when my father was deported he didn’t have any income anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Tell me, just going back just a little bit, when they closed the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  That was sort of the beginning of 38. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And they also made me leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was then decided education wasn’t going to be much use to you if you had to go into a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you didn’t speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So people got their children to learn a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I went to dress-making school, people became plumbers, and and so on because you felt if you had a trade in your hands you didn’t need to know the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  And what was your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Was your mother a full-time housekeeper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  No, she worked with my father in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Which of course I don’t remember which year 34, 35, you weren’t allowed to have anyone anymore unless they were over 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Because you know there was this word rusenshen(ph), I don’t know if you’ve come across it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But that’s why you’re not allowed to have anybody under 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about when your father was deported and how that came about and how you first found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Well, that was obviously something, a very well kept secret because in October, the 28th of October I think, during the night there is a ring at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and two men came in civilian clothes actually, and they said to my father , “Pack your bag, get your passport” . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And you know that was a very frightening experience and my sister panicked, she’s three years younger than I, and she started shouting at them and they said , “Well if you don’t keep quiet we will take you away as well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I must have kept calm because I remember I got up and made sandwiches for my father for him to take the sandwiches. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But we didn’t know why or what or where they were going to go, they didn’t tell us, and while they were watching my father I rushed out down the <span class="DLF">street</span> to go to a phone and phone my uncles to warn them, but a strange man answered the phone so we knew they had also got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And, then some sort of rumor came about that they had been taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> , and then all the women rushed to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to see if they could still see their husbands or fathers, but we didn’t see our father, but eventually we heard from him that he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And they had apparently there was some sort of tug-of-war between the Germans and the Poles because the Poles didn’t want to take them, the Germans wouldn’t let them back, and there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp where</span> they held all these people which was called bonchin(ph) and but my father still had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so he and his two brothers went to the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  So after he arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you were able to correspond with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  We were going to speak to with him on the phone, we were able to speak to him on the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Well it wasn’t war time yet, you see, it was 38, it was just before Crystal Night actually that they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The 28th of October, Crystal Night was in November so it wasn’t very far apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  So tell me a little bit about Crystal Night and that evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, I really got up, we got up the next morning, and you see not living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish area</span> we weren’t so aware as to what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Our <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> had gone so really there wasn’t much Jewish property for them to destroy. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But when we heard about it I walked to my Aunt’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and yes, you were walking through glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">You know once you neared <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and so on then you could see what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">That’s why it’s called Crystal Night, isn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We were walking on glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  In between the time that your father was deported and the time that you were attempting to leave did things get progressively worse? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">What was it like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  First of all we were asked to leave our <span class="BUILDING">flat</span> , for a German couple, and strangely enough my mother went to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and the judge gave her three months, which was quite unheard of, you know, that he should allow us to stay, and so he gave us three months, and we moved in with my aunt after that whose husband had also been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And then my mother started seriously to look around for some <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because we had no income. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">There was no safety anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We children couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So obviously, rather late, but we knew then that we had to leave, because you see even the lot of the German people I think didn’t believe that our friends anyway that he could stay in power. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And a lot of the Jewish people who had become so much part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the professional people who held jobs in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and everywhere, nobody could believe that an intelligent nation could allow in a dictator which in a way wasn’t imposed on them, because Hindenburg supported him and he really got in by legal means but nobody thought that such a tyranny could go on but they are, that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And so then my mother started looking around and by that time it was very difficult to get a visa to go to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and so people took any visa they could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I know friends of ours went to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and eventually these Cuban visas came up and you had to pay for them with them with foreign currency, which really meant you had to smuggle money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in order to have dollars to pay for these visas, which my mother did, she smuggled money out, and she didn’t even know who it was going to, it was some sort of code name, you know she talked to somebody about uncle so and so, I remember that as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And then eventually we bought visas with the foreign currency, and which was supposed to be perfectly legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And then my mother had to arrange a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to take us across and she got four passages on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> called the St. Louis which was meant to sail from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> on May the 13th, which it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the Germans allowed people to come back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> providing they were leaving again. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It was a sort of transit visa they allowed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My father applied to come back and the Poles sent the wrong brother back, so my father didn’t make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And so my father phoned up in tears and he told my mother not to go without him, and she must have been a very determined woman because she said “I have to take the children out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">In any case, there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> leaving after ours, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Orinoco</span> and she couldn’t get four passages on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , but one she could get, so she was determined to take up three of the <span class="DLF">passages</span> and my father was going to join us afterwards on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  You had how many siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  [had a sister, I have a sister still, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  So at the time you had your mother, you and your sister, the three of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Three of us were going yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And actually the finalization of the visas didn’t happen until the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We were to leave on a Saturday and Friday morning we still hadn’t heard that everything was finalized, so my mother rushed off to sort things out, then she called me on the phone and I went with her, and then on the Friday afternoon we got everything finalized, and we phoned my 12 year-old sister and she did all the packing and we left on the Friday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Do you know much more about how she obtained...
ANSWER:  The visa?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  No, I’m afraid I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I just know that she had to pay with it for it with foreign currency and I think they were bought abroad, paid for abroad in the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban embassy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So your father never made it out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Never made it out, no? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You know, if you know the story of the St. Louis, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> , they wouldn’t allow us to land, and the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was leaving two weeks later, and when the captain heard that we couldn’t land I think they got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , they turned back but they didn’t tell the passengers they were turning back, and they ended up back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then my father had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we never saw him again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  So he did manage the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  He managed the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> but he went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So tell me a little bit about the passage, initially you were on the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">St. Louis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yes, well we left on May the 13th, and if you manage to get a hold of the documentary, you will see how efficient the Germans are because they found all the old footage of us getting on, and they even found me as a 15 year old amongst all that crowd getting onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But we left on May the 13th and for us youngsters it was really quite an adventure, because this was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury liner</span> , and the captain was a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He instructed the crew that we had to be treated like anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We had to pay for the return journey, but nobody really saw anything into that because we all felt the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was going to come back empty and it was only fair that they were paid for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And it was an experience to be on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liner</span> where you had a <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> and a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> , and all the usual games you have on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Obviously very few of us had ever been on a cruise so it was exciting for us youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But my mother never took part in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She didn’t worry us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And it must have been an awful thing to leave your <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you’ve lived, and leave a husband behind who didn’t want you to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My mother had ten marks, which I don’t know how much it would have been then, perhaps twenty dollars or something for the three of us, that is all we were allowed to take out. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So she must have been terribly worried about the future, you know two children, twenty dollars, no job, nothing to go back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And so, but she never worried us at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And during the first 10 days we really had a very good time until we landed and found that things began to go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  What was the feeling within the passengers with you as a teenager could get a sense of anywhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span> between the...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  The main thing is, we saw so many people with shaven heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And it appears then, we sort of found out they were people let out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , they had to sign papers to say they would never return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they were let out, and these people seemed to take longer to take part in the festivities that were going on, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We had our Friday night services, we had a portrait of Hitler in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> , but the captain allowed us take it off during the services and then it had to be put back after the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It’s very difficult for me now to say what I remember as a teenager and what I’ve read since, of course, it’s very difficult to separate these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Because there was also a book written about it, called “The Voyage of the Damned,” but unfortunately I feel it’s a little bit of a soap opera and they made a film of that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And so I don’t know if I know it from the book I read or whether I really knew it that there were people watching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The only thing I know is my mother had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> on her own and one night she woke up and found somebody searching through things and walking around the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And after that she never slept alone again. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So I don’t know how much truth there was in it all, that we were being watched.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Did you know before you hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> at all that the visas, the transit passes was canceled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Not really, except somebody said on the way there that there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> coming from somewhere else, and I can’t remember where from, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or somewhere else, and they said, “We really should hurry and get there before the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> so that we don’t have to hang about too long.” </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Now I don’t know if there is any significance in that or not, but for certain we didn’t know anything until we got there, and we were even told to get up very early the next morning and had our breakfast and we were lined up with all our suitcases ready to get off, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> stopped quite a way outside the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Well, once again we thought that was quite normal, you know, it is always deep enough for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go right into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and we had stopped <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and the Cuban police came on and the immigration people, and then suddenly the atmosphere changed and we were told, “not today, not today, meyeniana(ph) tomorrow, tomorrow,” but tomorrow never came, and then people were getting anxious but nobody ever gave up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You know we were so near <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we never thought anybody would allow us to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I mean nine hundred and odd people that’s really nothing is it , a drop in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  There were some people who left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Yes, but they were I think Spaniards and Cubans or something, and one family I remember leaving, left because I think somebody paid them a lot of money for them, but I think they were just family if I remember correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But the others I think were people that had that weren’t refugees that had come to holiday or to play in a band or something but I really don’t remember these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And one man of course committed suicide and he was left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And that I remember very well because I was standing by the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and I saw him rushing out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> with the blood dripping down and he ran to the edge and jumped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And one of the sailors actually jumped after him and rescued him. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But even when he was in the rescue launch, he was still trying to pull his arteries out and he didn’t want to be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  He had cut himself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yes, with a razor blade. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Because he‘d been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and decided he wouldn’t go back, and I suppose people’s condition wasn’t good you know when they got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , their minds must have been very confused anyway, and then to be faced with the problems that we might have had to face, he couldn’t put up with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  So what happened, you’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> for a few days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Several days, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And then they decided, the Cuban authorities decided, that no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> could stay in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> for such a length of time and that we should leave the, I think it’s a three mile zone or whatever it is, and just go back and cruise around until more arrangements were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I believe the American Joint(ph) worked very hard for us, and they wanted to pay money for us, but I think it was more a political issue because I think whatever they offered it was decided not to accept the money and not to accept us. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Whatever reason they could give for us, I really don’t know, I really only know what I have heard since, so I don’t know what the political issue was that why they wouldn’t have us. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And then we just went off and cruised along the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and Florida and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gun boats</span> came out in case somebody jumped overboard and swam ashore you know, and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And eventually when we turned back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we still really didn’t know what was happening because we didn’t know which direction we were going in, so for quite a time we were in a way left in the dark except they had a committee which apparently knew what was going on but certainly we teenagers didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Do you think your mother was involved in...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  She wasn’t involved in the committee, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Did she know much more than you did about what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Well, she never showed anything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I just know that she never took part in any of the journification so obviously she was worried all along, so I really don’t know if she knew any more than we did, but probably she suspected more than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Probably had a greater fear than we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Now what was life, what did you do just on a daily basis on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> as all of this was happening as a teenager, as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  You mean after we couldn’t land, because before that we had a jolly good time, we swam and played games and went to dances and film shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> and then you..?.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Well, then really very few people attended the sort of film shows, and the dances, and all that, because there was a sort of cloud hanging over us, even though you had hope that you weren’t going to, that you were going to land somewhere eventually, but obviously it was a worrying time because you didn’t know what your future held for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Did you make new friends while you were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yes, I made quite a lot of friends but really we didn’t keep it up because a small, a quarter of the people ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and a lot of those eventually got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> anyway because so many of them had quota numbers to get into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at a future date, and so quite a few left during the war even, and I think we were sort of spread around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I in particular was sent away, straightaway two days after we arrived I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seaside</span> to scrub <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> for them you know, because the only work you were allowed to do was domestic work, so I was sent away straightaway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  So this is after, obviously you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  So you were still in Belgtum?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Oh no, no, we ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Yes, well eventually when we had to go back towards and we knew we were going back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , as far as I know several other people tried to commit suicide, and we had a group of young people checking all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> to watch people, and it was a very grim atmosphere then of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And when we were off the coast of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> suddenly we heard that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were prepared to take a quarter each of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And obviously a lot of people wanted to go <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , because the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were to near <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And my father obviously knew what was going on because he sent us a telegram and said “Choose <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But really one didn’t have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They decided where people should go and people’s different nationalities they had different quotas how many people they would take in of each nationality and my mother told me to go and speak to the Immigration, English Immigration Officer because I had learned English at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">How good my English was I really don’t know, but I did talk to the man and whether that had any influence or not I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But luckily we ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> first landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and the people that were staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> obviously got off and the others were transferred by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and we were put on a sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we’ve heard since that at the time Gobels(ph) published in the newspapers you see nobody wants samiva(ph) at least we are building camps for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  And you all three stayed together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Well, not quite. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We stayed together for the first few days, because the Jewish Committee, 1t was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , it was <span class="BUILDING">Woben(ph) House</span> , gave people, put people into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for the first week, but I after three days we were sent away immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">My sister was 13 and she went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  So where were you sent away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  It was seaside place called Broadstairs(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was a <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> actually for Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And, but, the matron of the <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> was not Jewish, and there were three of us actually and we were always hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The didn’t feed us very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  So this was the middle of, this 1s the end of June, the beginning of July?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Yes, in fact we came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the 19th of June I think, because my sister’s birthday is on the 18th and we still had that on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Yes, that was towards the end of June then, yes, yes, and I stayed there until September and then I met a family on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and they asked me if I would come and look after their children for them, of 6 and 11, and I was getting in English money, 25 p(ph) a week and they were offering me a pound a week or something, and so I obviously accepted, ended with going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> so I accepted that job and the children were as I said six and a half and 11, and I was 15, and they asked me to do the cooking and the cleaning, and if the children couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they asked me to write the letters to teachers, so somebody must have had great fun reading my writing, but still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  And what about your mother and your sister, what were they doing at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  My mother eventually found work with some...[end of side one]. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So, at what point do you want me to start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I kind of like, eventually we can get back to what we were just talking about, but you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and you were working for a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Yes, I was working for a family then and then of course the war broke out, and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and we, at one stage, went and slept in the <span class="BUILDING">underground stations</span> to protect ourselves because of the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But I stayed with that family for about six months and once war broke out, we were allowed to do war work, and so then my sister had been evacuated by then, but my mother and I found <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and we lived together and I went to work making soldiers uniforms and gunpowder bags, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  What was the name of the family that you stayed with in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  No I didn’t say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Nash(ph), actually Nash(ph) yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was an English family Nash(ph) yes, changed from Nashinski(ph) , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  So you came back together with...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  My mother and then eventually my sister came back from her evacuation too, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">She went to a dressmaking school actually and then had to find a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I was working, but in 1943 I got married and moved out again, I got married at 19 and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  And how did that come about, if you don’t mind me asking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  How did that come about? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I went to a Czech garden party with a man actually who has since became an actor, his name was Herbert Long, but he wasn’t an actor in the days I knew him, he played in the Pink Panther films, but you won’t remember that you are too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But, and my husband asked me to, well, this man asked me to dance, and then saw me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> afterwards and told me that if I was still going out with him two months later I would marry him and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And my husband was 21 and I was 19 and a half but he had no family. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he was alone so possibly that’s the reason he was in such a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  And so you are married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  I was married, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And then my husband decided perhaps he should go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and so he didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> until after we were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  You stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  For a period, but the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> he went to was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span> , and so we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span> for four years until he got his degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  What was it like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , you continued to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Yes, we had our bombings and hiding in <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , and eventually I think a lot of people gave up and just took their chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And of course we had the blackout. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was very difficult to find your way around because in those days we still had these famous London fogs that you only see in Sherlock Holmes films nowadays and I can remember ending up in somebody else’s <span class="DLF">yard</span> at the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it really was quite impossible to see and find your way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">On the other hand one felt very, very safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">You know you’d walk around without being able to see anybody and people would talk to you and as a young girl, you never felt afraid to walk about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  What was, as far as Europe, what was happening in Europe and the holocaust there, the in time...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Well one didn’t really know how horrible it all was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And we still heard from my father for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But I’d just like to back when we first came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">My mother couldn’t speak English so she went to the East end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , which was the Jewish part in those days, and she could speak Yiddish, and she went from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , and asked somebody if they could guarantee for my father to come out, because he could come if you had somebody that would guarantee for you, and in fact she found somebody who offered him a job, and his papers were being processed and the war broke out, so he lost his second chance there. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So I’m only saying that just to add again what a brave woman my mother was, making a decision for us to leave without him with two children and very little money, and then she immediately set about trying to get him out, and so she was really a very active woman because we relied a lot on her before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> too because when we had our business eventually wholesalers wouldn’t deliver to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> , so my mother used to get up at 5:00 in the morning and go to the <span class="BUILDING">markets</span> and bring in the eggs and the butter so we could still sell the stuff in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So she really was a very, very strong, active woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But now getting back to after the war started, we heard from my father until about 1940, because we had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> so he could send the mail via these two addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Just recently I came across a postcard from him actually and which I think historically is quite interesting because he gives his address in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gesshue(ph</span> ) and it says “<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ” and in brackets “Formally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So in effect you see once the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the address had to be <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It is interesting, isn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Until I looked through all the stuff my mother left behind, I didn’t realize how really historically interesting that must be that they had to write their address ““<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ,” and in brackets “Formally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  What were the, what did you hear from your father, any indication of what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  There were only a few <span class="DLF">lines</span> actually, we haven’t heard for such a long time, are you well, I’m sorry you have to work so hard, write, and you know that’s just these few <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And my husband actually he died three years ago but before that went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because apparently they have quite a few archives there too, to see if he could find out what happened to my family, but they had records of people who died a natural death, but not records of people who were eventually sent away or deported so we never found out what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  So eventually the correspondence just stopped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Correspondence stopped yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And of course the Red Cross made all sorts of inquiries so you know nobody turned up after the war, so one knew that they had gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  What was it like when you first, when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , what was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Was it easy to acclimate? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">You spoke at least a little bit of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Yes well, I must have spoken quite a lot, because I was sent out to do the shopping, and of course I was in that <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> , and the matron that ran it only spoke English, and I think I probably learned quite a lot looking after the children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, I seemed to have, as I say, learned it very quickly, because I can remember after I got married being ill, and the doctors saying to my husband, “That’s a real Londoner you’ve got there, isn’t it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So I must have lost my accent fairly quickly too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  So it was fairly easy acclimating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Yes, for me it was, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  How about your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She sounded like she, where were you living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , was it East end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  No, no, we weren’t living in the East end, at one time we were living in Klisl(ph) Park, and then eventually we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Hampstead</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Actually only about a year before I got married we took on that <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  And did you become involved in the Jewish community at all besides.........
ANSWER:  Well, not an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We had Jewish friends and I had one particular friend from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> actually, who eventually emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and I am still in touch with her and I even went to see her in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , and some of the people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , although I hadn’t remembered them but when we had this reunion to make the documentary, actually they only had nine of us because that’s all they could afford, three people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and six from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and three of the six, I am going to see on this trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  So, you were married, and then you eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span> for my husband to do his studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And he did a degree in glass technology(ph) which is an unusual subject, but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought his parents over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because they had, in fact, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakoff(ph</span> ) and as the Germans marched in they marched out towards the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> and eventually the Russians sent them right deep into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and although they had an awful war, there were no worse off than of the Russians because nobody had any food, so they were discriminated against where they were and they came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakoff(ph</span> ) right after the war, and then we brought them over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they always said they had been the happiest years of their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So that was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  So after the war everything was fine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I mean we lead perfectly normal lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We had our first child in 1950, a daughter who lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> , and we had two more children, one of them we lost he died at the age of 18, he had polio and eventually ended up in a car accident in an invalid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and then I have a son in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and I have now left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to live near him since I lost my husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Well, I think perhaps everything that is of interest I have told you because once I got married we lead a fairly ordinary life, perhaps not so ordinary as far as people are concerned now because we brought his parents over, we kept them for awhile, and it isn’t often that the children are responsible for parents, it is normally the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But it was such a normal thing in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You never felt that you had been hard done by or you did more than you should have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I think we often felt very sad about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">You don’t realize until it happens to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My mother had 18 years of married life and when we were youngsters we thought that was a long time, but obviously it isn’t a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And so she really had a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We often felt sorry for her, but she was never a miserable person, and all she said was “I just want to see my daughters married,” and when she saw her daughters married, “I just want to see my grandchildren,” you know, so really there’s always people always hope for more. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And then eventually she even saw her great-grandchildren so that was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  So she went on the best that she could?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  She died in her 91st year, so really...and dearly loved by everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Her sons-in-law thought she wonderful because she never interfered. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And so we really had a very nice family life, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  You were saying earlier that you didn’t find any difficulty talking about your experiences and do you have any reflections on the Holocaust and what happened in Europe and what may have happened to you and what may have happened to your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Well, it’s something that I think is horrendous, but it’s quite difficult to comprehend even though you know it has all happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I must say that I watch all the films and things and people always say to me “Why do you punish yourself like that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And I just feel that at least I must experience second-hand what these people went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I think it’s a cowardly attitude to say, “TI can’t watch these things” because if my family could go through it at least I should know and get upset by what they’ve been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But everybody has to deal with things in their own way, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But not to want to know, I think, is really denying the fact that these people existed and what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Well I hope you feel happy with what I’ve told you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  I really appreciate you taking the time to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Yes, but do you feel you’ve had sufficiently out of this interview, or did you want to ask me any questions?</span></p>
