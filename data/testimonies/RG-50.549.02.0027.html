<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, our family consists of father and mother and two sisters and two brothers and myself, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My father’s name, Hebrew name was Eliakim. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">In Polish, he was Yakob, which is Jacob, but it’s no -- no connection to the Hebrew name. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My mother’s name was Rosa -- Raisil in Yiddish, but the Polish name was Rosa.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And her maiden name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Her maiden name was Kirzner. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And my brother next to me was Chaim and was born in 1917, then we have a sa -- I have the sister, Miriam, who was born 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And next came my brother Reuben, who survived the war, still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And he was born 1922. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And had a little sister who was born in 1927. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">She -- I was 12 years old when she was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  And her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  And her name was Hannah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Were you -- and -- were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  We were very close, we were very close, but my problem was that I did not live at -- with all of them all the time, because since I lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and my father wanted me to get some kind of education, which started about three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I was shipped off to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was about 12 mile -- 12 kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where there was a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">As a matter of fact, my father worked there one year as a teacher, after he lost his job, which I talked about in the -- on the videotape. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I used to be away from them for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And later on, I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koven</span> , which 1s the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> not far from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And again, I -- I missed my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was there only one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">This was my formal education. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And then when I was 16, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> also, to go in search of a -- learning a professional job in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And sin -- fr-from then on, I was away for quite a few years, returned about a year or two before the war came. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Then a year before the war, I came -- I -- I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">A son was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">His -- My wife’s name was Rifka. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This was in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I omitted it from my videotape. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And my son’s name was Benjamin -- Benjamin. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He -- He -- He lived only three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He was born in ni -- you know, we were married in 1938, he was born in 1939 and in 1942, in September, a week before Rosh Hashanah, the 23 days in the month of Ell, Hebrew month, they were all taken out and shot, including my little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">That’s [indecipherable] was my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  This was in that -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> , which we visited two years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I think my wife told you about a visit to -- the trip there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  She talked about the trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> , but didn’t talk about your trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, it started with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I was in the Soviet Union, working a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And I found out about -- I knew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- I read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> , we had a cultural life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There were -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> with papers and books which you could read. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of subscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few months, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a dozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So, he gave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But, to me it had a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But I could sell it afterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I, myself, was smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And we used to have a kind of -- there was some commerce in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Womens used to come out from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and had a little -- put like a -- a <span class="BUILDING">kiosk</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And if you had money, you could buy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold by the glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were chopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Now, once a mon -- once a week, I used to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp commerce, and buy tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But I had to buy a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">A newspaper cost 10 rubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and one use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the tobacco roots, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I didn’t have to sell my bread ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So -- and in the press, there wasn’t much about the Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The Soviet press didn’t write much about it, they wrote about atrocities committed against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Of course the particular Jews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But -- And they knew about it, of course, but they didn’t -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , there was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , which was liquidated by -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , of course, they had to mention the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because there’s only one kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So they mentioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So there wasn’t much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But one day, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was located, I wrote a letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if there’s any information about my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It so happened that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was not liberated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">For quite awhile, <span class="NPIP">places</span> changed hands back and forth, but I -- another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> close to it, was already liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother was also a partisan of the sa -- the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was already liberated and he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And when they saw my name -- my return address, with my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He read it, sent to my brother and my brother answered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows that he -- he 1s -- he 1s alive, everything 1s -- all is well. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NK VD, secret -- <span class="DLF">secret police farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And he sent me -- he would sent me some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew that I was in bad shape, so he send me some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">A few days later, I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his brother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I knew -- then I find out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I had in mind that my wi -- in 1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by the way, this information is in the videotape, but I’m telling you so you understand what I am talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens, til ‘39, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out, back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn’t make any sense, it repeats again. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But, I ha -- I thought [P’ll be able to go by this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and see what -- you know, where the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was, at least, fo-found out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there, because th-they routed me through a different way, through <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> , through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and - but I always dreamed about coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> and putting up a monument, which was impossible during Soviet days. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">First of all, they didn’t allow any monuments which specifically said Jews perished there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So, 1-1n -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did after the war, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So, is good that they did not go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But I -- I -- It was a kind of - became an obsession for me to come and put up a monument. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Now, when you co -- then they st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov’s time already, they start allowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on these monuments, and they allowed to have Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I don’t know if you know about that pol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about, ‘“There’s no monument in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babier</span> ,” which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> -- probably heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And he wrote he’s ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up m-monuments in these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , so they did allow, finally they did allow. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then, in the beg -- middle of this decade, since ‘95, I think, <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> became independent and they allowed, already. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And there was a fellow in our -- 1n -- in the -- in the <span class="REGION">province</span> there, who, as a matter of fact, he’s -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn’t -- he said himself Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And he started putting up this monument with government help, first Soviet and then the independent Ukraine. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I got in touch with him, I found out there is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a organization, it’s called the <span class="BUILDING">House of Waleen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waleen</span> is the name of the province which has records of many. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">There’s probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They didn’t send them to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , they killed them right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was exploded dump, <span class="DLF">oil dump</span> that the Soviets built and they exploded it and then they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews in there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And this is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- so it was a military zone, belonged to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And you could not go into any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in army during Soviet days. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They agreed theyll let us put up the monument. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how much it’ll cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But it came the day when they’re supposed -- already the monument is ready and they decided nyet, they’re not allowed to on the mili-military. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, I -- finally it was ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG -- GME, I think it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That used to be WGAM. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">This is affiliate of CBS. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">No, wait a minute, was NBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">NBC, ABC, what’s it,

<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  CBS, yeah, CBS, with a cameraman and a reporter. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Reluctantly the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> agreed to pay her expenses, she wanted to go very badly, but you couldn’t go, because they said they wouldn’t allow to -- later on I found out they did allow it, make a long story short, and we -- we scheduled a trip for the next year, 1960 -- 96, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I had a group of about 12 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There was myself, my wife and my daughter from <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The one from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> couldn’t make it, she couldn’t get vacation at that time, which I hope by next year to take her and some of my grandchildren, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we f -- and two women, one -- both of them lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , one now is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and the other one works in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , daughters of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then there was another son of survivors, whose father was a partisan with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My brother and his wife and his three children, made a group of 12 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And a friend of mine who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> came with us and Rochelle, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And we came -- we visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> , this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We -- I have some pictures, I'll show you, of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I also have a tape from that time, to all- put this all in. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We were met by the officials of the local government -- the head of the local council and by the officials, the hea -- the head of the -- deputy chairman of the regional council, which probably that’s about 20 to 30 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- like a <span class="REGION">county</span> , approximately, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Went with us with -- they -- we rented a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and we stayed at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , without cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My wife probably told you about the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> [indecipherable] tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we stayed there two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We visited this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we put up the monument. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We made -- you know, dedicated -- dedicated the monu -- the monument was standing already. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It was -- had the description of Hebrew, Ukrainian and -- and English, not in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And we started talking among ourselves, my friend from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , this -- remarked it should be in Yiddish also, even though nobody can understand, nobody can read it, we are here, you know, the few of us old ones to understand, will be gone soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So we commissioned him, developer there, to put -- and we gave a few hundred more dollars, to put up the -- I had my -- the inscription in Yiddish, I had prepared all the -- all of them, all the descriptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So I gave him a copy of it and he sent me a photo that it’s already there, it’s put on. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They also decided to -- we decided it needs a wider, more -- under the -- what do you call it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">A wider foundation because it might topple. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It looks good. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was a beautiful [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So, we visited there one day and the same day we went to -- to more neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">One, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was born, and --
QUESTION:  Which was? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">What was the name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Which was called Threeanoffka, Threeanoffka. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And the -- there is a <span class="DLF">monument</span> they put up themselves, <span class="NPIP">place</span> it is sa -- they say 345 Jews were buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I don’t know who counted them, but that’s what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It’s in Hebrew and in Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there is a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , par-part of which survived, ironically, a -- a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> that survives here, because the -- most cemeteries didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But, after the day, I was so -- we as - we have to go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we had relatives there and the -- one of the participants, [indecipherable] his parents lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, there was already late and he talked me in, th-the fellow that put up the [indecipherable] talked me into go. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Not -- It was only a few minutes away, I realized afterward. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, hopefully I'll go there again next year. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And there, I know, there’s a -- there’s some stones still standing, one -- including I know one from my grandmother, my paternal grandmother is buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And all -- all my relatives are buried there that died naturally, you know, the -- over generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I don’t know how much of it is left though, but I can’t wait to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where there about -- over 3,000 people buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And we came back to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , we came to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we lied down there fo -- to have a nap, to have supper late -- oh, yeah, th -- I didn’t tell you about this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They invited us to dinner.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  The -- The officials invite us to dinner and there might have been about 20 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The commandant of the base and his little girl and a few other people, th-the driver, the photographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We had -- We had the video photographer, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Whom -- For whom, you know, we paid, but it -- pennies, you know, si -- their -- their currency was so -- it was 280,000 rubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Ukrainian rubles, not

id="266">Behind that, about 20 yards away, there’s a whole new section built of new <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And I have the suspicion they were

<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  When I was young, my teenagers -- teenaged years, youngsters in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were very busy in politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">We have nothing else to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">There was no work, there wa -- we had to find the enemy and who the enemy was, who knows?

<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I did relate to [indecipherable] more so -- more so, because this was a thousand percent improvement on what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I never lived in a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I came and I got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woonsocket</span> , <span

there were many things later on I found out that I knew it was not so great. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But compared to what we had, this was <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I made my first wages, a dollar five an hour, union wages, that’s a help on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I

id="645">Truman was just elected and they -- they thought the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ’s go-going on to the dogs, economically, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So I stayed -- it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So when I came, they gave me a job in a

class="sentence" id="652">And their Hebrew was zero -- and they gave me first a fifth grade with their teacher supervising me. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Well, I didn’t do badly because they understood some Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I have a natural knack of teaching, even though I have no academic preparation for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But I -- I could convey, you know, whatever I know to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I did all right, he says, “You have promise.” </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So then, there was -- th-the-then the school year ended and there was a teacher, a young lady in the first grade and her contract called for the school year, she quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They decided to keep the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> open another two months -- do -- two weeks or three weeks, I don’t remember what. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">The parents, they are

id="661">So, they gave me this first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I am by myself with a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> about 30 kids, don’t understand a word of Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They can’t read already, hardly and I don’t understand a word of Eng -- they smelled a rat right away and this was the worst time of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So, anyway, wi -- it lasted only a couple of weeks and the principal said, “Maybe start the new year, I’ll send for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Meantime I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woonsocket</span> , I got this job in the -- dollar five an hour, union wages. </span><span class="sentence" id="666"><span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> used to pay 75 dollars a week for about three hours a day, few days a week, which was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And the -- also, he ga -- they send me to the -- <span

summer, I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , I got another job and there I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew college</span> and they told me they’ll let me into a third -- I -- I had to take a-an exam in a few -- I -- a few subjects I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Talmud, I think 1t was and some other -- Hebrew, I -- the la- language and I didn’t have problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">But I didn’t decide -- but I had a cousin -- my cousin’s wife, who’s to me like a sister and that -- she died already, and she says, “Working in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> is not for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It was a [indecipherable], I was a foreman there. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It was 20 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">It was not easy either, but I managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They pay me -- what -- came from 42 dollars a week union wages, I got 32 dollars as

up to 75 cents an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Was 30 dol -- they -- they made more -- more than I did, almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So, she says, “You have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you have to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So it’s either <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew college</span> , or --” she sa -- I says, “My father was an accountant, self taught.” </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He is got some correspondence course. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So I knew a little bit about bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So I went to Bentley’s - <span class="BUILDING">Bentley College</span> , which is now a big <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">At that [indecipherable], it was a little -- little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="DLF">Boylston Street</span> and I took accounting. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So, I worked for three -- three years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , then we got married -- I got married, had a daughter, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So- What were they talking about -- we talked abou-about something else, we were talking about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span

id="694">There are many bad things, you know, the Nixon and this and -- McCarthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But these were things that did not apply to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I knew I can go anyplace -- I knew -- none -- it wasn’t easy at that time, either, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandeis</span> was built, because it was hard for Jewish student to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , they had a -- they had the certain number they would accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But they were a certain number, not zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="698"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it was, well, not zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Point point something, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And we

</span><span class="sentence" id="702">I took my Americanism very, very seriously.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">ANSWER:  And th-there were times when survivors did not want to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Now everybody writes books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Some are good, some are not so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">It’s a -- It’s a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">It’s a -- So, to be on the -- it -- it will be a short time before all of us are gone, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I am 83. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Some are a little younger and some a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">So -- And every so often you hear -- some of our friends are gone, died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">So, if there’s nothing left, might be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And it shouldn’t be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Because it’s still happening, you know, th-the ethnic cleansing, what’s going on in the former <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and all over the world, not just there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And if we don’t teach it to the future generations, this might repeat itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">But there’s not compare -- it never happened, such a tragedy, you know, 1-in Jewish history or in an-any oth -- any other history, where the -- a -- a -- pr -- people developed a -- designed a program to destroy another people, using all means available to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">For -- For using their technique, they’re using their sophistication just to kill people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">So it never happened before, and it ha -- we -- so -- so it -- it’s incumbent upon us to see to it that it -- it doesn’t happen again, to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">We try to do all we can to prevent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">So, ’'m thinking maybe I’m doing a very good job, the Maine Holocaust [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">But, by the way, we are on the internet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">We have a page you can look it up.</span></p>

I -- I was the first accountant in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> to use a -- to use a computer for tax returns, 30 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">I paid for a <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="1480">ANSWER:  I had -- Well, I was never religious, but I had religious background, I knew about religion, I knew the Bible backward and forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">And I learned it since I was three years old, I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">I always had a kind of a -- I don’t know how to describe my relationship with religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">It’s -- It’s -- Rochelle has a hate - love, mostly hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">We -- We have problem when I discuss it with her, I say, “All right, G-God, if he did do the Holocaust, you know, if G-God did the Holocaust, all right, I can understand your hating him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">But at the same time, you agree that He exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">He or She or whatever It is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">Because you cannot be -- be mad at something that doesn’t exist, can you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">I partic -- I -- I was active here in every facet of Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> except religious institutions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">I belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , but I was several times elected to the board, I did not accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">I did not -- I was of the opinion, if you are a leader in a religious organization, you have to at least have set some example of -- of religious practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">And I could not do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">I consider religion -- Jewish religion as part of Jewish culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">It 1s in our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">Is there a God or isn’t a God? </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">I cannot determine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">| -- I think by my philosophy, I’m agnostic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">But I cannot deny -- that means I cannot deny there isn’t one, nor can there is one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">But, the-these tr -- the trappings of religion do exist in our culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">This ha -- This is part of our inheritance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">We do go on high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">I go, when I have chance, practically every Saturday here, when I’m in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , there is a big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and you don’t just -- there -- you’re not welcome, as a -- as a Snowbird, w-we are snowbirds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">That’s people that stay for the season. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">They accept membership, you know, for a low fee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">Membership are very high there, but for a low fee, for the few months you are there, but they -- you never get -- you-you’re a second class member. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">So we -- I don’t -- didn’t join. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Once in awhile we go, they had cultural events in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , shows and concerts, we go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">But that’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Again, to put it in a nutshell, religion is part of our inheritance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">I don’t think we are ready to give it up yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">The idea would be, if there was one religion, one world religion, where they recognize one force, call it God, call it whatever you want to, a non- sectarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Will it ever be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">The <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> tried to suppress religion for 70 years and they did not succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">It is strong, it’s alive and people need it in their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">I never prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">If I do pray, I pray for national or global salvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">Peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">Very important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">Never -- I never prayed God for myself, help me get a good job, or -- I don’t think this power, which we call God, is designed for individual concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">I envy people that can have a personal religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">This is my God, I pray, you know, and He answers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">If they have it, more power to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">I cannot do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I see, when I did the prayers, you know, that we say on the high holidays, it’s poetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">The adulation of a power which we call God, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">I can’t understand why do we have to bless God? </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">This a power -- a omnipotent power that blesses us, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">So what -- what does my little blessing -- you know, we say a blessing, in Jewish life, there are lots of blessings, you know, that -- that 613, it’s what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">Commandments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">We have -- whatever you do, you make a blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">Blessed are thou, you know [indecipherable] brought forth from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">soil</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">But you have to bring it yourself from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">soil</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">Gives you th-the -- the tools of doing it, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">So, 1-if it’s a blessing, I have to ask for a blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">So I don’t think I’m more important a creature, as a ment, or any other creature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">So, I have -- I -- I think I’m in that class by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I don’t think anybody has the same -- everybody has his own -- his own belief, his own bi -- philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">I don’t think -- I’m sure that others have their own, other kinds of philosophies or -- or beliefs, or whatever and they think that theirs is right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">But I -- I would like to see if there’s a relationship -- if there has -- a religion has to exist, let there be one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">We -- We consider ourselves the chosen people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">Of course, they say we -- we were chosen to teach other peoples, but we taught enough -- yeah, we can taught enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">We -- Everybody knows the Christian Right knows the Bible backward and forward, you know, and they use it just for their needs, just what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">They, you know, they quote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">But the other thing, the good things are there, which they do not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">So, until -- now, you see, you take the Muslim world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">Religion is upswing in the Muslim, Jewish and Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">The same even with <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , which was a very tolerant -- you know, the Hindu, mostly Hindu, we’ll talk about the -- what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Eastern religions --
QUESTION:  Buddhists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1550">ANSWER:  Buddim -- Buddhism and the -- the Hindu I think was th-the most liberal one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">They tolerated other religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">But they -- Now they -- they -- they developed atomic bomb into the Hindu bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">The -- Pak-Pakistan developed a atomic bomb and it is the Muslim, Islamic bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">So <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> will have a Jewish bomb and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> has a Russian bomb and we start bringing in religion into politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">The greatest -- The greatest danger to the world 1s when we come on behalf, we c -- we represent God.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1570">QUESTION:  I have just one more question I think, and then if you want to add anything, but it -- do you think you can sum up, or explain something about how the -- your experiences living through the Holocaust in the wartime years ha-has affected your outlook on life?</span></p>
