<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  I have a couple of questions that I'd like to ask you before you go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">After the war was over did you witness any acts of retribution or retaliation against Germans or collaborators?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Well, the only thing we've seen--I've seen not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I myself was very sick so I did not see any action because I was really not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Because the only thing I remember, when, for the preparation to open up that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">women's jail</span> , they put us 1n a big <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> to wait till they clean up and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And there were quite a few survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Some of them looked pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And the Americans didn't realize they caught two SS so they pushed them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I don't know why they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And at that time these guys, you know, they had so much, you know, was so much bad blood, and they, and they killed them, in no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And, as a matter of fact, the American was surprised, angry at them, thought maybe they get some beating or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I don't know why they pushed them in between us people. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I remember they tried, somebody tried to take off his ring and his watch, and I was laying in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I was just half dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And the two guys must have been fighting for the ring, where the, where the toten cuff would be, and by fighting it they lost 1t and the ring just swung toward me so it came around and I just kept it out and I kept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My son got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He wouldn't give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He said it was his ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That's the only thing I saw, because later on the Germans were very, you know, you'd see those white flags all over, they're serious, and they, they always blame everybody else but not themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They always pointed out to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I did not really, although I myself felt if I had been liberated in January, like some other people did, I'd have been volunteer for the Russian Army and I would have been the first one to go in to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was so close to my mother and I always remember that she was with me all the time and I could actually, I couldn't kill a fly now but I could actually kill a lot of people dead, just remembering my mother, how she died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  You told me that you knew what happened to the members of your immediate family. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">After the war did you make, did you initiate any attempts to find any other relatives or friends from before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, after the war every community you encounter as you travel you put your name. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You have--and every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has a long list and people read them and most of the people remember, when you meet them say, hey, I've seen this and this in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the list, he's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So that's how actually people find themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">At that time we didn't have communications as we have, know now. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Especially right after war in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there was none. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So that's how people kept on traveling and looking and leaving their names on lists, different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">People would remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">That's how slowly, slowly people got together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  I wanted to make sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Did you go back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I knew what happened to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I knew what happened to my older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I met--I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I had a special entry permit to go but those days the Americans were occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> under the agreement, under Allies agreement, then had to pull back. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I used to go back and forth and bring some people from, crossing from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and I had a entry system to bring some few people with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That's what I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  And I met a friend of mine who actually lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived, and he told me not only nobody's there, they don't, they even bulldoze down the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , they bulldoze down the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , there is nothing absolutely there hometown. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And coming back I myself, as a young boy, I experience very much anti- Semitism calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Unlike my wife who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> , so they had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , the fact of--<span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was Jewish, where I grew up we had very few Jews, a lot of Polish people, and the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were run by priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And as a kid I experienced, I've been called really all the time Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And you're not--I had bad experience as long as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We had a religious lesson once a week, on Wednesdays, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So all grades Jewish boys would walk together because if you walk singly you get beaten up by other Polish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So we usually walk groups all grades together. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">As a group, you know, we had more power, then nobody would beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That's how, you meet in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> then walk to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I really didn't have good memories living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And my wife and my oldest son and my daughter went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I couldn't go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aushwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I couldn't go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember incident when my father was was stopped by Polish policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He stood in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He took his hat off in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And whatever the Polish policeman said you'd say, "Yes, sir, yes, sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I stood a little boy holding my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I could not, I said to my wife, I could not stand, as a free man, for somebody call me again what they called me originally, so I rather not go because I might get in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  When you became reunited with your cousin and the other surviving family members can you tell me what that reunion was like and what you spoke about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, the cousin who was looking for her husband, they finally got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They were sweethearts before the war and it was quite, you know--as a matter of fact, she lost her husband in the '67 War. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Whenever we come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she is a widow like he died yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">She takes us today to his <span class="DLF">grave</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So that was nice to have somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There was a uncle by marriage but, you know, those days, you know, we kind of kept together. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We needed each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There was a group of people and were organized like a Jewish committee and, as a matter of fact, the Jewish community was the richest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">A small incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">A lady who lived in Richard Wagner's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> went downstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and they found big wooden boxes full of silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So the poor woman has been trying to make a living, was making ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And so she would sell the ice cream with expensive Wagner, Richard Wagner silverware, was one of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But we had a, like a community-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We got together and, you know, we were given from Germans different special treatments like. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They actually, you know, they give you nice <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But unlike other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , people stay in their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they would stay in those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , because when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bayreuth</span> I lived in a nice <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> and everybody has nice <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> so it actually wasn't such a trauma like other people had, where they had been behind <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> and living in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and so for.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  So are you telling me you were never in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The only one, I was in that <span class="BUILDING">women's prison</span> and I couldn't stand because I've seen those bars, I figured that's not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me, and I went down and I met the Polish, Polish soldier from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , spoke Polish and so forth, and then my cousin came in and I moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So I didn't have such a bad experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Did you have any reunions with other people that you met before or during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Definitely yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We--I met a young woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ryswick</span> , and there was no touching. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I, you know, I always was mechanically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I realized when I came first day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> that people with some kind of know-how have more of a chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I was always a kid that was mechanically inclined, always doing, making something and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So I want to describe my first, my first day when I came to the, to that new camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Can I describe my first experience when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I remember when I was, I was--I escaped one time, before they sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I jumped, escaped from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where they kept me before they sent us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I was, I was caught and they put me to the bad <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And ?</span><span class="sentence" id="96">misloyalty? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">put me in <span class="INT_SPACE">solitary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That was the most horrible part of my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Slide you down. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">You can't fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And they serve you food in a bucket down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">There is no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sit down, to stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You just rest your buttocks on the one <span class="NPIP">part</span> they cut out and your knees on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You hear screams all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It's night all the time because there is no sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I don't know how I got through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I--they pulled me up on the chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I really didn't feel sorry for myself but I was thinking about my mother, she should see that I'm walking in my leg chains, and I figured she, she wouldn't believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But instead of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aushwitz</span> they send me to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Resamay</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And my older, my older brother, he came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They sent him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And he was telling me who he knew, who he met, and I remember he was telling about they using a +, Demarek (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But here I am in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , a huge <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , about 10-, 15,000 prisoners, and I see Demarek walking by. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So I yelled out to him, "Herr Demarek." </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He was a German youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="117"><span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">If he remembers we were friends or were on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with my older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He said, "Come sie here, come sie here." </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He came in, took me to his <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , right away gave me a bowl of soup, and he says, "I know a good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , I'll send you." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I didn't know I already was bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There's a guy who called the Lumen. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">This guy was like limping one leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He would buy like blocks of people, like 500 people for different kind of <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I was bought already, sold to him, but he says, "I know a good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , I'll send you." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And he put me on that list. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I remember I came to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , came at night, all the dogs and lights, and 1t was quite an experience coming first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I went next day, they put me in the pick and shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I never held a pick and shovel in my hand, so at the end of the day I had blisters on my hands, and had just blisters here, I had blisters between my fingers, and I knew next day they kill me, they hit you over the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I remember even the company I worked for was Bengera (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So I had a friend, she was actually a friend of my older brother, Wola zu Polska. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I walked over--she worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I walked over to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I says, "Wola, tomorrow will be my last day because they going to kill me, I can't hold a shovel." </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So she knew someone that put me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And they apparently afraid some infectious diseases so they make like a fever and they put some kind of grease on my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And then she said, "Can you do something else?" </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I said, "I will do anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So they looked for steam roll operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I have seen a steam roller operate, I never operated one. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So I came over and the German came in, said, "You a steam roll operator?" </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I says, "Really, I don't know how to operate." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He says, "You must be honest Jew because only Jews only lie." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So he showed me how to use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And that was one nice thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I didn't--I got away from the shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">That's when I realized from then on I must be some kind of value because otherwise you will never go on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">When you stay with a pick and shovel you don't have no chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">At the incident with the steam roller, the steam roller had--like today hard drive brakes--had mechanical brakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I had to push very hard to stop the steam roller and to turn, some turn it to the left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the steam roller is a very heavy piece of machinery and here I go down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , straining myself, pushing the steam roller and trying to make a right turn at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I went straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So the German took the shovel, hit over the wheel and broke the shovel off so he had just a handle, and he kept hitting me as hard as he could and all I could do is put my hands over my head, protect my head, and the guard stood there with a gun just waiting for me to make next--any move. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He kept hitting until he got tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He knocked my front teeth, he knocked my forehead, he knocked my front lip, and I thought I lost an eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The eye was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And next day I came to work like nothing to it, you know, with one eye, and I worked for that company for a while and even the guy who hit me, sometimes he couldn't eat, he'd point out with his eye where he had a piece of bread or something for me to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So you can't figure this thing out. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then we finish the <span class="DLF">road</span> and they build a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So they, they were looking for welders. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So I found somebody who was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He was a welder from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I said, "Will you please show me." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So he showed me how to do weld and I became a welder. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And a good welder. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">When we turn on the steam I had hardly a leak. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was huge big pipes, like three feet in diameter, and you climb on <span class="DLF">ladders</span> and you weld up, you know, like a makeshift <span class="DLF">ladders</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I remember I would lay a bead. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That means it looks like a machine, piece of machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The German always liked my work, the way I laid the bead nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And then they came in and turned on the steam, you know, everybody would get praises or yelled at you because you didn't a good job. </span><span

QUESTION:  And you were telling me about your encounter with the woman that was eventually to become your wife, and I'd like you to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Well, we were separated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rheinsberg</span> , excuse me, and I was sent to the terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I was staying on Sunday, listen to the church bells down the valley, and I was looking at the moon and I was thinking what happened to her, was she alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, it was so cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I realized that I won't be living long so I been volunteering for work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And of course I was sent that time to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And the Allies, unknown to us, were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We were walking nights and resting daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And of course, you know, coming back I was found by someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Now, after my cousin found me we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bayreuth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Helen, in the meantime, coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , following a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> , some former cop, I remember she said she saw me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So she yelled at them, she told them that I am alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So Helen knew I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And then on my trip back somebody said that she was, too, told me that she was alive and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You know, people see each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So the next time I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> they were housing some refugees where used to have <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> for horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They were huge, big <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> like for horses and some people would lay there on the hay or some--I just remember open up the big <span class="DLF">gate</span> and yell, I said, "Helen, Helen." </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Some people there say, "No, nobody here by that name." </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And, anyhow, circumstances got so that Helen found out where I was, so she sent me a note that she is in, right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberhaus</span> , would I like to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">She herself didn't know after all we were engaged or, you know, there was no kissing, no touching, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I tell you, a young person, you know, a young person, even circumstances like this, you think ?</span><span class="sentence" id="241">ank? “</span><span class="sentence" id="242">nolow?. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And so I was away and I came in that weekend and I got dressed and I boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I found somebody who knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And in those days the curfew, all the <span class="DLF">doorways</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> always locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So somebody came with me, and Helen had dropped the key to open the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They say, "You know who is here, follow me." </span><span class="sentence" id="248">She got so excited she couldn't find the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So, anyhow, we met and embraced. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I told her again, I said, "I would like to get married." </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And that watch which I traded for my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> I gave her as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">That was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And we kept on courting ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I had that uncle by marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He left, he left to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Apparently he had some relatives here. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And he didn't think I should get married, that I am too young for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So after he left, I was by myself, I said I'm master of my destiny, so we decided to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Got married in '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And Helen's family had somebody who was strictly Orthodox so I had to run and get pots and pans, Kosher pots and pans, but the sad part, you know, Helen cooked all the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">We didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caterers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And the pots and pans. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And so, and I brought up Helen--I had some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I bought right after the war a big <span class="DLF">junk yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But Helen says, "No, you are not going to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I sold the <span class="DLF">junk yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And I had on, in the <span class="DLF">junk yard</span> a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> from Hermann Goering, burnt up <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And the only thing I pulled out before I sold it, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Hermann Goering car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And the Russians, who would buy anything had four wheels and a steering, so I restored the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I drove up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That was the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And I got a lots of old German marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I came in loaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But that's how we got, we had money to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Because you have to remember, after the war there was no food and anything you had on the rations wasn't enough, so you had to pay a lot of money if you want to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So finally after work, both days we were fasting, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">That's traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Before you get married you fast all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And under the huppah those days the tradition was to take to pray for the dead, which was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We were surviving by the UNRRA, who had given powdered eggs, powdered milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And those days there were, there were <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So what the really funny part of it, what you do first, you jump in the <span class="DLF">line</span> , then you ask what the <span class="DLF">line</span> is for. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Because you actually need everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Sometimes would have toilet paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You get two. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Well, first you get in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You don't want to go in <span class="DLF">line</span> --I was on business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and there is a long <span class="DLF">line</span> , so I jump the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">What's the <span class="DLF">line</span> for? </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The <span class="DLF">line</span> is to register for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So I stood and I registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And sure enough three more--you got to realize, we were liberated there was no <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were closed and, you know, nobody wants to live--after the Pogroms in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> people were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> --nobody wanted to stay in the god forsaken <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so, well, there was nowhere to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There was--President Truman was a great president. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He sign in a law to send in a hundred thousand dispersed persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That doesn't mean just Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There were all kinds nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We came on that <span class="DLF">corridor</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  While you were still in Europe, before I had you coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you mentioned that you got some help from the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Were there any other organizations that offered you any help by way of food assistance or educational assistance or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  We--I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a while, <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> , and I remember we had our teacher from a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> from--he was in <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> completely, he run away from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and he was teaching us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  You want to take a break? (</span><span class="sentence" id="302">Recess taken.)</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  You asked for a break and we're back now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Yeah, actually that was a, organized by the <span class="BUILDING">ORC school</span> , and I had some technical training there. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That helped a lot when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I had some kind of idea about technical work and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And--.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  When did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Labor Day 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">September the 9th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Before I have you leaving Europe and telling about your experiences in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I wanted to ask you about two events that occurred while you were still in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">The Nuremburg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I want to know how closely you followed the Nuremberg trials and what were your thoughts during that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  During the Nuremberg trials I was following closely but somehow I felt that they were given a fair trial but all our people never got any kind of fair trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I felt it wasn't fair for those people who killed millions of people get a fair trial with lawyers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Somehow or other I felt 1t was so unjust that they can, they can have attorneys and they can blame everybody else except themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I was really angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I was following, yes, but I didn't understand American justice then, the American way of life, and I just, I just felt they should be just string up, but that is not the way it is, but at that time I had different kind, I had no idea about justice, you know, because when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we have different kinds of laws and regulations, different kind of way of justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Kind of felt funny for me that they treated them in a nicer manner, nobody gets hit and they get nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Throughout all the time I was angry really that they getting somehow trial, asking questions, they have chance to blame somebody else, not themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Did you feel that justice was served by the Nuremberg trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  I can't even understand how justice could be served. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Actually those people committed the most heinous crimes the world ever knew, that they, men, women, children, and murder them in such a brutal way. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I, I really, I really--even to hang these people wasn't good enough for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">A lot of people blame the older generation, not the younger generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I felt they should suffer for a long time what they did to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Maybe it's not right to blame the younger generation but I just cannot forget, cannot forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  Also while you were still in Europe there was a U.N. debate about the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and also the birth of the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I would like to ask you to reflect upon that experience, those experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  I remember it was announced establishment, 1948, the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I remember as a kid that belonged to Zionist organization talking about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was talking about going to the <span class="NPIP">moon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It was so far away, something I couldn't believe could ever, ever materialize. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was, it was such a, a, such a far away thing to, even to think about that could be possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So when they announce the establishing a State of Israel I'm kind of believe it and didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was such a utopia, you know, the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">How could it be really? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Would the Gentile world allow something like this? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But I myself, when I speak to children, I always tell them even living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we are part of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we have someone we can be proud, they establish and they establish themself with all the technology and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I give them a lot of credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But at that time I decided to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and so, you know, we decide to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , not to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So that's the way we want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="342"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at that time, things were hard to get and so on and I felt I've been through such a horror, maybe I can have a better life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Did you have to take any tests, any medical tests or intelligence tests or anything like that before you could come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I didn't have--only thing I had a bad experience, before we came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> we had to have x-rays, whether have tuberculosis, so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I, apparently I slept with a lot of people with tuberculosis and I had some marks on my lungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">In those days they had like a .35 millimeter small film. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">When I am came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> they saw those and they told me I can't enter <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So I have to go back and make a big blow-up, a big picture, and everybody said wasn't tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And there was a little bit of trauma too because I felt that something happened I can't go, although when you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> your mother take everybody and to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you just could not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  What were your expectations of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  I really--when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we had $20 between us but I, I seen it was a open world and I never felt poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I was, I had so much zest to work and I felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I came to the Jewish Refugee Service Agency, which was a great thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">That's one of my favorite, favorite charities. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They really, it really means a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">A child, like Jewish Refugee Service Agency, when you come they gave me, everyone, they gave me $30 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It's such an enormous thing when youcome, Ihave —_—._ </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And after three months I could not take anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I wasn't raised that way and I said I need a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I went on construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And I worked pronto. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Everybody liked my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">As a matter of fact, later on I became a journeyman, a journeyman, plumbing journeyman. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here and I became a master plumber here. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But when I was German I used to run the big jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I was the foreman, the foreman of the job, and I met some people was building <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And those days <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were like $16,000 which was to me a mountain of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So was great and sitting and talking to the builder I said, you know, Mr.--name was Berman (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I said, "You know, Mr. Berman, I never build before a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like that, $16,000, my God." </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So he says, "You know," I says, "I'm start building a new, new part of my building experience and I will always make sure that you get a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I remember he came in, showed me the blueprints, "Pick any <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you like." "</span><span class="sentence" id="373">Well, I'll take a lot." </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He said, "I'll make sure that you have a down payment." </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He gave me a slip of paper that I gave a down payment, but actually he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He did not give salesman's commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He gave me his commission rather than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And the plumbing company let me do my own plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I did my own plumbing in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so I had a certain discount on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Then I even didn't have any labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I dug my own <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and my wife and my oldest son were holding the light till midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I was doing my own plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I have so much zest, I want to have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">That was a big thing, I felt, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> money talks. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So I became a master plumber, I couldn't get financing.
