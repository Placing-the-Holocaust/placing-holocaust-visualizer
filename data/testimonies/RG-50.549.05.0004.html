<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Did the Jews in the lager and the Gypsies generally interact with one another? </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Talk to one another?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  We spoke, yeah, we spoke, but that is it, as far as it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">In the first few days, we were in quarantine. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We didn’t go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">You were afraid to go far. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They catch you....But yes, you get to talk to some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They said their son is on the front, works for the Germans, makes ditches, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  And then you described how you started working with the Canada commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I wondered how it was that you got that position, because that was a somewhat coveted position.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  No, nobody wanted it, nobody wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Usually when you stand, you know, I worked that time before I worked in <span class="INT_SPACE">katowe bunker</span> (ph), you know, where the potatoes was. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And you had to, there was two people, one in front and one in the back and then they filled it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">You lift it up and you go to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, and filled it, put it in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Because mostly when they came with the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> , they dumped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I knew one thing, there was always selection going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">There was selection to go in the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> if you didn’t look good or if they didn’t like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">13 So, you always watched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Your eyes went the right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Somehow I missed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">He was standing in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And he said, write down here the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You know, my number what I got right here on my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He wrote it down and they called me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I didn’t know where we'll go. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You know, nobody wanted to work in two different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Sonderkommando, where what the people burned them, you know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , where you take the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You told them, “Oh you will live, and it’s nothing,” whole kind of thing, “Take off, when you come out, you will find it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="535">You know, we had to take it away, and they sold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">But this meant a certain death, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Say, sonderkommando maybe three months, the other one may be six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Well, it’s interesting to hear you say that nobody wanted it, because I’ve heard other people say that it was, that they would try to get a position, because you would have advantages of clothing and food and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Now, you had advantages, but you didn’t want to, because you knew that you would be dead, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And you always have that little hope, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They did not, they picked you, you didn’t pick them. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They picked me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I said, “Oh,” you know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">No, I didn’t like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I had a little bit of food, but then I had to watch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Somebody would see me shoving it down my mouth, they would kill me, and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But in a way, this food helped, but I didn’t want to, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It’s like nobody wanted for the Sonderkommando.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Did you have friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Friends what I knew only, I met them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Friends, but I slept with them, but no, you did not have friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">You didn’t have nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">What binded with them, they all had a miserable life, but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">No, I did not have nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Some brothers stayed together, or even high management maybe stayed . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Somehow I, I got away somehow.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  No, I felt later on when I saw all the deaths, that he was watching over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">In fact, the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I always ask, you know, “Why me, oh Lord?” </span><span class="sentence" id="567">You know, to have suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And a lot of people, you know, they was weak, they grabbed the electric wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">If I had guts I would have done it, but I have no guts to doit. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Later when I see so many dead, I say probably God was watching over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">This is what saying about God.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  And I was a little confused about what happened next. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I heard something... either you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> or you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krauwinkle</span> (ph)?</span></p>

I couldn’t walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They had to teach me how to walk and to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blankenheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Ironically, now let’s go farther, one of the doctors, Doctor Lucas, I met him later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and he was head from <span class="BUILDING">TB hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I had TB, so we became really close friends, you know, he always took care. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I remember when he met this girl and he want... you know, he told me, everyone around. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">There was a bond because he saw how I was.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  I say the German was responsible, but I didn’t say that every German killed or a German hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Fact is, you know it, 1t was their , you know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But I think there’s some good and some bad in every <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And I believe, first, life is too short to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Secondly, I believe if I teach my kids to hate, somebody will hate them and it is a vicious cycle. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">The cycle has to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And my mother always told me, “You know Abe, if somebody throws a rock at you, throw them bread back. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Take a piece of bread and throw them back, don’t hate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You know, so I... even when I was liberated, I wanted to tell my story, but I didn’t hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">It’s wrong to hate, I can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I think that people what hate, they are born... as you see now in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , they take kids, for two year, throw them down , and the training, and the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It takes a special person, but everybody can do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  What was his point of view that he shared with you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  Did you have friends or acquaintances who were Jewish, at that time, who couldn’t understand why you would want to be friends?</span></p>
