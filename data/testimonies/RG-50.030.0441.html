<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Establishments. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Because some or most of that, some of them, because the Germans and the Romanians had left, so most of these owners who stayed were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And quite a number of them were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Quite a number of them were sent, this was already in June of 1941, a few weeks before the war broke out.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Of, of Jewish population of 60 thousand, approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was tempted to go as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Quite a number of my friends went, but we were treated badly by the Russian leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Say, the, when we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the last day, they gave authorizations to, authorizations of evacuations to all the Russians who came from the Soviet Union but wouldn’t give any to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I was afraid, at not myself just with some friends, that we would go and they wouldn’t even let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We were afraid of the Germans coming here, here as, as occupiers but plus, at that time, I was already in love with Lotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She said, she said, “I never would leave my family, either.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And so we stayed and waited for a few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  What happened when the Romanians and the Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">What happened to the Jews?</span></p>
