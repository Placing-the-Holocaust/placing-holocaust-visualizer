<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What are some of your earliest memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Basically they start with when I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we lived in there was no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1935, and for the first year, the first six months I would say, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then the edict came down that Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, and I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my grandmother lived, and I had to go and live with my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Couldn’t live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In order to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I moved there and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  And the name of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linnich</span> , L-i-n-n-i-c-h. And it was a -- maybe 45 minutes or an hour’s ride away. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I don’t think I was a happy camper, but being with my grandmother and not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there for a -- for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then my -- my aunt and uncle also lived with my grandmother and they October 17, 2001 emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And my grandmother went to live with another daughter and I had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I then went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , which was a half hour, 45 minute train ride or bus ride from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So I commuted every day as a eight, nine year old, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , on my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  What kinds of things did you study?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I was in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I had -- we had all Jewish studies and also all secular studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I went there through what you would call here, maybe fourth or fifth grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  When you were a child going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what did you want to be when you grew up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  I really didn’t know, but I was always playing around with the thought of being a pediatrician, but it never went any further than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But I do have to backtrack and tell you that I was a feisty little girl, and coming off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> one day there was this snotty little kid that called me dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I went after him and beat him to pulp. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And after I had done that I got scared and I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And between the <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span> and where we lived, one of my father’s cousins lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So I ran to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But he got his dues for calling me dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He never called me dirty Jew again. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I must have been eight or nine years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Do you remember other episodes of anti-Semitism? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">October 17, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes, very vividly after Kristallnacht in 1938, we had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> where three uncles and an aunt, brothers and sisters, all of whom were unmarried, lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And it was like a two or three bedroom apartment and I don’t know how -- remember how many people piled in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But now I was supposed to walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I think most days I did, but the teachers thought my Hebrew education was sadly lack-lacking, and suggested that I have some extra lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And my mother arranged for me to have them after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Inevitably the teacher would call and ask where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And my mother said, well isn’t she there? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And no, she’s not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I was roaming the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and there were all these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> that had the signs in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , Juden [indecipherable], meaning Jews not wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And that’s the <span class="DLF">line</span> I would stand on, and they were selling coffee with an eighth of a pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And my grandmother, my mother’s mother, was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">She had cancer, and her only joy was a cup of coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So many afternoons I would come -- I would have stood on five, six <span class="DLF">lines</span> and I would have come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a pound of coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That’s where I was, standing on <span class="DLF">line</span> somewhere or taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and going to a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and pick up a piece of cake for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But I never told anybody where I was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was just roaming the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I -- I always got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">October 17, 2001
QUESTION:  Before Kristallnacht, did you experience any other anti-Semitic verbal or physical attacks on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  N-No. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There was a lot of discussion at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> between the adults, but they tried to shield the children from it, so really, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  When you say they tried to shield you, how did they shield you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  By not talking about any of their problems in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was always hush hush. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And that’s why I have so few memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Were you aware that something was wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Yes, we always lived in fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We didn’t have a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We didn’t go on vacations, we didn’t go on picnics, we didn’t go to the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It was not a normal life as you would know it here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Did your family ever think of leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , even if -- I’m talking about before Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Yes, my father very much wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he did have a visa application number y -- that everybody had to have, a quota number. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But the quota numbers were very, very high for Germans at that time, and there was very little hope for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We were working on it, but it didn't go as fast as you think it would. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">October 17, 2001
QUESTION:  In the time before KristallInacht, do you remember any book burnings, or do you remember any of the -- w -- you’re shaking your head, I can’t -- I can’t pick that up on the microphone.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that comes to your mind about the period of time before Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Very vague, small things that I really can’t put together to make any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Were you able to see or hear anything on Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Oh yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I -- my parents, living outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , and I don’t think radios were very much in use at that time, sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the way I usually did and when I got to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the -- the Gestapo or police, I don’t remember, I ca -- I still can’t tell the difference between one and the other, were standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with German Shepherds. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And they told us, children there is no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> today, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was right next door to a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and we could see that the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burnt out. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my October 17, 2001 mother said, well, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I said, well, th-they sent us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They said there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It must have been 11 - 12 o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That time my uncle had a very good school friend who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and said to my family, whatever you see or hear today, do not leave your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Just don’t leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">In other words, he must have known what was going to happen and he told my uncle not to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So, around three, four o’clock in the afternoon we hear that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is burning, the fire engines ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We saw the smoke from the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My cr -- grandfather had been president of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for over 20 years and th -- his natural thing was to run to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to save the books, to save the Torahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But my father and uncle would not let him leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And we saw all this and we decided -- my grandmother at that time had a broken ankle, so her leg was 1n a cast. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So my parents decided it was time to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Every other Jewish male in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we lived in, ran to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They were all picked up and put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My parents and my uncle and three cousins who lived in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over, all decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">These are all the people that filed into this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And a non-Jewish man drove us, my grandparents, my sister and I, drove us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We had to sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and we were sitting on my grandmother’s cast. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We were not allowed to look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And he drove us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and that’s how we left, my parents, October 17, 2001 uncle, went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over to pick up another aunt and uncle and my grandmother, who was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we also came -- they also came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And when the man that drove us came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived, he was severely beaten for having driven us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">In that way there were many people that were very close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My grandfather was a very well-respected man. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He did business 1n -- all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He helped many people, he loaned them money, he set them up in business, Jews and non-Jews, and he was very well respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">As a matter of fact, when we went back this past summer, we went to a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , and I think the lady that lives in the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> now is the granddaughter of the man that ran my parent’s business from 1933 to ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He was, of course, a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Jews weren’t allowed to do business, and turned over all the funds to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And this lady invited us for coffee, and she also has these vague memories of things that -- my grandparents never spoke about it, a -- because my family’s <span class="REGION">grazing lands</span> abutted the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> ’s property, and they must have been very, very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Was trying to remember, there was something I wanted to say before and I forgot it of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  What kind of business was your grandfather in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Same business. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">What -- what -- the business consisted of my uncle and his -- my father and his brother, my uncle; and three cousins that were also brothers, had the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> -- were in business together where my uncle would go to <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span> to October 17, 2001 buy cattle, have it transported by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="REGION">Cologne area</span> , put it in this <span class="REGION">pastureland</span> or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> , and then sell the | -- cattle to the dealers -- to the farmers in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">S -- and my grandfather had that business and my father and uncles took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And the three brothers and the two brothers, were always in business together. [</span><span class="sentence" id="151">coughing]. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  After Kristallnacht, what was next for you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Well, we piled into this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my father, his brother and one of the cousins were terrified about being picked up and put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So for three or four nights they would sleep during the day and drive through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> at night in order not to be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The only thing they did was stop for gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They did this for -- well, Kristallnacht was on a Thursday, they did it Friday during the day, Friday night was Shabbat and they stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> shab -- and they were hiding, because the m -- there were very few men around of their age. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they started doing this again Sunday, and I think Monday and Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And then they tried to go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And of course they were caught and sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And tried -- a day or so later they tried again and they managed to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , but were picked up by Dutch police that were friendly to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And they informed the Nazis and they put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They were imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And as I said earlier, my uncle and aunt had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">October 17, 2001 And with the assistance of highly prominent people in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , that had connections to the queen, etcetera, they were able to arrange that they were not being sent -- that they would not be sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So -- and they were put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was kind of like restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They were not allowed out, but they were not in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And they were there from November ’38 to May 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We did not see my father in all that time, we had no contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And my mother then handled -- my mother and my aunts handled all the emigration things because after Kristallnacht, they m -- the Jews were told that they had to go and clean up the mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And my mother went back and she looked at it and she said, I'll never do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The Persian carpets were on the manure heap. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The prayer books were full of eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We still have some of them -- show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And it was very, very difficult, but many -- not many, but several of the non-Jewish families came to her aid and helped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And of course, food was very difficult to obtain at that time, and the people from the <span class="REGION">land</span> would come with baskets to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> to bring us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">As a matter of fact, they knew we would only eat kosher chickens, one woman came every week with a live chicken on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And two of my uncles were Shochten, they had learned that, so that way we had our kosher chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You see, we -- we weren’t -- we really did not any -- have any deprivations in that way, because people helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">October 17, 2001

<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Well, she didn’t do it alone, there was her sister, the cu -- and two cousins, and one of my unc -- two of ma -- of the cousin -- two of the three brothers that were cousins were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so they all had -- worked on it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But you have to remember, we had a 17 room <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It was fully furnished, that you could find on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Linens, clothing, everything in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was smashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">There wasn’t a single piece that was left together. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And at that time my mother went and bought a complete ha -- n-new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , dishes, pots, pans, housewares, linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">She bought everything new. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">She knew she was not allowed to take out any money when she left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And everything she bought had to be paid to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , had to be documented, and the same amount of money had to be paid to the German government for export tax. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I would say 75 percent of the stuff that she bought was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> when the British bombed it 1n the -- in the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I think if you look at the bottom, you’ll still find it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So I would say 75 percent of the stuff she bought never -- never got to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Why <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  It’s a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="195"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> wouldn’t let us in and my -- one of the cousins was married to a woman who had a cousin who had, | think studied law in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">October 17, 2001 And he was hired by the Kenya government as an attorney in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he -- and it was still relatively easy to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And he sent affidavit for 17 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">At the time, I think you had to deposit 50 pounds per person as an entry fee. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And after the war started -- we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> on June first, the war started September first. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">After the war started that fee was up to 250 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But we were lucky, we got in. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My father and uncles went -- got there four weeks earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They went from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We went from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ship</span> that served us kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Talk about being ironic.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  What did it mean for you, for your family, to be enemy aliens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  They laughed about it because it was so iro -- ironic. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The -- the thing that it real - that it meant physically was, my parents bought a very, very large <span class="DLF">farm</span> in -- a <span class="DLF">ranch</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And what it came down to was we were interned on the <span class="REGION">property</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">October 17, 2001 We were not allowed to leave the <span class="REGION">property</span> without permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Any time we wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- every week we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nairobi</span> , which was 20 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We lived in the highlands in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limuru</span> , we had to go buy groceries. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We had to go to the police department and get permission to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nairobi</span> and buy groceries. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And -- but otherwise it was not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But in the beginning, when we -- when war broke out, everybody was very upset and we were then declared enemy aliens and the British came with the A-African soldiers to arrest my -- all the men that had now come to freedom in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> , were arrested, including my 80 year old grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And they were taken to a place of internment for security. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And my grandmother at that point said to the British whoever he was, police officer, she said, now I want you to know something. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We fled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to safety, to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I have been married to this man for 45 years and where he goes, I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So if you’re going to take my 80 year old husband, I’m going to go with him, he’s not going to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He looked at my grandmother, he says, okay, we’ll leave him here. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And the men were there one or two nights and they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They realized what was going on and looked into their background and they were released. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We were, at that time, still living 1n a ho -- in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that my father had rented in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nairobi</span> , and that was before we had purchased the <span class="DLF">ranch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Afterwards, they made it October 17, 2001 mandatory that the men help the war effort, and manage the ranches of the British that had gone to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">My uncle became a manager of a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">That’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">No, this was during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I’m sure they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I’m sure they did, but I don’t think 1t became a -- any trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Did anybody there ask you about your life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ” October 17, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes, many in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There was a nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nairobi</span> and people that had been there 20 - 30 years, and yes they did ask us. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But we were absorbed into the community, it was really -- living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nairobi</span> was very, very pleasant.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I don’t think my parents had that intention because there was basically no Yiddishkeit. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">There were no -- there were no -- I don’t think there were any other Orthodox Jews, except one or two families that had also come as immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And again, it was very difficult to keep any of the observance. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So after the war my father was anxious to leave, so that we -- that the children could at least be integrated into an Orthodox community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> that was there -- you said it was a -- it was a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , where were those people from and what kinds of traditions did they follow?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  On your second trip, the one that was not structured, ho-how did you -- how were you treated by the people that you met?</span></p>

QUESTION:  I have to ask you about a Torah scroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You have not mentioned it, but I would like you to tell me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  Oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">The two cousins that stayed behind to the very end were able to purchase a -- that -- a Torah scroll that was saved from one of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and they brought it to <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">In <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> we used it because we had services on the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The family had five adult males and during the war my mother ha-had many, many Jewish soldiers, from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , from <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that would come for rest and recuperation to our <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And so for the holidays they always kept -- if they were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> , we’d always come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And the Torah scroll was used in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">When we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a Torah scroll was used in a small <span class="BUILDING">country synagogue</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brockmanville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And when we left the <span class="REGION">area</span> , we took the Torah scroll with us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It is not kosher any more, it cannot be used as as -- Torah scroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So not knowing what to do with it, not wanting to bury it, we donated it as a gift to <span class="BUILDING">KMS synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> , who gratefully accepted it and built a beautiful orann for it, and it s-stands in their bet-hamek in the small <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and it is taken out once a year on Simchas Torah, when everybody dances with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And I feel that 1s a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> for it because it’s still being used for what it was intended for. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">October 17, 2001

<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I may have mentioned this before, that we wi -- feel very fortunate to be alive and to be able to live in freedom in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to raise our children to be Orthodox Jews, and to be able to spend our later years of -- being to some advantage to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> of being able to do the translations, even though they are very, very difficult at times to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And some Mondays we come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> quite depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But then life goes on and things get better.</span></p>
