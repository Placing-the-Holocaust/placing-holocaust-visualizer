<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't remember much <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I was, I think I went only to a first grade, and then the war started, so I don't remember anything about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I don't think that I was in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> more than a, more than a few months, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  What about Jewish observance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  It's a combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Look, my mother was born to Hertzog (ph) family, which as you know is a religious family. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And my grandfather was with Koftan (ph), black, uh, but he was a modern one. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He had a company that dried peanuts, was a wealthy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My father came from an academic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">His sisters were all learned, learned people. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">His brother- in-law was one of the most famous violinists in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So there was a combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I don't know if we kept kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But there was a combination of my mother who came from a very religious family and probably she did not keep that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because she married a man that was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">If we kept kosher, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We had a non-Jewish maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I don't know, I don't know if we were kosher or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Was the family Zionistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Oh, oh, oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Very much so! </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My father visited <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and, uh, my father was a very charitable person, very well known in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">When Hitler started to throw out the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he opened a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and he gave hot meals to the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That I do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My father was a very charitable person, not only because he had a wonderful heart, but I think in his position he had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I do remember that in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> Jabotinsky was in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I didn't know who he was, but I know now that I live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who Jabotinsky was. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">You know, he was a Zionist, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">If you call it Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Today, I am not so sure that you can call a Zionist that lives outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but if you call it, yes, he was a Zionist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  What do you remember about what happened to you and your family and friends when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  About friends, I don't remember anything about friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I didn't have any friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father escaped and, uh, he escaped with, uh, most important people, Beck, President Beck, and so on, through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We endured the worst, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , but he managed to take us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And we ran away and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , we were together and the short time before Hitler entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> too, and when Hitler occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , my father, there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and, uh, the Sturmfuhrers entered, and said, Victor Goldstein?" </span><span class="sentence" id="62">and he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They took us all out and in, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they shot him and said, "You were a Jewish journalist and Zionist," and took out a revolver and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And that was the end of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And soon, there was, uh, and soon there was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">If I remember very well, the scene of the death of my father was that my mother cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Did I cry? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I don't know what, I didn't know what death was. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I probably cried only because I saw my mother cry, and this is so far away from me that I really don't know my feelings as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I was so small, but we entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> and we were with my sister and brother til the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Can you describe the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  The life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I can better describe than other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You know in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">What we did, we didn't learn much in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , we were, we learned how to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I know all the Yiddish songs from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I sang them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I have a record with all those songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I have done it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So I knew all the songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But you have to understand that the Jewish children did not have the right to live, so a few times in the week they came to take out the children, so the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , and we were given brown paper and pencils to keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, if you can call it a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I wouldn't call it, but 1t was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the children came, and every day less and less children came because the children were taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and put in, and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So less and less children were in those <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> , if you call them <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But I was lucky, and I stayed until the end, and during some days, my mother did not send me because we had to eat and there was, and horse meat was very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There was no other meat, so she would send me to sell cigarettes and matches on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And as I was a good looking child, people had pity on me so they bought matches and cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">One day I remember, I got beaten up by mother because I gave the money to two children that were helping me and they were they said, they told me that they are hungry and they will help me sell the cigarettes and they were screaming, "Buy from her, the cigarettes, and not from somebody else," so we sold everything and I had money, so I gave them money. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mamma, mother gave me on my tushie (ph) because she said, "Well, now with what will be buy the horse meat?" </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And the horse meat was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was a delikatesse, this horse meat, and she always said if he don't have the money, we won't eat meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, days in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , look, it was different in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> than it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , (a) Because we were still stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We had more food, but we lived a frightened life, a very frightened life. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don't remember much laughter, much smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">First of all, my mother was already a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My sister, who married in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Zunder Leizersohn, who was one of the first partisans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He was smuggling out the people to the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the, how do you say, _____, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and on the last trip of his he wanted to take my sister with him and they were caught, and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So I do remember that having two widows in this, in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which we lived, and my sister loved this man very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember he was a very good looking man, and she was 10 years older than me and it was a tragic that he was killed while wanting to take her out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So to live with a mother that cried about her husband and with a sister that cried about her husband in a, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was no much happiness, so, but that was already the wonderful time, because after that it came only the terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So if I look back to the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it was paradise towards what happened to me afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So therefore I feel that when I speak about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> , because I was very short time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , I first of all, you know, you get brain washed a little bit, that this 1s your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And as a child, I didn't know that there was a different life. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I didn't understand why, why are we suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, you know, I suppose that for the people that had been much more grown up and much older than me, life was probably unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I didn't have sleepless nights from being afraid what would happen to me tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I suppose that my mother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as a child, I learned a lot of songs and there were children to play, still, and so I would played, and in the nights, my mother would put me in the, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because she was afraid the Germans came, come in and, uh, uh, would take us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We were, uh, taught not to be loud. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">When we were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> we hardly spoke to each other because we were explained that if you speak the Germans would come and kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So as children we were taught to do things which normal children outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wouldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But it was happy, because I have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I didn't have one. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Nobody talked to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We were playing, we were playing with stones (cough), excuse me, we were playing with, you know, like little stones, to, uh, we were singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Was terrible, but it was terrible, but it was not so terrible as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Can you sing one of the songs for us? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">One you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  I remember many songs, but I am not comfortable to sing a song which has to do like a song which I have sang Polish (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="120">If I translate it: "Buy from me the cigarettes, only from me because they are not wet from rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Buy from me and have pity on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Polish (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Buy from me because I am an orphan." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Those were very said songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The songs that were, the majority of the songs of the Holocaust were written in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> had the <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span> , and the majority of the songs were written there, and I know them from that, and I hope that one day you will come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and there is a record which I have done when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , His Master's Voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But then, you know, I was 19 years old and I wanted to do that to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So I had this song and another song which I sang, and the record was_____——_—sridevel and ____, which was also very famous song of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">SSCS Which =waass also written for the Vilna, __. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Those are the songs that I have learned in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I have not sang them anymore, because I am a happy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I have wonderful songs now to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So, but, if we talk about it, yah, those were the songs that I have been singing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the deportation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the dates of the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Anyhow dates I couldn't tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It wouldn't be real if I tell you, but it was the liquidation of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> and they took us out and there was a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There was the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and there was the left side, and naturally my sister and my brother were on a different, with the men, my mother and my sister on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I was put on the left <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Little did I know that the left side is death, but I didn't want to be alone without them. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So with all the screaming which went on, and there was screaming going, because I have seen that woman was holding a baby in her hand and she was screaming not to, the German wanted to take away the baby and put her on the right side, so she was screaming that way that he took the baby and threw it on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the baby died in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That is in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I saw that I don't want to be without my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So there was so much confusion and I was such a little girl that I ran way without anyone seeing it to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I found my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And from there we went to, we were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald-Riga</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald-Riga</span> , my memory takes me to a very terrible scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We already knew, I mean, we already knew, even the children that there are <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And they took us and they undressed us and they said we have to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Not <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">for the people already knew the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> are not showers, but gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I became so hysterical that I said to my mother and that I vividly remember, "You can die. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You are old. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I still want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Don't let me go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I don't want to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And she wanted to calm me down and she said, "No, it's not to be to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It's just to wash." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I couldn't listen to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I throw myself on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="158">I am not going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You are old. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You can die. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I don't want to die." </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But anyhow, we had to go in, and my memory takes me that I was so hysterical that I really, when they put on the water saw that this is not water, but this was water. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We had to wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We had to wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They gave us soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We had to wash, and we got our establishing dresses, those clothes with, how do you call them, in German stripe. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">That what I remember, and then the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We were deported from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinenwerke</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinenwerke</span> we were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">As I understand now by being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was a 100,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I never realized that it was such a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And there I was with my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">What did we do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">There was no work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , but they let us work. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They took us from, you had to carry stones from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You had to fill bags of cement and carry them on your shoulder to the other corner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Very little food, very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And slowly, slowly, my mother was dying from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">She was not even a human being anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">She was such a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Had big eyes and such blue under her eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">No hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">If I loved her, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Because she was not a mother anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">She was a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And then one day when we were lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and somebody came to say that your mother died, go and say to her goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I turned my head and I saw they slapped her to this corner where all the dead were and I said this is not my mother, and I didn't even want to say goodbye to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I was left with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And still I had my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It wasn't so bad, because she was young and she warmed me up and I don't know if I missed my mother so much because now that I reason to myself, there was no much love that a child felt and I myself am a mother, and I understand in this circumstances, where you see your own children dying from hunger and crying, "Mother, I am hungry," and she couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So what kind of love. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Everybody was to himself, and her thoughts I don't know, but I am intelligent enough to understand today that she was suffering, seeing her two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">If she gave us a piece of bread, I don't even remember if she gave us her piece of bread, because the piece of bread that we got was very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And how unselfish can a person be when he is dying from hunger to give the last piece of bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I don't remember if I got from her a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The fact is that she died from hunger and I didn't, so she might probably have given sometimes to me her piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And from then on it was just slowly dying because I had typhoid, there were hours we were both sitting and taking the lice, that we all had lice all over, and the scratching all night long, the scratching that what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">You scratched yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They were biting you and you took it like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I must saw sometimes I did get sandwich from a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I must say that sometimes I did get a sandwich from a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Sometime, they did have pity on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Sometimes I got beaten up because I couldn't pick up cement, you know, but I must say to the world today, and this is what I always say and this is what I continue to say, "I don't trust the Christian world anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="204">For me, I cannot separate the Germans and the Polacks and the Bulgarians from the Christian world. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I cannot separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It maybe will take another 50 years that I will trust the non-Jewish people, because where were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Do you know how many times in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> I was spit on me, there were spitting because I had the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Has nothing to do with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">How many time did I hear the word in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Jude, which means Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I was asked by your media people sometimes, "How do I feel to the Christians?" </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And I would say always, "Yah, today I am 57 years old, 58. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I know that there are good people and bad people, but I will never forgive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I'll never forgive them that they didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">That the world did not do anything to save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And I don't know why the hatred for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I have never done anything wrong in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Not before and not now! </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I feel I am the same as them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I'll never forgive that, the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Never forgive the Americans for not doing anything and never forgive the world for standing by and seeing that I was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">No, and my sitting here is because I do want that the people should know. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I do want that the people should know that although the world is beautiful and although today they try sometimes to fight against prejudice, I as Dora Roth will never forgive the Christian world for not doing enough and not doing so that I should have not had to suffer 6 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">This is why I live therefore in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I have chosen to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as a 13 year old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">When I went into the <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> and they asked me where do you want to go, which <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> do you want to go, to a Zionistic one or to an <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> which stays in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I didn't understand what Zionism was, but I said I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because I want to be surrounded by Jewish people and not by Christians because I did not trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Until today, I fight my own feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">That's true, because I have seen good Christian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we have a <span class="DLF">Righteous Avenue</span> for all the Christians that have saved the Jews, but I myself I fight this feeling because it is not good to generalize. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But I suffered so much, looked to stand in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and I was the third one to stand and my sister was put there and two Germans looked at me and said, "Look at this beautiful Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Rotten Jewish Child. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Ferfluchte (ph) is rotten in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She has such beautiful eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She shouldn't die yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Took me out and said, "Roth, get out." </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And my sister, knowing where she was going, made with her hands so I shouldn't follow her. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">She died. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And you know what, how can you even today, when you go back to that moment, how can you believe that someone has the right to save me because of my beautiful eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">This is only what I had? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Only beautiful eyes? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I was a human being, a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Hadn't done anything wrong!? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So my feelings to the Christian world is not, is not the best, and probably I'll die that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Is not that I would do any harm to anyone, and if a child would be hungry on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I certainly wouldn't ask him, "Are you Jewish or non-Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="246">That's not with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I would give the child, whoever the child is. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But we are speaking here, you are speaking to me because you want my feelings to, and my story to tell to people that will live after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So this is my feelings and I am not ashamed to say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">This is how I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I don't have anyone except my brother who is not ready to talk about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">He 1s just closed up to this topic. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You can never ask my brother about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">It is taboo in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He doesn't even ask me how my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So it's me that talks about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">My life afterwards was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Although I was shot by a German in the last day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , before the war finished they got an order to go into the <span class="BUILDING">bararacks</span> and to shoot everybody that is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It was in the morning I got 2 bullets in my back with machine gun, but the Russians came a few hours later and saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was operated four times. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They couldn't find the second bullet, but they did afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> but in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I got high fever and I developed double tuberculosis, and I, all the children went, and I had to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marano</span> , first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grupino</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> which the Nuns had and then to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> and I stayed 3 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had a pneumothorax of my left side, to push the lungs so that it shouldn't breath on its own. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And, in 1952, I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and married a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Unfortunately, my husband died from cancer 11 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We have two children, Alreet, she is 33, a criminologist; Donny, 27, he is, he finished the Army, he finished the studies, cinematography, communication and media. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And I have 2 grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I have a 7 year old grandchild and a 2 year old grandchild, and my son-in- law is a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We live very nicely in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I love my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I became a fund raiser. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I fund raise for the United Jewish Appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I am a fund raiser in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I dedicated my life to the Jewish people and I do it already since 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I enjoy my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I enjoy very much living. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And just to tell you that I don't hate, there was a program in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they asked people that speak German to invite German children to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I put my name on it, and I had 2 German children in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I have 2 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So, I can tell you that they week that they have been was not easy because every time we talked I thought to myself maybe their grandfather was the one to put my sister in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Yet, I have done it because I felt that with hatred, and I really mean it, you will not go far. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I remember so many times hurting from the non-Jewish people, You are feshtunken Jude (ph), you stinking Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So when those two German children were in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as I am a very, very, very clean person to the extent my children were suffering, I always said, "Well, did you, did you have a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And they said to me, "Oh, Dora, you don't have to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> every day." </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The German children, and I said, "No, you don't" Oh, I think you do." </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And then I didn't want to let them know that I felt they have to understand that I am very peculiar on that, so I said to them, "But, you know, there was a time that the German people said that we stink, we Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Now smell, Donny and Alreet. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Do we smell differently than you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Then I was sorry that I said it because it is not the children's fault what happened and I was very happy that they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I am sure they were talking to their parents or if they had still grandparents that this was a normal family with normal children with no stinking and no smelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We laughed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I showed them <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and it was my way of saying, "I don't hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I really don't." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">My way of saying maybe if everybody would do that in the world, there wouldn't be the hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But I myself am not a normal person as all of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I look at life differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">With all that, I had a wonderful life, a wonderful 26 year marriage, I have started, I have never been in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I have 2 new university degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I have achieved really the maximum one can achieve in such circumstances that I have been left when I was only 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was 7; I came out to the free world, I was over 17 because I was also 3 years in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So I really achieved the maximum one can achieve. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But in my, deep in my heart, I do, when I walk on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and see the smiling people, sometimes I say to myself, "Where were you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I carry that and my days today I enjoy things much more powerful than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I enjoy to open the <span class="DLF">window</span> in my <span class="DLF">garden</span> , in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and see the blue sky. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I live in a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with lots of flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I enjoy everything around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I enjoy tremendously the beautiful things in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I enjoy <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I go to concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Maybe I enjoy too much because I just want to have it, what I didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">People ask me what kind of a mother was I. Over protective? </span><span class="sentence" id="313">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I said often the children said, "Mother, show a little bit more love." </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Because I said well, if they said I have a headache or I have temperature, I would say, "Uh, that's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It will go away." </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I feel that I was a very good mother, but not over protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I have never told my children my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They didn't want to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">My children don't want to hear about the Holocaust, and I try to not to talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I do speak to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> children in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and here. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But my own children would like to see a normal mother and the Israeli children don't think that the Holocaust was such a great heroism. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I always thought that I was a great hero, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , no, they don't want to know that their mother was once hungry, that their mother was once saw the most terrible rape. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They don't want to hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, to tell a life of 6 years to someone like you is very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It's very difficult to tell you the story from day | til the end, chronologically, because (a) there are many things which I don't remember and many things which I don't want to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But I understand that one has to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">If I am almost the youngest, then probably soon you won't have anyone to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But I don't think that it's possible or feasible or you name it, to go back to everyday life and I see my 7 year old grandchild. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The other day I called her up and she said, "Bring me a pair of glasses with birds on it." </span><span class="sentence" id="332">You know, I am talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I said ____, what do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She said, "Grandmother, you have to bring me a pair of glasses, American glasses, with birds on it." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">7 years old! </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And I said to myself, "How wonderful it is to be 7 years old and to want glasses with birds." </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And while talking to you I say to myself, "What did I want when I was 7 years old." </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And therefore it is so very difficult for me to put it together, you know, and to say, well, on Sunday, I did this, on Monday, I did this, and year after year. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It wouldn't be even real, because I don't remember, I don't want to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I want the Holocaust behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I have lived, since 1952 that I married, I lived a very normal life, a very happy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I said yes to talk, because I feel it is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I try to be real, but how real can one be in telling a story that I was hungry, when today I am on a diet. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Really!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Can you pick up on particular incidences such as the mass rape that you witnessed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Yes, we were punished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> for, I still had my mother and sister then, and then we were punished for 3 women escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You know, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> lately, and I saw the wires, the electric wires, and it was a flashback to this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I don't understand how they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I really don't because the electric wires were not always on, but when they saw someone very near or when they saw someone that wants to touch them, they put it on and they were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Now, how those three women escaped electric wires, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They couldn't find them, and we were punished, 12 hours naked in cold weather, and additional punishment was they took out 4 or 5 and I don't remember how many women, and 1n front of all the women that we stood in a row, you know, they raped in a rape that I have never read or seen it, not in a movie and not on the television, and certainly you can say that we have a terrible television with all kinds of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And to see those young women raped by the men there with sticks, and my mother was near me and she took her hand and put on my eyes, I shouldn't see for the first time sexual intercourse. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I have never seen sexual intercourse. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I remember in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> of my parents was far away from my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I have never heard anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I have never seen anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And I was too small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I never dated. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">This was not the ages of, I wasn't of the age to date. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So to see that, I understand that my mother didn't want me to see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Why did she hope that I will be alive and probably she thought if I see it, maybe I will be shy of men or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But the men, the Germans saw what she did with her hand, and took her out of the row, and beat her up so that all her teeth fell out, the front teeth fell out. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">To tell you, when I married I am so, I am honest to tell you I have never even thought about this scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">When I first started to have sexual intercourse with a man, it never took me back there to that scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I wished my mother would have known it. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">This is probably my strong nature that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I know how to disconnect myself, and when I started to date my husband, he was my first date, and my husband, I felt loved and I loved, and I didn't feel like thinking about what happened so many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">As I say, I wish she should have known it, that I became a normal person. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">In any way normal, except in the many things that I enjoy life maybe more powerful than all of you and that kind of a feeling of "Where were you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I don't want to put any guilt on anyone, especially I talk to people who weren't even born when I talk to them, as probably you, yourself, but I do ask the question again and again and again, "Where were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Why did you let me rot there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And that is what is in my life, but I try to do the best I can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Are there any other particular incidences that are vivid memories for you that you would like to share.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Yah, we were once put in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going back and forth 3 days, 3 nights and, you know, they filled up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> to the maximum, closed the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and to go 3 days and 3 nights without having a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , you can imagine, without food, you can imagine what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I was very small and I was pushed out from my small <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> that they got and all of a sudden nobody wanted to give me back my little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And so I was thrown from one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I was all bruised up, and then all of a sudden after being so tired and crying, I sat on someone and this person did not say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So I was sitting and sitting and sitting and I was so grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I remember vividly that I did speak to that person all the time until I fell asleep and then I wanted, when they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , I wanted to say thank you for letting me rest finally, after being thrown from one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> to another, and that person was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">To see those eyes, you know, you turn around and you say, "Gencuie(ph), which means in Polish, "Thank You," and those two big eyes, that was a scene which is, I also don't forget so easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And there were many things that, many things in my life that I could talk about, but
QUESTION:  The more things that you can share, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Do I want to share everything? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">This is the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Do I want to share everything I know or everything? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Well, I don't think that I do want to say everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Not because I don't want others to know, but I want to be happy and yesterday, I cried and the day before, I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Today I cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Usually when I live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I don't talk Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">It is, I don't! </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I live a very normal life, but I understand you need to show the world that it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I am sure that there were people that will hear my voice will say, "Well, she has a vivid imagination." </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Some people will not believe it, as today some people don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I mean not everybody believes it. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But what could I tell you more? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I loved my sister very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">She was very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It's difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It's difficult to talk about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Really! </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It's a tough topic to talk, especially when I really am a very happy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I am extremely happy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Even as a widow, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I had wonderful 26 years, and I repeat it because it was given to be as a present. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Others didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Not my sister, not all my family, not my mother, not my father, and I have to be grateful that I was chosen by God, or I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It's a philosophical statement, by God or not by God, I was chosen to be alive and to enjoy life. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So I do want to enjoy life very much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Well, I was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I was 13 when I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">You see even the age when I tell you, it is an assumption that I was 12 or 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I, you know, because I really didn't know how old I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I remembered only that I was born in the 30s, on Ist of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">That I remember, because I remember the birthday parties that were given to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> after I got my bullets, they asked me, "How old are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And I said, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And why didn't I know? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Because when I had my mother still, when they were cleaning up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> from children, she would say to me, "If the Germans catch you, tell that you are 15, 15, 16." </span><span class="sentence" id="442">When we would go away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> she would say, "Go and ask this Germans for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Tell him that you are a little girl of 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Of 9. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Of 8." </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It went on and off. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Once I was older because she was afraid that I would die if I say that, if they find out that my real age, and when she wanted me to beg for a piece of bread, she understood that maybe they would have some pity on a smaller child. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So when I woke up after 3 days without conscious because I lost a lot of blood, being already on the verge of dying because I had typhoid and no food, no water, for the last time before the Russian entered. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I woke up in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in a wide <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with infusion here, infusion there, a cast, and they asked me how old I am and I said, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I really didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And piece by piece I have, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I found my brother and I found an Aunt that was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">She is 85 years old now, and she was telling me I was born 1n 32. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">She remembers it, but I said, I don't care if I was born in 31, 32, or 33. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It was in the 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So I was very small, and I was probably the only child already at the last year that was left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Or maybe there were, but its 100,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I knew only my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , or maybe the second <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Also, I didn't know people by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Nobody was interested in me, and I wasn't interested in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was a gray life of getting up at very early in the morning and then thy had appell(ph) which means you had, they had to count you. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We all, as you see, we don't have the number, but we had the number, Stutthof a number of, the iron number on a chain, which you wore all day long and all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And they never called you by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They called you by number. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">What should people, grownup people that were hungry and were afraid, talk to a child that was not their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Anyhow they knew that I am going to die because if the Germans will come and clean up from unwanted people, I will be the first one to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So to say like today when you see a child on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and this child has pain or something or a child lost his way, you ask, "Little girl or little boy, where do you want to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Many times when I see a child crossing the <span class="DLF">street</span> , "I say don't cross even when is green. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Keep my hand." </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I'll cross the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">That was not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It wasn't! </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Because everybody was afraid and frightened and hungry and thirsty and worked out and beaten up and so, the psychology was not the place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Psychology today, everybody today runs to the psychologist if he has the slightest problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We didn't have psychologists. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And people, even if they knew about psychology, which probably some knew, what, they were, we were not human beings.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  The last day? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Oh, we knew that the war is coming to end. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That even I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But we knew because they were saying that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , that they hear the roaring of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> of the battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And, uh, I was lying in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We didn't get water. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I was very sick, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">When they weighed me, I was 18 kilo. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I don't know how much it is in pounds, but 18 kilo is very little, 1s very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">No hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I had all stains on my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I still have a few left. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And the last day I did hear of lot of "Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu..." And I heard that people were praying because it was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And then, in the morning, people were hopeful. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">But in the morning, two Germans came with a machine gun and we heard that they were already in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , in the other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We heard the screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I was lying on my tummy, and I got the two bullets in my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I have quite a few holes on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I never did a plastic surgery on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Never disturbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But, uh, and then I fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The last thing which I knew 1s that, and I remember it because I wrote it also in the diary, that from here til here, it's over. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I don't have, I have only half a body because the fire of the bullets, you feel such a hot, such a heat, and you faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You don't, you lose your conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I lost a lot of blood, and they told me that I was lying there 2 hours or something like that and the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> came in and with every battalion comes a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> , and male nurses came and they found this little girl still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So they took me in, into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I was operated, the first bullet was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And they thought it is only one bullet and as it was broke and everything, they put me in a cast, but that was a terrible mistake, because I got an infection and they had to take out the cast and operate again to find, they knew already, that there must be a foreign body <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , with such a terrible infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But it was very painful to lie in a cast which was full with infection, terrible painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But here again, I wanted to live, and I survived that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">It wasn't very easy to live 3 years in a <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">First was the Nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I didn't speak Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Not a word Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And they knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Every night, I took a piece of bread and a potato, put it under the pillow. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Maybe tomorrow there won't be food. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Every night they took it away in the morning, and every night I put back from the dinner a piece of bread and a potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So to say that I was a total, normal person when the war was over, probably not if this was my daily routine of hiding a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But afterwards, I got used to, I started to speak Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I was the only child in the <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The only child! </span><span class="sentence" id="567">This, in my life, the problem is that I never had a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Wherever I was, I was the only child.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you once more if there are any particular incidences that stand out in your mind that you would like to have recorded on this tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  I would like to say to the women and mothers that will listen to me that the love of a Jewish mother or any other mother, I don't know, I am Jewish so I am speaking about the Jewish mother, was so strong that one day, you know, that tracks would always come to clean up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> from old, sick, invalids, and children, and my mother always managed to save me. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And one day, she didn't hear the whistle of the tracks and it was too late, and as you know we didn't have any <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , but we had <span class="DLF">pits</span> where we did what we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And in despair, she took the little girl and she threw me there <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , praying to God that it wasn't deeper than I, my height, and I was standing there til here til the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> went away, and she came out and took me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">There was no hot water, and she washed me with cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Didn't have any hair, so it wasn't so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">But the smell couldn't come out from me, and people didn't like to sit near me. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I remember ___, "Get away, take away, that smelly child." </span><span class="sentence" id="693">That I remember very vividly, and I am telling it to those people, to those women that have children and that will listen, that the love of a mother, and she did not really know if she could take out me alive, because if it would have been fuller, I would have been drown in that, but I did stand til here, could still breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Eh, I don't know if people, even that will listen to my story, if they comprehend what happened in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I don't know, because I, myself, when I am talking to you, I ask myself, "Do you really comprehend what went there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Because I think that the two people that are sitting here as gentlemen, and you don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You don't! </span><span class="sentence" id="698">You have never heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">You have never seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I hope that you will never, never feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">That to tell a story like that 45 years later, that a mother throws the child from desperation into a <span class="DLF">pit</span> and thinks, "Well, maybe she'll drown and maybe not." </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I don't think that you understand it, because I don't understand it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It's difficult to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I hope other people will learn a lesson from it, but it's unheard what, what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">It's unheard. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It was never in the history, and nobody can convince me there was anything like it in the history of humankind. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We had wars, we had pogroms, we had Armenian people, we had Biafra--you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But systematically kill people in the way like the Germans did, and the number and the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">When I think about it, that uh a earthquake takes 400 people and the whole world is shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We send everything possible to save the people, to help them; and 1,500,000 kids, like myself, and nobody send anything, and nobody did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I cannot, and will not ever, ‘til I live, understand what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">What happened with the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And I think it's important that people hear you. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I spoken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Northshore</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">Salem school</span> to 105 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Not even one Jewish child was there in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Was in the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">There were mostly blacks, Puerto Ricans--American children. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And I talked to them about the Holocaust, and told them about some of the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And the children just were quiet, and some had tears in their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And one child, black child, asked me--such a clever little boy--asked me, "Mrs. Roth, can I ask you a question?" </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And he says, "Are you angry?" </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I said, "How can I explain that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I said, "Yes, and No. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I am angry and not angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Angry that nobody did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Not angry because I do have that luck that I am telling you this story." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So I shouldn't be totally angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And it's so important, 1n my opinion, to really...to tell that story to the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Because uh they will learn from it, the lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">How much, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">The world is very, the world is very brutal, still, but maybe they'll learn it from that.</span></p>
