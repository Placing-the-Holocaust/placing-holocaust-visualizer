<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">My parents name is Noah Blass, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Then my mother was Bluma Blass. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Her maiden name was Goldvasser, and what -- what else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Your brother’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Oh, my brother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My brother’s name was Moshe Ben Blass. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It’s Hebrew names, and they were translated int-into Monyek Blass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  And was he younger or older than you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  He was a year and a half younger than I am, and he died unfortunately, in a camp near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , a camp for men, Brunow. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was there with my father, and after the war I found out that they both died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That’s about all I heard about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Were you a particularly religious family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Comparing to religious -- being religious here, and being religious in Europe was that the -- medium. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I mean, just observant Jew, when they came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , seemed to be as religious as the Orthodox ones, practically, because we took our religion very seriously, whether we observed to the point where it was fanatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So, of course, we observed it, but not to the point a Hassidim did. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So when we came here, I felt myself being quite religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And we belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> here, and -- I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , and -- by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I moved right after I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> , and we made our life over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And of course we -- the first thing where we did, we belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and it was the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span> of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  But back when you were a child, your family wasn’t particularly --
ANSWER:  Oh well, I -- we were observant, quite observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We did not do anything that wasn’t supposed to, but the -- the difference may be -- the visible difference was that my father wore just regular clothes that everybody is wearing, where the Hassidim, the Orthodox -- ultra Orthodox were wearing their, you know, religious habits, and wha -- whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So that was the only -- you -- you could distinguish a extremely religious Jew from just a religious Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And of course there were Jewish people who were not observant at all, but they -- everybody knew, and they consider themself being Jewish, but they were not observant as we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Can you talk about your relationship with your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Were you very close to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Well, like I said, my life was wonderful when I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had a very close relationship, very much so with my mother, and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I admired my father a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He -- he was el -- actually living, during World War Two in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He spoke -- spoke eng -- I mean, G-German very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I learned to speak German from him, and- and -- well, my brother was too small to -- to learn German, but -- and then when the war broke out, of course, I was frightened because I -- everything that was happening was so scary and unfamiliar to me that I -- I really didn’t know how to look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So I remem - remember my father always telling me, “Don’t worry, the German are -- are not going to hurt anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They are intelligent, educated people, and they will not harm anybod- body.” </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The intelligence and education might apply to them, but the fact of the way they behaved like animals, like you know, like -- like -- that remind me actually when -- when there was a hunt -- you know, rabbit hunt, or deer hunt, or whatever it is in the English way, where they let all the dogs run after them, that just remind me of the situation in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Can you talk about life in the -- and I might be pronouncing this wrong, the wear -- vearts --
ANSWER:  Yeah, it is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  How long were you there, and -- and what was it like there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Okay, I like to describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">This was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with quite a large Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">When the war broke out, they were supposed to -- or they were, actually, making a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And of course my -- my father, that was his decision, and we ga -- went along with it, decided that we would move to the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , maybe the Germans will not get there as fast as they get first to the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , which was really the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And also the reason we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> was because my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , and she still had rel-relatives over there, sisters and -- yeah, sisters mainly, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , and in the beginning it sim -- seemed to be okay, but the fact was that -- that our life changed because of not having proper living conditions and <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So it was difficult, and of course my father’s livelihood ceased to exist, because he couldn’t do what he did at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my father had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of military uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In other words, it was Boy Scouts, tha -- I mean that led to it, Boy Scout, prepartor -- preparatory military, and then he also branched out to have sports goods like skiing outfits, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So we were doing well, and I don’t think he had accumulated a fortune anywhere, or anything, unless I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But we had to leave everything, and just move there. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My father organized for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> drawn by two horses, and we took what we could, and the -- just went, and of course we were very lucky, because somehow we were not disturb along the -- the way to -- you know, cause it could have been easily that the Germans would stop us and -- and suspect us of doing something wrong and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So we were not stopped, and we went straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  What were the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> like there for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Well, we just occu -- well, first of all, the places in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> -- it’s a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> comparing to -- to the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , where you have -- we didn’t have skyscraper-scrapers, but we had <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> three, four, five story tall, and -- and in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , the majority of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were wooden <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , short, you know, one story, or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, no water in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , and so on, so of course, it was quite a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But it would have been all been good if 1 -- if 1t had not end the way it ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And also, it was difficult to make ends meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">When -- during that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , I was 14 years old or so, I -- with a friend of mine, we decided to make -- organize a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , which we did in -- in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> consisted of a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and a larger <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> were, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , whatever, just -- but we managed somewhat, and we had a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and people were very happy to -- to bring the children, because they were able to do other things, although their businesses and so on did not -- did not -- almost didn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But still, they were glad to have the children away, so I was earning some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was not a great deal, but 1t was enough to -- to buy food, which was the most important thing at that time. [</span><span class="sentence" id="63">indecipherable]
QUESTION:  An-And so you did have enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And what was sanitation like 1-in the --
ANSWER:  Sanitation, well, like I said, there were no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , there were no -- there’s no water, but with all this, you get used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">When the water was brought in, we used our s - the sanitation was basically almost like before, but the fact was that it was a little harder to obtain it, you know, to -- to work at 1t, cause water had to be brought in, and -- and they had outies on -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So that’s the way -- that’s the only way. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">If we were left alone in peace, we would have actually adapted to it, but every day they had different regulations, and finally they formed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , where at this -- to this point, there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and then they made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Luck -- lucky enough where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And this <span class="REGION">area</span> was going to be part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so we didn’t have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But many other people had to move, and what happened then, they made them move with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">In other words, we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and th -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , which was a little bit larger than -- than normally, so we had to share this with another family, 1t was a family of a mother and daughter, and a husband, and a grandmother, and they all were together with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And things begin to -- begin to be quite difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  You were doing some teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Beg your pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  You were doing some teaching w -- at the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  What about your own education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  I started a w -- [had half a year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I started -- I finished the -- you know, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and then I went to a pu -- to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And -- but I always wanted to learn, and I always -- and my parents especially, were very particular, as far as our education is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So I know -- I had a teacher, a -- a group, in group studies where I was taking French. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I tried to improve on German, I was taking Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I wa -- anything, anything just cause I was so hungry for knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we also, like I said, we took Hebrew, because my -- my father wanted my brother to -- to learn Hebrew, so we were -- a man was coming for a half an hour, whatever it 1s, and was teaching us Hebrew, and -- my -- my brother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So -- actually -- and then I was teaching myself a lot of things, cause I was always curious, and so -- so that -- that was my education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in -- in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we were until 19 -- ninet -- beginning of 19 four -- four -- well, maybe a little -- in 1942, beginning of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And at that time, they evidently wanted to -- to get everybody out, sent the majority of people to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and they had two <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> over there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">One was a <span class="BUILDING">woodwork factory</span> , which unbelievably belonged to my first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">A big <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> , you know, I don’t know how many acres of <span class="REGION">land</span> , with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> , and -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And they have a -- a tremendous <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where they had machinery to cut and polish, and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And that <span class="BUILDING">woodwork factory</span> was taken over by the Germans to -- and transferred to produce articles and you know, for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Like, for example, they manufactured <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ammunition boxes</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> , and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So they took it over completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Of course, my cousin and his family were shot during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And of course, I don’t know if they had any heirs to -- to claim it or whatever it is, but that was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And of course then, like at the end of -- I may wrong as far as timing 1s concerned, but 1t might have been the end of ’43, or maybe early beginning of ’44, where they dissolved the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We were working there, and I- living there, and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They arranged a <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were living, like for example men in one tremendous <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , and women in the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So it was like a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And -- and we also received one meal a day of cooked -- cooked food, and then the rest of it we had to organize ourselves, so some people who were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had brought in money, and they, since they knew the non- Jewish people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they were elbo -- able to communicate with them, and get -- get them to bring money for -- bring food for money, so for them it was easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">For myself and my family it was harder, but we survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> all totaled, before you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well, we -- we got there the very end of 1939, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That -- that would have been because they said they were going to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So we just took off before the closing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because we knew -- or we had an idea that once we are closed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we wouldn’t be able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So that’s what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  I want to go back and ask you --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  -- one other question about your --

<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  It was -- 1-in those days, it was not -- there was no possibility from my point of view, and for what I remember, for any Jewish person to be political We just did what we supposed to do, what we were oud -- allowed to do, and th-there was -- and if there -- we were political, it would have been in the area of -- of Judaism, and speaking of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But other than that, we had no -- not much to say as far as the politics of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were concerned.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yeah, how do you say they -- evacuation, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now, before the ev-evacuation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , we had -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> was a -- it was like a twin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It -- one <span class="NPIP">part</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , and the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> were -- was when- where they had a sealed <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I don’t know what they did before the war in it, but evidently things for economy, for a -- you know, whatever it is, from -- for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But when the Germans came in, they transferred that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> it -- into doing I don’t know, maybe bullets, maybe this, maybe that, I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So this is one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">You speaking of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Myoufka</span> , it was just a place high up on a -- on a big <span class="DLF">hill</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , where they arrange for some reason, which is amazing because I -- I really don’t know how they could have done it so fast, unless this <span class="REGION">area</span> was used for something else -- they had little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> there and la -- in <span class="REGION">areas</span> , and they put all of us, during the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , they put part of us there, and then a part of us in another, similar <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> built. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They evidently had an idea that this is what they were going to do, because they had to work from the beginning to be able to- to have all this done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  One of the things that we wanted to have you go over was the attack of the guard, a fellow named Shrot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Oh, well that was about the same time when they evacuated us -- us from our -- the place in Polish was named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tartuck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">In German, it was called Zagaverker. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It all means a f- a wood -- <span class="BUILDING">wood factory</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">When they expelled us from over there, they put us all - there was a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , like every small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in Europe, and even the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> had <span class="BUILDING">marketplaces</span> , and they -- you know, chased us all through the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , put us in rows and so on, and a -- did something the same what they did later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , like making a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">This one here, this one there, wi -- which meant -- later on we found out, the younger people were left to work in the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that were still available, and they were producing goods for the German -- for the Germans, and the older ones were moved straight on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and they moved them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Okay, well I was among them, and of course, we were lucky somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">When they took me and my brother, and -- on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , they put my parents on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , I knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I mean, you just -- 1t was a instinct that told me what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So, when they were running among -- there were hundreds and thousands of people, actually, because there was a great number of people that they send from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> to our -- to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , because they did it very systematically. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Not just come to every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and try to dig out to -- whatever number of Jews was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But they concentrated all the Jews from surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , into one which was little largest -- larger. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And then from over there they made the selection and shipped the number of people to -- to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , the remaining number they situated in different <span class="REGION">areas</span> for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And prior to it, you know, during that selection, I was lucky because somehow -- I-I was very brave when I -- when I was young, I didn’t feel like anybody could destroy me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You know, when you -- you are young, you just -- so I grabbed my parents from the <span class="DLF">lo -- line</span> nearby, and pulled them in front of me, and lucky enough nobody repla -- placed them back in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we survived for awhile in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for -- I think we were there for almost two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Can you tell about that attack on the guard? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">A guard named -- 1s it Shrot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Shrot, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Can you tell me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Yes, well you see, when we -- when they -- that was after the -- after they evacuated us, after the time we lived already on -- on a ta -- on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tartuck</span> , where the -- you know, where we work, after that they decided to evacuate us, and put us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So they one day, without any warning, without anything, they -- they arrived wi -- with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were covered with -- with canopy or whatever it is, and they just took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They didn’t even allow us to take anything that we wanted, which is a normal reaction of anyone that wants to take their things with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">W -- and packed us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , and we had no idea where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So -- back -- what they did, they could not take us right away to the -- to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> -- to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to be send away, so they temporarily, for two, three days, put -- put us in this little <span class="REGION">area</span> where they had the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> built, and left us over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And wh -- we waited for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">When we got there, they had a big <span class="REGION">area</span> which was like a <span class="DLF">yard</span> , you know, and then the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And when we got there, the <span class="REGION">area</span> that was supposed to be the <span class="DLF">yard</span> had two great, long <span class="DLF">ditches</span> dug on- like between, you know, six or so <span class="DLF">yards</span> between each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we couldn’t understand what it was, but quickly we -- we find out -- found out what it was, cause they told us right away the man should stand on one side of one <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , the women on the other side of that <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then this man that I was speaking about shouted who was -- he was actually a -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , and -- and they -- in the beginning of the war the Germans solicited the -- the Ukraines and give them -- you know, to -- to belong -- to do the dirty work, you know, and have sort of identifying clothes like a -- to make -- make us understand that they belong to the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Well these people did all the dirty work, so they were, at that time, going to be the ones that were going to execute what the Germans told them to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So, when we were standing on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , the German here, this Shrot, started speaking in German, and said, “You have one minute to -- to be -- to say your prayers, and you going to be shot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Just plainly, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Naturally, you can just imagine what happens to -- to a person when you hear something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We were all like paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I mean, I -- I couldn’t even move. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The only thing was that my brain was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And when I looked at my mother, I -- and I saw her -- her -- her face was white like a sheet of paper, and her heart was -- you c -- you could see it was, you know, beating so hard I could almost hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And I guess prompted me to do something that maybe normally I wouldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I was so frightened for her and -- and they were the only ones that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So I -- when he finished talking, I simply, without even thinking any more, I jumped out, and he was standing us -- oh, in front of me, in front of the -- between the two <span class="DLF">graves</span> , and I jumped, and I jumped on his back, and grabbed him by his neck, and I-I always had long fingernails, and I -- you know, pressed as hard as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I’m sure that I have wounded him in some <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I realized that if I -- I -- I didn’t know what else to do, I had no gun or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And the only thing I -- I -- at that moment, my instinct told me just to cling on his back li -- on his back like that, that at -- at a point like this, he will not be able to do anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Which proved to be actually correct, because the Germans sta -- or the Ukraines started screaming, “Shoot her, shoot her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But of course, if they shot me, they would have sh-shot him, too, so tho -- they didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">In the meantime, as I was lying there -- as I was al -- still clinging to him, finally we both fell down, and they -- they came and they pulled him away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">As they pulled him away, I realized that, as far as my life was concerned is -- it was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But it took all the situation, and all the development, took so much time, that it was getting dark outsir -- <span class="NPIP">outside</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And then, when they pulled him away, they decided to shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So they came to him, they told him shoot the beast, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">In German is, sheeza de bestia, means shoot the be -- beast. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And he said I -- and I heard it, m-my English was good, and I could understand every word he was saying, and he said, “No, I will not shoot her yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">She must,” -- the word was edwastonsin, must perform, or dance, or -- what he meant by it is I -- he wanted me to -- to beg for our life and you know, go crazy and kiss his feet, or whatever he planned. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So he said, “She must dance a little before I shoot her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Finally -- and as I fell, I -- I decided I was not going to move no matter what happens, that I’m not going to budge. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So they checked me, checked my pulse, checked this, and it was -- stupid idiot couldn’t even find a pulse, so they decided that I was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And what happened --
QUESTION:  Well, had they shot you at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Not yet, not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But then, one person, who became my sister-in-law later -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
ANSWER:  But then one person, who became my sister-in-law later, a lady, she started crying, you know, because people didn’t know how to react. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They didn’t know what was good to say, and what was bad to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So she started crying, “Please help her, she must have just fainted.” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And you know, when I heard her say that -- I still remember it to this -- you know, you remember every reaction, every -- what-whatever I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And she -- and I said to m-m -- was thinking to myself, “My God, please don’t say anything, I don’t want them to know that I am alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And then when they finally pulled me away, they marched all the people into the empty <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that they had, you know, left, you know, unoccupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And -- and there were two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and they filled the two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbeds</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">The amount of people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was about 300, so it wasn’t such a great number. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And they put us in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I was still lying down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and suddenly the -- 1t was dark already, and we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> -- or were- they were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They were cruising around and -- and dropping bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So we -- we knew about it, and we were quite aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So they didn’t do anything, and they had searchlights that they stopped using, because they were afraid that they were going to bomb -- bomb us. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And later, when the bombing stopped, they turned on the searchlight, and they were going round and round, which would put lights on me, too, on the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was lying down. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Anyhow, at that time, I realized, and I got used to the dark, and I saw the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I had no idea that the people were marched into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But I was thinking, and I se -- and they were on stilts. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So I had no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could crawl to hide, and I just thought that if I do that, maybe that will help, and I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And as I crawled under the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , I heard people walk, and I heard voices, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I recognized Polish, and Jewish, and I -- I -- I realized that these were the people that I came with. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Because at first I thought maybe they were other Jews from some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And so anyhow, I still was sitting under the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and -- and I felt every time I was breathing, I felt I -- I was picking the whole <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on my back, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And nothing was happening after, you know, until morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">At dusk in -- I realized -- and I was evidently not far from the little <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , from the you know, <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I saw people walking down, and I saw they were having, you know, all shoes, and you know, clogs, and this and that, which did not indicate that they were Ss -- people that came from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , that they were inmates from the -- from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And as I saw this, I decided I will step out, and -- I couldn’t sit there underneath the ba -- the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So I stepped out, and as I came out from underneath the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , here were <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , and where I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , there was my father, my mother, my brother, all in tears, and terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Because, what happened -- evidently they were communicating at night, and realizing that I -- my body was not in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Did I mention about the shooting before? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">No, I did not, you see, that’s what happens when you don’t -- don’t have a -- a schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Anyhow, after they put the people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, after they marched them there, the guy came over and shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And my head was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Now you most probably can still see a scar. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I can see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  I can see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But you know, so many years, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So when -- he shot me, and since my face was only halfway exposed, and the other half was -- was, you know, flush to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , he -- when he shot me, the bullet grazed my forehead, and I came from one <span class="NPIP">point</span> , out through the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So I wasn’t hurt greatly, or anything and -- and it didn’t even hurt for some reason, I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Maybe I was too excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And
QUESTION:  Was this the f -- who was the person who shot you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Shrot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Shrot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  And how close a <span class="DLF">range</span> was he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Well, he was standing over me, that’s how close, and -- and he missed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Because it could have been obvious that when he’s going to shoot me, he will shoot me right -- you know, I -- right in my head all -- my temple, and be finished with it, but he did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Maybe he was scared for his own life because they we -- started bombing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  And was he the only one around at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Wh-Who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Just he and you, you were lying there, and --
ANSWER:  Y -- no, they -- there were the other -- no, the other ones, the other Ukrainians, that they were packing everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Now, there might have been a couple other ones with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I don’t know, I’m sure there were, because since I wasn’t killed yet, you know, they thought maybe I’Il jump up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So -- and then they all left. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But when the bombings stopped, they evidently, like I said, communicated among them, and they realized that my body was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, what they assumed that the Jewish people took me, and hid me. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And the Jewish people when they found out -- they also found out that I wasn’t there, because they came and asked them where I am, and I was still under the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So they said they didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So they didn’t -- so the Jews thought that the Germans took me, that, you know, I was dead and the Germans took me, and wanted to cover up -- because basically what we later found out, that they did not have a order to shoot all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And this is what they wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Without the order they would have shot all of us, have -- has -- ha -- it wasn’t for the incident and the situation that I somewhat created not -- not knowing they would have shot all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But since the time lapsed, and it got dark, and the bombing started, they were worrying about their own lives, and therefore, all this stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And they didn’t want to leave us on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , because with a mass of people like that, you never know what they may do. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So they were afraid of a riot, that they wouldn’t be able to control us. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So they put the people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And then -- of course, in the morning when I got out from the -- under the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , I was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">My face -- my face was somewhat bloody, but I scraped off the mo -- most of it, because I was curious what it was, and since I had one free hand to be able to move, so I -- I touched it, and I realized that I wasn’t hurt badly, and I -- and I am still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So when I c-came out, my parents were all in tears, and shock, and then when they realize -- they all realize that I am alive, their first instinct was to -- to get rid of me somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I mean, not that they wanted to kill me or anything like that, but to hide me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And they decided to hide me under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> , but it was straw -- to hide me under the straw that -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was a long <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , on both side were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbeds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And here in the middle was like an <span class="DLF">alley</span> , you know, all the way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So they marched me, and they -- they put me under the straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And -- all it was a few minutes later, or it seemed like a few minutes later, this Shrot came, and he was entering the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> from wa -- from one <span class="NPIP">end</span> , and walking with a gun in his hand, and screaming, “Wo ist da bestia?” </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Where 1s the beast. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">If you don’t produce her right -- immediately, I’m going to shoot everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So I heard it, and I just knew it was bad, and I didn’t want anything to happen to anybody else, and my parents and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So I stepped out from it, and I knew that was the end of it, and I just simply decided that I am not going to be scared, that I am going to be proud, and I stepped out, and I said in German, “Here I am.” </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And then he grabbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Didn’t shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Evidently he had -- he had orders from the German that was in charge of all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , of all the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So he definitely had the orders not to shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And so he grabbed me by my hand, pulled me out and the -- the <span class="REGION">area</span> -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was wired all around with, I think, electric wires, if I’m not mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And they -- he pulled me out and took me beyond the wires, you know, and pushed me in -- into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> -- small <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> where they ke -- had wood for fire and coal and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Was just a barely -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I barely could -- could fit, because it was loaded with wood and lumber. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And here I was, and then when he closed the -- the -- locked the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> , he started shooting in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , bang, bang, bang, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And the people 1n con -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had said okay, this is the end of me because he shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Well, that did not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">A few minutes later, they send over the -- the commander of the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , and he came in in his big, shiny boots, and guns, and everything, and

</span><span class="sentence" id="283">So I says I -- and I tried to kind of minimize the whole thing and make it into something else, that -- not that I jumped him, that I wanted to play -- pray for my safety, and -- and he should leave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">As -- so I kind of did not say anything, I said I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Then he went to the back of my head, because he wanted to see if the bullet came out through there. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I had a wound over there, but the -- the wound was from the butt of the rifle, you know, where they hit me before he shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So he couldn’t understand, and he says, “Well, how did the bullet come?” </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And he spoke to me German. “</span><span class="sentence" id="289">How did the bullet come here, and then -- and -- and you are still here?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I -- I

took me over there and had the people clean out -- clean up the wound, and put iodine, whatever they did, and -- and bandage, and that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And then they put me in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That was one phase. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then while I wa -- I was in the <span

they could not come, so they had to do it the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So they came, everybody was gathering around, we ha -- and they thought it was a miracle, you know, how Jewish people always think of a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I mean, most probably other people, of other religion and so on will -- will kind of associate something like that with a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So he -- everybody was coming to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I remember distinctly, now that -- a -- a man -- I mean, to me, he looked

</span><span class="sentence" id="303">I found a book -- no- not I, but my brother-in-law found it, cause he was working in a -- in -- in a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He found a book written by a guy named Moshe Porrot. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And he was the one that wrote about this incident and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Of course, he elaborated on it, and -- and stretched it, and wrote every detail of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And after the war, when -- when I already had

so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And we looked for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We found the names, we found all kind of things, but we did not find the book. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, we were transported by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , and a very young Swedish man, as a matter of fact, my age at that time, although some were Jewish that volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">You know how it is, you know, just like the people that volunteer now to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and so on, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So they volunteered, and they were driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">There was one attendant, and one driver, or maybe both of them and they were changing, you know, <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="570">From over there, we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- no, by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- no, we -- I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> for about eight, nine months, and then when all this has developed that you could hear from different people, and about different people, it can correspond and so on, and that was the time when my husband wrote a letter to the es -- ac-actually, 1t wasn’t my husband that wrote the letter, it was my brother-in-law that wrote a letter looking for his sister-in-law, and I was n-not even close to being a sister-in-law or anything, but they evidently give priority to people that were related, you know, and looking for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So the letter came to me from him, and once we established our <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and were able to correspond, then we -- my husband arranged what I told you before, that I had to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because that’s where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">He had to wait because he found his father somewhere, and he had to wait for his father to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So, we all came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a -- oh my God, what was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Buch -- no, I forgot already the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Anyhow -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , okay, 1t was camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And of course, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was completely flattened, burned and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">There was no sign of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">After the war, you know, and th-there was so much typhus and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So it was burned down, and I am not sure if that was the only reason that they burned it down, they just wanted to burn the evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And -- but nearby, like a couple miles away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , was a camp where the Germans were -- I don’t know exactly what it was there bef-before the war, but it did not look like it was especially built for them or anything, there were brick <span class="BUILDING">duplexes</span> built, and th-the Germans occupied it, the ones that overseed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well, after the war, they put -- the Germans left, naturally, and they put all the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , most of them were sick and so on, and he -- they put them into all their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And they immediately established -- they were doctors that came there from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and -- and from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and they establish, you know, just like a little -- tiny, little complex -- living complex like- it wasn’t big enough to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but it was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they assisted the Jews, and there were all kind of newcomers that would come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and they found out that this was the point of gathering on this -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So they would come over there, and that’s where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">We lived there for several months, and -- and that’s where we got married, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And when -- after that, we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , evidently, we were able to organize transport to [indecipherable] the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">By then we already -- my husband established where his brother was living, and he was living in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I discovered purely by accident, through a man that was in the army from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> -- he lived -- cause when he was telling me that his family was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So I got all excited, and I told him -- and I told him about my family, that my -- my grandmother lived in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So, through him I found out my relatives, and then I found the aunt, and -- and - and -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And -- and that’s how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You know, it’s so confusing to remember about all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , when you went, and when you came. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Anyhow, this is -- through him, purely by accident, I found out -- I had no information, but I found all this from him, and I was able to get in touch with my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I visited them later, and then whatever.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="623">So we were nearby, and then I was able to see him, and not once, twice, or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Then they combined all -- the both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> into one, cause they needed people where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So my husband came, and the doctor, and he had a -- a -- he was working, they -- a -- occupied him to be the main person to see to people that got wounded during the work, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So that’s how I met my husband, and very casual and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But somehow, we knew each other, evidently he thought more of it than I did, because he took, you know, all the pain to find me after the war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And when he found me, and when I -- and when they wrote, I was glad in a way, cause it was the only person that was looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So I -- I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and we lived there until we were able to go to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and wait for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to come to the -- to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  And what year were you married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  We got married in s -- 50 -- May ’55. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">No, wait a sec, six -- 56. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">No, w-was it -- was it- no, sic -- 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">My God, yes, ’46, May °46. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The war ended in ’45, in -- in May, and -- and I meanwhile was in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and came back, and whatever it -- yeah, that’s when it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  When and where -- what year did you find out, or what -- when did you find out and how, about the fate of your father and brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Well, I found out -- first of all, I was looking, and I couldn’t find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And they were very efficient because we were writing to different Jewish organizations who were occupying themself, and making a point of finding people, and they did not find. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But then, later on, I found from the people who were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> whatever it is, or whatever, bits and pieces of information that he was sick, and that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunow</span> , a camp near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">It was a camp for -- for men, and that one person was sure that my brother died, because he saw him in a very bad state, and then my father most probably ti- dead, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And if he did not, then the -- the -- at time when they went on this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">march camp</span> , which was the same time that we went, he might have not survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> either, because I was never able to find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">That was all evidence and information I got.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  And you found that out pretty soon after the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  More about after they ended, because I got pictures, and -- from people that -- that had bits of pieces of -- from either -- I don’t know how they had it, don’t ask me how, but they -- they somehow obtained some little pictures here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Because we -- we were not able to bring pictures or anything, cause you know, when -- when IJ arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and they were taking us to -- they said to <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and this and that, when they stripped our clothes, we -- we thought that they were taking us to <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But of course, it did not happen, it happened different. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So when they took us there, I had with me some pictures, and money -- little money, which mean -- meant nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And they -- that was the only pictures I had, and the Germans would not let us take anything when they -- when we went 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and we -- we thought we were going to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And so they told us only to take the soap, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
ANSWER:  -- meant nothing, and they -- that was the only pictures I had, and the Germans would not let us take anything when they -- when we went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , and we -- we thought we were going to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And so they told us only to take the soap, and whatever it 1s in. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But we came out the other way of the -- of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we didn’t have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So they -- we were given some clothes, and some didn’t fit, and of course in -- in a way we were able to trade it with the people that got too large clothes, to get it smaller, and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And the clothes consisted only of -- of overdress, and clogs, and that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We didn’t have any undergarments or any, and that’s -- that’s all we were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So we just really didn’t have anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Tell me about coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , what that was like, and what your impressions were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Yes, I would like to speak about that, because it made -- first of all, a -- I was looking every -- everywhere if I was not going to be oppressed, and -- and brutalized, and -- and hurt, and whatever, just -- I didn’t know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I was amazed, I was amazed that actually there was kindness that I could notice in people’s eyes, and behavior, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Of course, I did not need anything, because I was already going to be taken care, and helped by my relatives that waited for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="661"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> -- I think at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> was still in operation, 50 - 55 years ago, don’t you think so? </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So -- so I didn’t need any specific help or anything, but -- and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , I didn’t need that either, because my aunt helped us find a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we lived very, very limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I mean, basically poorly on -- comparing to how I lived in Europe before the war, but everything was good because of the fact that we were no oppressed, and -- and discriminated against, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I was amazed, I couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Then, I mean, I- f-for example, I went to a doctor, you know, like in the process of -- of living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , I -- I had to find a doctor for different -- you know, you get -- all of a sudden you get illnesses when you didn’t even feel anything before. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And I found a doctor who was not Jewish, and I didn’t even think anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And he was so kind that -- that when I -- when I think about him to this day, I -- I have to cry, because that’s how kind he was to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So, really, all these things like that, putting together, contributed to -- to -- in a way to my recovery, and believing in human goodness, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So I was very, very happy to see that, and very amazed. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I mean, I -- I -- things did not cease to amaze me, as it -- as it came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Like, for example, why -- I don’t know whether I should mention that, but I was not aware in those days of the situation between blacks and whites. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Because all I knew is from movies, and I -- I could not find anything basically bad and discriminating, you know, that whites did to blacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But then, for example, on -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> you -- it was obvious that blacks were supposed to sit to the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and they were announcing, actually, for -- you know, people to vacate to the -- the <span class="REGION">front area</span> , and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So, it -- it upsets me -- it upset me a lot, but there was nothing I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Then another thing that I noticed, for example, black people in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> were very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I -- I’m not talking about young people -- very young people, because they were either very young people, or kids, so you don’t expect of them to behave differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But people sort of a little bit older, you know, where I walked -- when I walked the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , or something, I noticed that they were taking off their hat, and they were greeting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And I couldn’t understand why -- why -- why. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I came to my aunt once, and I asked her, “Why do people greet me here all the time?” </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I says, “I don’t know them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So she said it was a -- a custom for them to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So, I -- I thought it was remarkable, and felt very sorry about it when I, later on, understood what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">That’s all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Did you speak English when you first came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  [have a very good background of Latin, and in German also. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And I was able to translate things, but only the reading -- when I was reading it. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">When people were speaking to me, it all sounded like, you know, jumble bumble, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And I had difficulties, but I made my point to learn how to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I -- my first book was, “The Good Earth.” </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Can you imagine to try to un -- the reason I picked, “The Good Earth,” because I read it in Polish, and therefore I -- if I didn’t understand it all, I would j -- kind of make believe that I do, and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And that was the first book I read.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  What did your husband do for work to support yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Yes, well my husband, when we came -- and I told you that my aunt and my uncle were the ones that sponsored us, and they helped us a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And my -- my uncle had a- a <span class="BUILDING">Supermarket</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> was not what -- what you call a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> now, it was a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , a large <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , and people were picking their own stuff, and then coming to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">register</span> , so it was like a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So, since my husband learned -- my husband was actually a businessman before the war, and he was like about nine years older than I am, so he was already a young man, able to work and -- and sustain himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And -- and in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , he evidently, since he did not have anything else that he could understand well, he w-was working in the business of grocery. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And a year and a half later, he was able to buy a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> from a person -- of course, we didn’t have any money to buy it, but he was paying for 1t monthly as -- as 1t went, and then we had a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> that we -- we moved to another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and -- so he was doing this, and then I was helping him. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And then later on, he went in the business of wrecking. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Wrecking was very prominent in a way that everybody was -- was wrecking. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> from before the Civil War, and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And they had, in -- in those days they were building <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with old English brick, and those are the original bricks that were sent by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they were larger. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And -- and the wrecking was -- was very lucrative, because they were saving -- after wrecking it, they were cleaning the bricks, and they were reselling them, and they were a big -- it was important, it was a novelty, it was -- it was history. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So they saved the brick, and people were able to make lots of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So then he was working -- of course, he was only supervising them, and how he knew about it, ’ll never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">He was supervising, and e-employing people, and paying them. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">He wasn’t doing the original wrecking by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And this is how -- and he did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We did well, and we were thrifty. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Oh yes, there’s something else I would like to speak about. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">When my children were born and of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> age, I -- what’s that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  A siren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  Yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">It sounded like voices, scared me. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Anyhow, when the children beco -- became of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> age, since I was very well taken care of as a child and schooled properly -- i-in other words I went to a <span class="BUILDING">kin-kindergarten</span> , a private, Jewish owned kindergarten, it’s not that a -- a Jewish was -- they did not have any other <span class="BUILDING">kin-kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So I had to go to a - a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It’s not -- I would -- the reason I’m trying to mention it to you, it was not because it was Jewish or not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">But then I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then -- and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were divided, Jewish people, and non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Sunday, and the non-Jewish children went to their <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday, so that was the different. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And also, when I finished sixth grade, and of course I could have gone to the seventh grade, but since fortunately I was a good student, and I -- I also studied with -- with help, so I was advanced, and I was able to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> used to call in -- in European, we used to call you <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Which translates evidently <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> here, but -- but that’s not what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="722"><span class="BUILDING">Gimnasium</span> was the higher education, like <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And so I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> , and of course I wasn’t there long enough, cause the war started, and the Germans occupied our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and we were not able to be there any more, because my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was only girls school. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So we were not able to be there, because young soldiers and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And there were horrible things that were going on, they were raping, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So we were -- we -- they closed the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So that was it, but s-schooling for my parents meant awful lot, education and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And yeah, e -- speaking of education, my z -- my brother went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was basically Hebrew, but of course, Polish was learned, and just like if he went to a <span class="BUILDING">day school</span> where, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And so we were really very carefully taken care of, as far as education is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So naturally, when I became a mother, and my children started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I felt like I -- I -- I was thinking the same way, and -- although <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were different, and better, and -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were segregated, you know, so you -- it’s not that 1t was better or worse, but -- but they had good <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , so -- but I didn’t care about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">My sons went to a <span class="BUILDING">military school</span> , like children’s military, the -- you know, the <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And they were wearing uniforms, and everything, just like -- like regular military, but children. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And my daughter went to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">s-school</span> , and it was famous, it still is famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">It’s called <span class="BUILDING">Ashleigh Hall</span> , where it -- it was just for girls, and there were a -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> too, if somebody needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So my -- my children were very good ta-taking care of, and all of them, I’m very proud of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  And their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Norman Joseph was my oldest son. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Maurice Howard is my second son, he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Then I have Richard Ivan, and Stanley Paul, and well, my oldest daughter is Blanche Dorothy, and my youngest daughter is Sherry Lisa Weintraub. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">They all -- actually, most of them lived here, except for my son now that 1s practicing dentistry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  How did they get to know about your story as a Holocaust survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  Well, it actually took a long time, because people did not talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I had a -- actually, no intention to tell them, because it was too sad, and young children, I didn’t want to occupy their minds with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And -- and -- on the other hand yet too, I thought that it was bad that I was a priva -- prisoner, and that maybe I did something bad, and I did not want to -- to tell the children, cause they wouldn’t understand, so I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And therefore, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But then, later on, I remember on a couple occasions, when I used to come to pick up my daughter from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , her -- the principal came to me and -- and asked me if I could teach the children French. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And I told her, I -- I don’t speak French, I speak just a little bit, I have learned a little bit, but that is not enough to teach anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I told her I could maybe as -- instruct them in German, but they did not have German. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But anyhow, the point is that they -- that they couldn’t make me out what I am, and who I am, and they did not -- could not make a connection at that time, what was the Holocaust, and what the Holocaust did to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">You see, people were completely ig-ignorant. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">They knew the -- the war was bad, but they -- I -- they did not know how -- how it reduced us to become prisoners, and not -- nobodies, comparing to what we were before, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So that’s the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  So how was it that you -- how did you tell your -- your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Later on, when people started reading about it, and talking about it, and -- and writing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">They -- people would come to me, they ask me to -- to do a interview on television, and I did several of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Then they ask me to write some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They didn’t- they ask me to do different things, and speak to -- to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and -- and educate young schoolchildren, and tell them ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And -- and I was able to do that, and I wanted to do it, not only that I was able. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I did my best, and I was pretty busy all the time, and I worked, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I had my own business that I -- I was a clothes designer, and I opened up my own <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> , and I had to support my children later on, when my husband died, and he died in -- in ’73, which 1s a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So I still was busy, I had articles in the newspaper, and they would interview me, and have me tell them stories, and this is how everything came to light. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And later on -- in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , actually people were talking freely about it, better. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Where in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , pe -- people did not crawl out from the woodwork until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Maybe because there were more people in the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , where in our -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , we had maybe five or six family of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So that’s the way it 1s, and now my grandchildren know a lot about it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">One of my granddaughters wrote a story about me, and they had a little combination of stories in a -- in a book, where in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , they had to each come out with a story, and -- and it was published in a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And it was published only if it was good, and they were giving -- given a grade for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So my daughter -- my granddaughter did that, and I was very proud of it, proud of the fact that she was interested to know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And they still do, nowadays too, I have very young grandchildren still, that are interested in, and they make me come to their <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and -- and s -- talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Of course, you have to have a very special approach for children once you are a mother yourself, then you are able to apply it in a way where they will understand it, and it will not be so -- so drastic, and shocking to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So that’s the way I did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Why did you decided to send you sons to <span class="BUILDING">military school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  Well, it was not because of military in a way, but -- but because it was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">That was the only <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And of the fact that -- that 1- it was a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the only -- they were disciplined in a way, but not that they needed discipline, cause my children were -- were very well behave -- behaved, but they did have some military little things that they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Like, for example, they had a roll call in the morning before they entered classes, they stayed on attention when things were happening, and they were dressed military. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So it was -- it was like a boost to their personality, cause they felt like they were somebodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And -- and this is what I felt that should be instilled upon them, because I, during the war, lost all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">You know, the importance, and the -- the assurance, and -- and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So -- and then it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> that -- that I was in favor of, and therefore I did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  Did you feel patriotic, and did you feel like you were an American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  Oh, I am still patriotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I still feel that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I -- I felt to -- I’m still getting choked up -- I felt that way, and I feel that way all the time when it comes to -- to different things, like, for example, if you see on television different things that we are doing, or this, like for example, they send people now to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> to a -- assist them in saving the people from the ra -- from the earthquake. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I feel choked up, and I feel like crying, and I am very proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And then, one day I was, for example, in a <span class="BUILDING">s-store</span> , where the clerk was a young Jewish boy, a Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Well, I didn’t know if he was Jewish, or not Jewish, or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And I said something, not connecting, or referring to -- to his English, and- because it was obviously with a Russian accent, and I can detect it immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">So it was not the reason for that, but I said something, and he said to me, “This is <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="795">You know, like proudly, see, because they just escaped from the -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">There is lots of people here from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And when I found out, I says, “Why do you say that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He says, “Well, I’m happy to be here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And he told me he’s going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> already, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And then, in the process of -- of t-talking, he told me he was Jewish, because we were talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I says, “Well, how -- how are you able to be -- go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> already? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Your English is,” -- and I didn’t want to insult him, “is good, but is it good enough for <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="803">He says, “Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Besides,” he says, “I am Jewish, and Jewish people are smart.” </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Because -- you know, because whatever, I don’t know, I was proud of what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">It’s not that I necessarily feel that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I’m proud of myself, and I’m proud of being Jewish, and proud of whatever it is you have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So -- but this is the -- and it struck me. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I says, “My God, isn’t that wonderful?” </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And -- and -- and I always feel that way about the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , feel about it to the point where I -- where I can sit and cry because of the way I’m being treated here, and because of wh -- of the way I was able to grow up he -- here, and -- and establish my life, and -- and feel good about it, it’s very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  Pll just change th -- [break] Well let me ask you this; have you, and do you recall experiencing much anti-Semitism in -- in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  I am very upset with it, I’m very upset with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I -- as -- personally did not feel it, and if it was some -- somebody anti-Semitic that was in contact with me, or a -- they did not show any evidence tha -- how he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But of cou -- of course I am very upset when they still do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But to be honest, unfortunately, not that it makes me feel better, we are not the only group that -- that they are anti -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">There are a -- I see the same thing they feel about Chinese people, about, still, African people, or still Indian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Whatever it is, they -- they feel that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">So not that it -- I feel better being in a crowd, but I realize that I’m not the only one that is that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And then I have great belief, and strong appreciation for -- for the Jewish people that establish their life here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and what they contributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Makes me proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So --

<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  °69. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I -- I -- evidently some people that knew me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , because incredibly enough, most of the people, all the 300 of -- other people that -- that were saved by me -- I mean, I -- that was not my idea that -- that I developed, and realized that, but the people were telling me that I saved them, because most of them live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and -- and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> once for a visit, there was a gr-group of people that was present when all this happened, and they invited me with a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I didn’t know that, I just thought I was going to visit them, that -- you know, just to -- to remember them, because I was not a -- born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , I was just a newcomer, but they knew me enough from hearing about me, or little, you know, in touch with -- with me here, and there for a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So when I came to visit them, they surprised me to a point where I really was sitting and crying for half an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Because they had the little get together, invited everybody who knew me, and when I came in, they s-screamed, “Our hero 1s here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And then they made me believe that I was the one that was instrumental in saving them. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And then, when I started thinking about it, it really was so, because -- not that I planned it that way, because I didn’t plan it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But it happened though, because I -- I kind of messed up their timing, and it was dark, and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were flying, and they couldn’t finish what they wanted to do, and the next day it was already known to the -- to the commander, and he didn’t want that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He says, “Why should I kill them here, let them go to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , let them do whatever they want to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So, therefore, they -- they did not kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So he didn’t want anybody, and besides it, the Germans themself were angry when the people f -- the Ukraine people did things without their specific instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">They felt like they are the masters, and they are -- they are the ones to tell them what to do, and whatever it 1s, so -- what -- what was the --

<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So anyhow -- I got sidetracked, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I always do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Anyhow, where -- when people found out, they started being interested in the Jewish -- people started interest -- be-become interested about the crimes, and -- and you know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And when they found somebody that was guilty of crimes against the Jewish people, they -- they made a trial, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="845">The Germans thems -- themselves wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So, when they found out that I was a very strong witness against this guy, because I had something to show myself for, and I was a witness when they -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where I was, I told you, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , and where my husband was already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And the doctor -- there was outbreak of typhus, and there were seven people who were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And the seven people, they just didn’t want to cure them and do anything, although they would have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They made us put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> -- you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> that we produced, and take them to the <span class="DLF">cemeter -- cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And on this <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , they had a big <span class="DLF">grave</span> dug, and they made those people kneel down -- there were seven only, seven or eight -- and shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So I was a witness of that, which was absolutely -- I mean he killed s-single- handedly, seven people. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And that’s enough to be con-convicted if you kill one, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="853">S -- and then he wanted to kill me, and didn’t su-succeed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Didn’t you go to your <span class="BUILDING">childhood home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  To -- the first time? </span><span class="sentence" id="946">From right after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  No, in 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">ANSWER:  In ’88. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I was with friends, and I was already well rooted, and well established, and feeling -- feeling American, that -- and I came, and I have seen what I have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I -- I did not feel sentimental about the Polish people, because they were denouncing us, and they were destroying us, and they were stealing and taking from us all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">There was a number of Poles that were assisting Jewish people and helping them, there’s no doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But the greater majority was actually waiting to take it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">G -- I'll tell youa little s -- something that will indicate how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">After the war, people were -- late -- later after the war, many people would travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to seek their roots, and find out -- well, there are some people from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that went there, and they went to a -- a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where their parents used to live, grandparents and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And of course, they didn’t find anybody over there, because they were all gone, and there was a little <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where they could maybe identify with, or a remnant of a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But they were talking with people living in -- in very nice <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , they belong to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Not that it -- the Jews were privileged and had those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but jewis -- Jewish people were working hard, and they were a -- a -- improving their lives, and their existence, and everything, and they were very particular about it, so they had better <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and better <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live in, they lived better. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">So they were asking this particular family or person that lived in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , oh, you have a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So they were telling them yes, the Jews had it, now we got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">So the person they wanted was interviewed, and I was asking him how and what and whatever it is, and they were telling them -- which was very, very degrading for -- for me to listen, how they were talking about the Jewish people that were killed, murdered, or whatever it 1s, and left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for them, they felt lucky that they had everything, all their belongings, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Now, for example, they -- there was also a incident where they were interviewing children in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">You want a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> for your back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  No, that’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  That would be nice interview, hi -- I don’t really -- I -- I don’t even care any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Anyhow, so when they ask children, five year old children, six year old children, do you know what a Jew is? </span><span class="sentence" id="966">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">You know how they look. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So one kid says, “Oh yes, I know, they have big ears, and big noses, and they got big teeth, and they are scary.” </span><span class="sentence" id="969">This is how children were able to describe Jewish people, and it’s not li-like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Of course, in Europe, Jewish children, I -- I mean Jewish people were branded having big noses Here, you got everybody, Arabs, the -- the Greeks, the -- there -- whatever it is, everybody’s got big noses, and it was not especially a trait of Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So, that’s how they described the Jewish people over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And it was upsetting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  Did you go to your <span class="BUILDING">childhood summer home</span> on that trip in 1988, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Y -- y -- to my <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">It was not my own, it was where we rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Yes, we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">There was one lady in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> that took me -- her husband was driving, and - course I was able to pi -- pay them, and I brought things for them, because how I found out about the person is also a whole, big story. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">But purely by accident, I was writing by the name to the person, and the -- the letter was received by these people of the same name, and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And they were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I was writing to a Jewish friend that was supposed to live in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , and they received it, and as I started writing to them, I felt obligated to -- so I was writing, I was always putting money in the -- in the letter, because th -- she sounded kind, and nice, and whatever it is, and I knew that they were in- lived poorly. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So then when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , I got in touch with -- with her, and of course I stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I didn’t need anything from them, but they did offer to take me where I wanted to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And since it was like about I would say two hours away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , they took me over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And of course, I was -- 1t was on a [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So, I cannot even describe how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I -- I felt like -- like -- like I could touch everything, and -- and it would be the same, and every -- course, the <span class="REGION">area</span> -- this was where we used to come for vacation, and father used to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">That -- they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and I remember coming and waiting for Daddy to come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6dz</span> , because Daddy used to come for the weekend, you know, like Friday, and then leaving Monday morning, and you know, everything was just -- just like I could touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So I lingered quite a little while over there, and she doesn’t know -- she didn’t know what I was looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And I was looking, and I was touching, and I was doing things and -- that’s all you can do, there is NO way you can possibly recover anything that you have lost, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So it was a very- a very touching and emotional moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And of course, it did not look the same because they have rebuilt the <span class="REGION">areas</span> , it’s -- so I did not find the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was living, but the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> looked somewhat similar to what -- what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And then when we want -- went to the <span class="REGION">area</span> , they had it redone, rebuilt, and <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and everything, I -- basically I didn’t recognize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">But it was a incredible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And then, of course, the way - in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you wouldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Like, for example, I w --
QUESTION:  That’s okay, I’m just stretching.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  I -- I looked at <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you know, the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> where there was lots of business, where they had lots of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and I know fortunately, or unfortunate, or some wartby whatever it 1s, those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and -- and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and -- and businesses belonged to Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So they had signs, for example, dressmaking, or this, hanging on the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the -- of the <span class="DLF">air</span> -- you know, the -- the <span class="REGION">areas</span> in Europe had, like for example, this was a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were bi -- th -- were around, and there was a <span class="DLF">gate</span> here, where you entered, cause that’s how most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were, with a -- a -- cl -- enclosed in <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">So, like on -- at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the -- of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , they had different signs saying who 1s doing business of any kind, like for example shoemaker, this and that, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And then, in the front of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they had <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were saying, like here, whatever the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was selling, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So they still had the same size and everything there, all -- and of course now, <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , they still had the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish restaurants</span> with the same sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Like, for example, a Jewish delicacy is, like for example, have you ever heard of gefilte fish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Did you really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">ANSWER:  Huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Well, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I-It w -- Jewish people eat it -- not -- they can eat it any time they want to, but it was a custom that for Saturday -- Friday and Saturday, you made it, because we did not have refrigerations and so on, and it was -- we were able to keep it in a cold <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a couple days to eat, because we were not allowed to -- to cook, or do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So we ate that, and we still do, so it’s a very popular dish for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">So anyhow, what made me laugh is I saw a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , and it says, of course in Polish, “We serve Jewish gefilte fish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Now, that was in Polish, but I’m translating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And I said, “My God, they didn’t even know how to make it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">You know, if they were not specifically instructed to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And they had businesses, and Jewish people go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And they -- they- | went there too, cause I -- I had no way -- no other way to -- to go to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I wasn’t very fond of -- of them, and bec -- I was hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I still had the feeling of -- of the way they treated us, still had the taste of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So I could not warm up in such a short time toward them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Of course, now, it’s a different generation, and it’s different, so I feel differently about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I feel different, I -- differently about the Germans, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Because first of all, the German society is mixed, also, of different groups, of ethnic groups, in different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">If Hitler we -- were to be alive, and if he saw his -- his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he most probably would commit suicide becau -- because he wa -- wanted -- he was striving to destroy everybody that did not belong in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he wanted a clean <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , only of typical, ethnic Germans, and no mixtures whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And like I said, I said oh my God, here I came to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and they had groups of Indians from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Groups of people from different, other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , from the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> , from here, from that, and then in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> you saw Chinese people, <span class="BUILDING">Chinese restaurants</span> and everything, and I looked, and I said, “My God, it feels like I’m in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And then I said t -- the same thing that I told you about Hitler, I said, “If Hitler saw this, he would drop dead immediately,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So -- so I don’t feel -- I cannot say -- I -- I -- I feel something, but I would not say that I feel about every German the same way, because it’s a different generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And the time when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if I saw somebody that was my age then, I would know that he was somebody in the German army, somebody that oppressed the Jewish people, and -- and whatever it is, so I would feel very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But now it’s entirely a different -- different ge- generation, but of course, you still have the anti-Jewish, you know, anti-Semitic groups and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Like for example, the group here that was supposed to -- you know -- you know, go around -- what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">They -- an-anti-Nazi -- anti-Jews -- Jewish group that was supposed to be here last -- last week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">QUESTION:  Oh, the Ku Klux Klan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, whatever ot -- I thought they were just strictly anti -- Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">On a -- they are a -- a combination of Ku Klux Klan, and whatever, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And, you know what surprises me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">That they came, and they asked for a permit, and the government gave them a permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Now how could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Knowing that these are that kind of people, and who -- why doesn’t somebody that belongs here, really, and is -- is a true American, a -- no matter what religion, whatever it is, do things like that to -- to a -- you know, not demonstrate, but to -- to -- to just announce that they are here, that we are here, we are -- and we are Americans, although we are from there, and from where, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">But why allow them to -- to demonstrate, like they demonstrated already, twice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skokie</span> , I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I mean -- and there were fights, and there were disturbances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Why -- why invite something like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">That’s what surprises me, that we are too lenient here, and too- too much allowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">It shouldn’t be like that, there should be a strict -- I -- I don’t want to put ideas in anybody’s head, but there should be c-certain raw -- laws to make sure that things like that are not going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">QUESTION:  That there should be laws to prevent the ma-marches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">ANSWER:  Definitely, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Al -- the -- any -- any ethnic group, and any group could march, fine, but not to be idealistic about something aga -- which is going to -- to be against our - our American society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Why should they be allowed to -- to be like that, for them to speak against somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">If they are not Americans, let them get the hell out of there, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Forgive me for saying [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  That’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">It -- it must be frightening to you --
ANSWER:  It was frightening to me --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable] your experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">ANSWER:  -- but I -- I almost wish, after I heard what was going on, I almost wish that they -- that they were there to demonstrate, because they had several different groups, large groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">You know, Jews are not supposed to actually demonstrate or do anything public on the Sabbath, and that was on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And they organized a group -- a Jewish group resistance, I don’t know in what ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I don’t think th-they had arms, or anything, but -- but it was a -- a -- a contra -- a acting group, and different other groups, you know, that they -- but there were lots of blacks because the Ku Kluck-ux Klan is against the blacks, and -- and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So there were several large groups that were -- would overcome, no matter how -- and they said they were going to have 300 people only, and four only showed up, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Flor -- four of the Ku Klux Klan showed up, and then they dispersed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But -- so if -- 1f they would have a -- a awful come down to reality, you know, or because they would realize that there’s no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for anything like that to happen, there’s no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to de -- demonstrate, and they -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">But I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Listen, as long as -- as people exist, there is always somebody that will come up with something somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">QUESTION:  Can you tell me you -- in that 1988 visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  -- you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And you were looking for some photographs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">You see, I did speak about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I found -- not photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Th-The reason I was looking for photographs, okay, when they were taking us to -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , where they were taking us to -- to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , I mentioned to you that I only had photographs and things with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">They took those away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Not that they personally came to me and took it away, but I had to leave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">So I had -- I was hoping that they would have the photographs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And they have set up a whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, like a whole <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where, you know, where they were keeping the photographs, because they had a tremendous amount of photographs, because everybody was taking photographs to the -- to -- to the -- to the camp with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">That -- that was the only thing that was important for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So, they found a awful lot of photographs, millions of them, most probably, from people that were brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And so they kept it, they put them all in one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , or two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and then they -- they segregated the photographs, and placed them if they could into all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , if 1t was evidence that it was from this, or another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And that’s where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I found my name, Blass, in several other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I found -- but I did not find any photographs that I could un -- I -- read, unless they were photographs, but you see, I was a very young gi -- I was still a teenager when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So I couldn’t know that much, and remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I remembered only that hit me -- that hit close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And people that I remember were only sort of relatives, and maybe some friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">So, I did not know very much, but when I saw a name, I could tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> -- <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , also, at the trip when I was -- that was when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I made sure th- and I -- I looked, and I found many names, Weintraub, and I found names Blass, but I do not -- I -- I do not remember of any relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Course, Weintraub was not my family, it was my husband’s family, so he most probably would have been able to distinguish better, but I was not able.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1104">ANSWER:  No, healing -- there’Il be never healing, in my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I never will be healed of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I just get accustomed to it, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I ust get a -- to the point where I can talk about it, where if you got me here at -- 10 or 15 years ago, I wouldn’t be able to sit like that and talk to you, but now I -- I want really -- and you can notice it most probably -- I want to get as much as I can out, you know, to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">But I -- I couldn’t do it before, so as be -- as far as being used to it, e -- I-I’m never used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I’m just accepting that it was that way, not accepting that you don -- y -- I don’t know if you understand what I mil -- that this was my past, and this 1s how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Not that’s the way it was supposed to be, or whatever it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So, I am just bearing no special feelings, because I can -- cannot do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I cannot change it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1146">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I still have a whole bunch put away, because this 1s destroyed almost, cause I don’t even take it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I use it in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , and whatever it -- I Just be -- don’t take off this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And here, my -- the hair is already a little clamped up, but you know, I would never throw it away, because in Jewish religion, you’re not supposed to throw away anything that was on a body -- n-not a foreign thing, but something that belonged to the body, it was growing on the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">You are not supposed to throw it away, you bury it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Like, for example they do in -- in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> when they have -- make autopsies, and everything like that, so they -- they put everything in -- in one bag, what’s left over, and they bury it, cause at least they have proper burial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">So, I -- I couldn’t destroy it and throw it away.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">ANSWER:  What? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Oh, s -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I have seen things 1n this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">They were punishing people for doing certain things, for this and that, like for example, I thought that’s a sil -- sa -- simple way -- comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Like they will pan -- punish you because you are using too much water, or watering the <span class="DLF">lawn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">But in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they had all kind of punishments, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Non-Jewish people, and Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">As it happened, some non-Jewish people did something, and it was five or six people, and they hung them on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , the same <span class="BUILDING">market</span> ba -- that I was telling you, where -- where they, during the evacuation that they put us on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And we -- and the Jewish people were ordered to come, and -- and -- and watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">They were forced to watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So here 1s a -- you know, a -- they built a special -- what -- what do you call it, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffold</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Okay, where they -- and they hung the people, and we had to wait until they turned blue, you know, from the pressure of the blood, or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And we watched it, it was the most horrible thing you ever, ever saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Young people -- there was older people, and s -- a couple young people, right in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And they pulled the thing, and that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So, of course, I have seen later on, in different forms, not exactly hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I saw shooting, and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">When they took us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> , you know, and when they took us from the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they put men separately and women separately, and then they were searching us, because they knew that we had valuables, money, because we did not come -- of course, ourselves, we didn’t have much, but people that came st -- still straight from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had things, so they -- and they told people -- us ahead, if they find any money, if they find any jewelry, we’ll be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And sure enough, they searched us, and they found somebody had some money, which didn’t mean anything, you know, paper money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And they found some jewelry, maybe a -- a wedding ring, or this or that, and they shot the people in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">We were -- we were standing there, a woman here, and a woman here, and they shot them right here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">QUESTION:  Do you have friends, or keep in touch with fellow Holocaust survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Not many, not here, but I had those, you know, out of the seven -- seven or s -- eight families over there they were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">But then I have friends 1n other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Like I told you, friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , of course, little by little, they are dying because they were not young, I was one of the youngest ones, so they are all either my age, or a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">So they are not able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">How much longer can you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and -- yeah, I had all over, wherever I came, I w -- used to visit my family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and I used to meet survivors, and -- and I’m corresponding, and I had fr -- friend survivors in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and so on, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">But the only ones that I was able to get in touch with constantly, or -- were the ones in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> , but since I live here, it’s -- I am not seeking them for some reason, because I don’t know them, and just to -- to seek them out for -- for the purpose of talking about it, it’s no sense.</span></p>
