<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Did your family have a long history in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My parents are not French. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My mother came from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> -- she was born in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , lived in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ; came in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in 1918 or ’20 to study medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernivtsi</span> , which was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , used to be <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and he spoke German as his first language. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> also to study medicine and they met in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , and got married, and they came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , where I was born, in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They chose -- they chose that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because once they graduated from <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , they had no money between themselves at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So, they searched for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that would have no physicians, and I don’t know why it was in the north, exactly what was the process, but they found this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in which there were no doctors within about 30 kilometers, or just -- or maybe less than that, 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So, they rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , settled down, and never told anybody that they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was 1935 and they must -- they -- they had a good feeling for what was happening, they were really -- had much forethought, and in fact I think this is what saved our lives, because even though in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> I’m sure people knew we were Jewish, because we were this foreign family; Waldmann was the name, Waldmann (vald-man), however they spoke with an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My grandparents had come from <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> to live with us in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So, we suddenly were a very odd family in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There were no Jews at all anyplace in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But the fact that he was never officially announced that -- when I was a child -- when I was born on -- I have papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I don’t know if it happened in that (?</span><span class="sentence" id="26">sho-let-ry?) </span><span class="sentence" id="27">or not, but I have papers that I’ve been baptised. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I think the only person who knew the truth was the priest in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , who did not speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">No one spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">No -- no one told the Germans that we were Jews, or no one made a concerted effort to get us out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  When you were growing up, did your parents speak to you about your family background and any traditions with respect to religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Well, during the war certainly not, but I didn’t really - no. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I know very little about my grandparents on my father’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They died -- his father died during the war, and his mother just a month after I was born, and my father never, never, never spoke about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I asked a few questions, but I have no idea who they were, what their life was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My grandparents; I don’t know if they were religious or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My grandfather died when I was eight and my grandmother died when I was here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I forget, 40, and she looked old. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">If there was a tradition, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">What happened is when I was 10 I moved to the suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ; my parents followed a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I spent a year with my grandmother there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">When my father came, he joined a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were, the suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Raincy</span> , and it was -- of course in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> we did not have reform, so it was a traditional <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with the woman going upstairs, and then we started going to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I had no -- really no understanding much. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I wasn’t told very much about the religion, I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Believing in God or not, I felt was more sort of my business. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It wasn’t a family thing, and when I was 13-14 I stopped believing anyway, and for me it was more complicated, because I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> when I was little in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and so....
QUESTION:  Let’s back up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Do you have any memory of your life before the beginning of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  None at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What were your first memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  My first memory was being under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with my grandmother holding onto me, to my shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I wanted to get from under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and she was very determined to keep me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The reason was -- later on I was told that there were bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And now, this was not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">At some time during the war, and I don’t know when exactly, although I think I was pretty young. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I must have been about two and a half years old, or three, my mother -- my father joined the army, the French army, as a volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My mother and grandparents left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and we went down to (?</span><span class="sentence" id="59">cam-pare?), </span><span class="sentence" id="60">or someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I’m not absolutely sure what the purpose of the trip was. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My father later said that my grandparents want, and my mother wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Was it because -- was my mother trying to leave, you know, just go away? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The story is unclear. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The marriage was bad, so it might have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Anyway, apparently my father discovered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It’s all very unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I don’t know what the truth is. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They will not tell me what the story is. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But after a while we came back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and my father -- well, the army, the French army, surrendered very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So -- but maybe it was -- I must have been -- it was -- must have been in the beginning of the war, because there was no French army very soon after. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, this is my first memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">After that I don’t have any for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I remembered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , you know, my life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I remember -- I remember really (?</span><span class="sentence" id="76">bar-is-son?).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  After that episode that you just talked about, did you go back then to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Did your family make any effort to change their name? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Or to, perhaps, conceal any suggestion that they might be Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  No, because people already knew them by their name before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Since they hadn’t said they were Jewish, they just kept on with the same pretense, so-to-speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There were no special -- there was no special effort that I can think of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Do you remember the war years in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Did you -- was -- were you touched at all by the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Well, yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Of course, we were touched by -- the things I remember is the food shortages, but they weren’t real food shortages. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">There was no -- there was no chocolate, for instance, or very little sugar and my -- my parents best friend at the time, and my best friend too, owned a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , and I remember I used to go there every day and looking at the chocolate that was displayed, and the candies and wanting some, but everything was rationed, so I couldn’t have them, and so, that was really memory for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were no explanation, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I remember wooden shoes, shoes with wooden soles that were heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I remember one time an American or British soldier on a parachute came down, and I think he died, and the villagers got his parachute, which was stained with blood, I think I saw it, but my mother had taken the - the thread of the parachute and had -- and knitted a jacket for me, sweater, which I absolutely hated, maybe because it had that connotations. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Also, it was slippery, 1t was white, and I remember hating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I don’t ever remember wearing it, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I must have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Do you remember German soldiers in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I used to play with them, with some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We had -- relatively, for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with -- eventually indoor plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I think we had it during the war already. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But we had a <span class="BUILDING">brick house</span> , and the -- we didn’t have a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> -- <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I mean, I used to take <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a tub of water, and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was joined to -- to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there were two of them, and in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door to us there was an old, old lady who lived there with a -- who had a beautiful <span class="DLF">garden</span> full of flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The Germans took that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , took that part of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , made her move, and we stayed in our part. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> too, but not so many flowers, we had strawberries and potatoes and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The two <span class="DLF">yards</span> were contiguous so that I used to -- the soldiers were there -- when they were in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , I used to go there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I remember my mother saying not -- never to eat any of their candies, if they gave me some, because they could be poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I don’t know if I knew, but I knew -- I have a feeling that I knew there was a secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I don’t think I knew we were Jews, especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It’s like I had a feeling maybe they were bad, but I was too young to understand, really, whether they were bad or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The soldiers were not difficult towards - | mean, they didn’t harm the -- the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They lived with us, they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but to a child they looked like different people, but the people, they were not especially frightened, I don’t think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Was there every any fighting in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We had a little bit of -- some men joined the Résistance, I think, but it was more a gesture, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">When -- we didn’t have bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Bombs didn’t fall on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They fall -- fell on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not too far from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Because they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V8s</span> , they had <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , the Germans, and they were sending the V8 to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So, they could bomb quite a bit, but not us. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">There were about 10 kilometers away from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Did your parents seem at all uncomfortable, or nervous, when the Germans were near them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I -- my parents were very anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My father spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You know, this was his mother tongue. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, I think that that was very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I think he treated the German soldiers as well as the French people, and that was helpful for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  What languages did you speak in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  We spoke two languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I spoke Russian with my grandfather and grandmother and my mother, and French with my father and my mother too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Did you have any idea what a Jew was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Had there been any discussion about Jews, to the best of your recollection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  In those....
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Did your parents have any discussions that you might have been present for, or you might have overheard, about what was happening in other parts of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  You know, I don’t think I had any knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or any -- any such thing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I knew the Germans were bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There was killing and bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There was danger and I knew there was something very bad and that the Germans -- we were hoping would leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That’s about as far as it got.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Did you get a sense from the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that they knew something of your family secret, or they were protective of you in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t -- no, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I thought -- we had a privileged position, being the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My father was respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He was a good doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He is, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He was well liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He was quite devoted to his people. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He used to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , by -- first by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , then my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , and then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , all around when people were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">If people didn’t have money he treated them for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We always had food because the farmers would give us things to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, I felt really a little special being his daughter, but not in any different way than that when I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I didn’t know any differently -- I was never confronted by (?._?) </span><span class="sentence" id="160">or I didn’t suffer in any way for being a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  When you look back to those years during the war, are there any episodes, or any memories, that stand out in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">That was at the end of the war; I was -- must have been eight and it was in the spring, or in the summer; it was early in the morning and my -- oh, by that time we had moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The German had to -- Germans took our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So, they made us move, and we moved in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> next door to us, but they were detached to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So, it was really like (?___?) </span><span class="sentence" id="167"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with an old lady, and it was very early, my grandmother, she came in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , shook me, and said, “Wake up, wake up, we’ve got to run.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So, we ran <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and hid in the chicken coup. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">What had happened is -- and my mother was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father and grandfather were running away towards the (?__—??)..</span><span class="sentence" id="170">~ The Germans had come to everybody, but we didn’t know that at first, and they made us go in front of the (? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Merie ?), </span><span class="sentence" id="172">they separated the <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> , they separated the men, the women and the children, they brought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they were going to ship us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because something had happened, I’m not sure what. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The food had been stolen, or someone had been killed, but it was really frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They shot towards my grandmother and me, but didn’t -- didn’t -- missed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But it was pretty scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And I remember so standing in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> for a minute, and the old lady who was with us in her nightgown. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Then I remembered spending some time with the other children and our teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I remember seeing Francois, the woman who had the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , she was very pregnant at the time and she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I also remember crying, but I didn’t know why I was crying, but I saw all the kids crying, so I figured -- I mean, I knew I was feeling bad, but I wasn’t sure why -- what the danger was. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So, that was a significant memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But again, it was not because we were Jews, it was because we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  What happened to the people that the Germans had collected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Oh, they collected all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The priest talked them out of taking us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your early days in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  My first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- I don’t remember very well, whether I was four or five, five maybe, when I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The teacher made us sing songs about Vive Pétain, which my parents must have loved when I’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I had no idea who Pétain was, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I remember we had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , we were planting a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , working in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> on the <span class="DLF">slope</span> next to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I remember loving that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">It was fun.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Mm hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  ...do you have a sense that maybe they weren’t sure?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  I don’t think they were sure in the sense that they had proof, or they had seen any signs of being Jewish, or like Yamika, or any of the traditional signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Of course, there were no <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , you would have to go 40 kilometers to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So, they didn’t have solid proof. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">On the other hand, I think the name is a Jewish name by itself, Waldmann, apparently, Waldmann (vald-man), my parents were -- they had dark hair and- everybody in the family looks more Jewish than I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I’m the only one with this lighter hair and blue eyes, and so, I think everybody suspected. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I think it was pretty common suspicion or knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Was your -- to your knowledge, again, was there any incentive for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ’s people, or the villagers, to pursue this, or to turn you in as a suspected Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Was there any motivation, or incentive, for this kind of act?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It’s -- it’s an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">For -- for most of the people I don’t think there was any incentive, because my father was the doctor and he helped everybody and he was well liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So, there was no reason to kill the village doctor and then be left without anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">On a personal level, it was interesting and more complicated, because much later on, about 10 years ago, I was -- at first I had believed, that’s what my mother had told me that no one knew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">It was a very well-kept secret and that’s why we never had any troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I spoke with a man whose -- whose wife was my father’s mistress, and this was common knowledge in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , everybody knew, and he certainly would have had incentive to get rid of him, and he didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">He -- he was the one who told me when I mentioned that nobody knew we were Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , he started to laugh and said, “Everybody knew, but we were not animals.” </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So -- so, we were saved by the grace, in a way, of this man, and of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Certainly they could have gotten rid of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Did the man say any more to you in your conversation 10 years ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It’s interesting, because we -- we have all -- we are all friendly still. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But it is also a taboo subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The relationship between my father and Francois -- when I speak to Francois, which I do quite often from here, I call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We have never, never mentioned -- she calls my father Dr. Valmon (ph), because they have changed their name since, and it’s all really kind of funny, but I feel that she wants her privacy and it’s not to me -- for me to -- to invade it, although I am very curious and I would like to ask questions about their relationship, and whatever happened back then. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But (? _?).</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  [have very few memories of my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The war years in -- in a way, well it’s a paradox, but when I was 10 and I moved to live in the suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , this was to me a much more painful event than any of the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I liked living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was happy there despite the war, and despite the difficulties, it was a better time in my life, and so, the -- the loss at the same time when I was eight, after the war ended my grandfather died and that was a tremendous loss to me, and -- and I have very, very few memories of -- maybe the two years before he died and none -- none at all between eight - eight and ten and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I have absolute no memories at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It’s all erased. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But I have one memory at the end of the war, I remember, it was -- we were standing in front of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with my family, I think, and two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> came with either American or Canadian soldiers, and the Germans stood in between the soldiers, in between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and they threw their hands up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and their weapons fell down, and the soldiers threw us gum, which we’ve never seen, like, you kept that piece of gum and chewed on it, I think, for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">At night I would put it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">That was the end of the war, and then the woman next -- across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us, she was a spinster. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Apparently, she had been sleeping with a soldier -- with some soldiers, which -- it makes me laugh, because when I was a child I thought of her as so ancient. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">You know, it was like a 90- year-old woman; maybe she was 30 or 40, who knows, but she felt very injured, and so, it was -- it was kind of comical to think of her sleeping with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She got her head shaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  Which soldiers was she -- German or...
ANSWER:  German. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We only had Germans.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  A German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I didn’t know anything about it, of course, until, you know, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Her name was Mademoiselle Levon (ph) and it -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You know, things were done, I think, people got self-righteous in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> afterwards, but I really don’t know much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Unfortunately after that, I have no memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">That’s my last memory.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Why did your family move?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Ostensibly the reason was because I needed a better education. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The truth was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amiens</span> , which was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 40 kilometers away, could have provided a perfectly good education for me as a boarder and I could <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the weekends, but my mother wanted to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">She wanted out of there, which was understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">My father did not, but eventually he gave in, and so, we moved.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  Can you tell me your first memories of your introduction to <span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Unfortunately, they were very, very negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Even though I was, you know, 11 at least, I don’t think my parents had explained to me any -- any of what was -- what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And also, because at the same time I was going to the Girl Scouts and the Girl Scouts were Protestant, the troop, and so, I was -- I went back to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , but this time to the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant temple</span> , which again, I liked, because at least they spoke English -- or French. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You know, I could understand some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But I remember -- and I have it to this day, I am ashamed of the feeling, but I can’t help it, sort of visceral dislike for the way the people looked, the Jews looked, because I did not know that those were the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So, they looked battered and they looked sad and they looked grey, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I didn’t know any of that, and so, they looked awful to me, you know, those people compared to the Catholic who were young and, you know, in good health and certainly didn’t have the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So, I wished I -- I wanted to be like all the other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , you know, legitimately. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I wanted to take communion, I wanted to continue believing in Christ and -- you know, and then -- by then it was a terrible thing, and I was required to hate -- hate the Christians, but I had no whelm of hatred in me for Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Why were you required to hate the Christians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  That was my mother’s call for allegiance, so-to-speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">If I loved her, you know, I was to love her and hate -- love the Jews, hate the Christians, but you can’t make yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So, what happened was the opposite mostly, and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was terribly boring. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I had to sit upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I’m an only child, so I didn’t have any siblings to commiserate with. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I was sitting there with my mother, who didn’t believe in anything, and was, you know, just sitting there and I think she was talking with other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The rituals didn’t -- you know, I missed the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ritual and the respect when you go in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ; you’re quiet, you pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">There, it was just sort of sitting up there watching men in dark suits downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The rabbi, who was mean and ugly. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">His wife, who was -- her hair was -- head was shaved, she was wearing a wig and the wig didn’t fit, and I was just there and I hated it, but I hated it guiltily because I was expected not to, and it meant no -- I didn’t believe in God by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I felt it didn’t make sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And so, I just put in time because I had to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  When did you learn about what happened to the Jewish people in other parts of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  You know, I really stayed away from knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I didn’t want to learn, I didn’t want to know, I didn’t want to be part of it; I married a Methodist, who was not practicing. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It’s not that I -- I hid that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I always said I was Jewish, because I feel you’re born this way, you can’t erase it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But I never identified with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I thought it was more of a curse to be born a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And so, I really didn’t want to know, and interestingly it’s my daughter, when she was 16, she started asking me questions about the Holocaust and I said to her, you know, “I don’t know much and you surely don’t need to know, it’s too horrible, forget it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But she needed to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She started to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I started having nightmares, and so, I needed to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So, I - I started myself to read a little bit and become, you know, more knowledgeable, so I could talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And it was -- she is now 29, so it was a slow -- a very slow progression. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I still, you know, haven’t seen (?</span><span class="sentence" id="381">Schorr?) </span><span class="sentence" id="382">or I haven’t seen that new movie, Schindler’s List, because I am very visual and if I see something like that it’s going to haunt me for months and months and months, if not years. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And I figured, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and I went through it in a daze, I don’t remember much, except for the shoes and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It’s about all I remember -- oh no, the picture, the tower of pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  After the war, did your parents make any efforts to find some of the people, relatives, friends, that they grew up with before they came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">My mother is an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But my grandmother was one of 12, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So, there must have been a lot of people in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but they never made any attempt -- any effort at knowing the family, or I wasn’t -- I didn’t know their name or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">My father was one of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I have an uncle who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , who I think may have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I met him once. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Then -- and then the rest of the family, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I didn’t even know their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So my parents, we -- we really, really cut themselves off entirely from family (? _?).</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  No, except for an occasional remark. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">People don’t think of me -- people who don’t know, don’t think of me as Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I think it’s because Arlette is such an unJewish name, or when I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Personally, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I can’t remember having been directly attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The funny thing that happened -- the funniest thing that happened to me was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and it was a funny story, because I was driving in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with a woman who was a social worker and also a nun, and her friend, and the nun did not know I was Jewish and as we’re driving, some -- some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> cuts her off and she says, “Oh, that’s a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They are so pushy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="404">At which point I thought, “I can’t let you get away with that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So, I said, “I am a Jew’, and she was so embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It was funny, but it was also pretty innocent, I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And so, once in a while I hear remarks like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Some -- some woman who told me about somebody trying to “Jew” her. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">But I very often -- I didn’t -- I knew the woman very slightly, and I -- I don’t pick up on those things, because I don’t -- I feel they’re too stupid, you know, I’m not going to give them -- honour them with a response. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So, I’ve been quite lucky, in retrospect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  When did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  I came in 1962, and I originally came for a vacation, three weeks’ vacation, then I decided to spend a year to learn the language and also to get away, and then I met my ex- husband at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> and within six weeks we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We stayed married 10 years, and have two children, and once I had the children I could not see taking them to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and cutting them -- basically it would have been cutting them off from their father, which I did not want to do to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I’d been enough -- through enough separations that I wasn’t going to impose that on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So, I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I stayed in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  When you say you had been through enough separations that you didn’t want to impose that on them; what are you referring to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Oh, I’m just thinking, you know, about my grandfather and leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , you know, those kinds of disruptions as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">When you’re a child what you need are roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">A divorce is bad enough, but you don’t want any deceptions, you don’t want any changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So, that’s why I stayed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  Did your parents stay married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Mm hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  When you look back to your childhood during the war...
ANSWER:  Mm hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  ...are there any other memories, or feelings, that you have, or anything else that might come to mind at this point that you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  I think, for me, the war might have been like thunder in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You know when you hear thunder at the distance and in a way you don’t know whether it’s going to come closer or move away. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So, there is some sense of danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Like, there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Years later when -- I don’t even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Oh no, there was one thing I never understood exactly why I felt that way, it was listening to machine gun fire, or any kind of gun shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I don’t know if it was from that one experience, or what, but that would absolutely make me shake, and that surprised me, because, you know, I was not really part of any very traumatic events that I can think of, but that -- that - I would have a tremendous response to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I just couldn’t stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Now, it’s getting better, but in movies I’m careful, because it could send me -- it used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I mean, I saw a movie and I shook for a good hour and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So, there was a sense of danger, I think, which I may have repressed or not want to deal with, because there was some other aspects of my childhood that were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I certainly wish it never had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I mean, not only for all the others, of course, but personally that -- I don’t know it was damaging in some ways that I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I think it was the atmosphere that was poisonous, but poisonous in a way that does a child to just absorb, but do not understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  So, you don’t -- you don’t perceive any lasting fallout from your Holocaust -- your experiences during the war too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Well, I think 1t was either thinking back on it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I think for me the most difficult thing was being a Jew, because the experience was so mixed and so poorly integrated, and my sense of identity has been being -- being part of a group I never wanted to be part of, but that I could not leave, nor would I want to leave for sense of guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I do have a sense of guilt, that’s one of the reasons I didn’t really want to tell the story because I feel, what do I have to tell, you know, so many people have suffered so terribly, as I know from the group here and children survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You know, I didn’t suffer, or -- why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">There 1s this -- this survivor’s guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It’s real. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It’s a real thing, and it certainly had a profound effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">A sense of insecurity. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">You know, you never know when you could be asked to move, or asked to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">You never know if a bomb will fall on your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">But I think it was both, it was the war in general, which all the children, everybody in my time suffered from, and it was personal in the difficulty of being a Jew and having such strong identification with -- with a man, with Christ, with a religion which basically also doesn’t exist very much; it’s an idea in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">The <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> , I wouldn’t be part of it if you paid me at this time, because there are many things I think they are doing which are not (? _?), </span><span class="sentence" id="456">because they didn’t fight the Germans either very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So, it’s a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that’s sort of -- it’s sort of no-man’s-land, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d like to add before we conclude the interview today? </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I did want to ask you a little bit about your -- your life in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and your professional career. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Would you mind sharing just a few minutes with me on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I think my career -- I have -- I was lucky to -- to have found -- to have found a career that really met a lot -- a lot of needs for me, and in which I have a sense of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Having made a little difference, I worked with adults most of my life as a psychotherapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I’m now going to work with children, which I look forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I think I have a sense of -- a sense, a need, a wish, of -- to help those who are less fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">The greatest pain I have- it’s funny, it’s interesting because it has nothing to do with the war, or maybe it does, is of being in exile. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I did not really wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I left mostly to escape my parents, not the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I can’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I’d go back, but I cannot go back because my children are here, my life is here, and all I know, I think, I survived much better than other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And well, you know, like many in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , Jews are not Jews, we all pay the price for the time we were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  Are your parents still alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Could you tell me their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  My father’s name is Joseph Valmon (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In 1955, °53, I don’t know, something like that, he changed his name from Waldmann to Valmon (ph) when he became a French citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And my mother’s name is Fanni Valmon (ph), and (?__?) </span><span class="sentence" id="481">was her maiden name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  One final question.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  Mm hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  Did your mother also practice medicine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  My mother practiced medicine, but only in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">She never -- she was -- stayed in an auxiliary role. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">She never went to see patients <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but patients came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she practiced that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">She was not a very (? _?) </span><span class="sentence" id="493">practitioner. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">She preferred not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But she -- she did help my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He was really the main one, person, in terms of work.</span></p>
