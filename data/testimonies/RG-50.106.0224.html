<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My father’s name in Polish, it was Simon Prejs, spelled the way the Polish people would spell it, P-R-E-J-S. https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014

<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salt Lake City</span> and I think he 1s somewhat well known in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> circles and he certainly well known in political circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014
QUESTION:  Let’s talk about your family in general now. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Were your parents religious in any way, observant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yes, they were observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we observed of course the Friday evening services. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My father would say a Shabbat with wine and there were as I recall occasional, I don’t know how frequent, visits to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I would say my father was, was not, he certainly was not in the conservative rungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I would say today you would say he was probably a, an observant Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But I don’t know how else to characterize.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  More liberal, would you say a liberal Jew, well whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  I couldn’t judge that because at that time I was only ten years old and I would not know whether we are liberals or what.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  My first memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I think my first memory would take me back to a time when my brother was about three and I would have, and since I’m three years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I would have been about six. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And that was only because it was very dramatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There were, there was a <span class="DLF">sandbox</span> https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014 where my brother and another child were playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And the other child dug, whatever it 1s, a rather deep <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">sandbox</span> and his head somehow got trapped in it and it was a tragic death. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I always remember that is sort of a starting point for all my memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The other, I do recall quite vividly of course, I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was transferred from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The story 1s well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And it was a period when I wore a yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">All of the portion of history is well documented. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I was —
QUESTION:  Before we get to that, before we will certainly get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Was your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> a mixed, Jewish, non-Jewish neighborhood?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Did you have any non-Jewish friends or were — https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014
ANSWER:  Yes, and my father’s closest friend was a man named Troutshold [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He was a, I don’t know whether he was a business associate, but he was certainly a close friend and that man was a non-Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was mixed?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well that’s hard because I would not be able to place them by year. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">At that point it just happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Like one day we were told that we were no longer going to go to that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I can’t remember what the explanation was that was given for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I can’t remember the explanation for why we were identified with a yellow star and a coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And —
QUESTION:  What year was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Do you remember what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  No, I would not remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I would say it was about 37. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I would say it was at least a year before Kristallnacht.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  I, no I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I don’t want to make a story up. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I really don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">No I don’t, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I do remember that within the family, events were uneasy and there was a lot of talk about what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But I just overheard that because I couldn’t contribute to what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  You were very young, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I do think what is relevant here though is that my father as early as 36 and 37 had anticipated at least something might go, might turn bad and he had financed the travel of two brothers to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , who were --

<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  How did that feel to a young boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">What did it mean to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Do you have any recollection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  I don’t know what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I just sense, I suppose I sensed some degree of segregation but I don’t remember being, I don’t remember any emotional trauma from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My father was not a man who easily got upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we, there was some alarming talk but I can’t remember that within the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was any great, what is, any great fear about the events in progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014
QUESTION:  As you said, the first difficult time for you was Kristallnacht right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Pardon me, yes, Kristallnacht, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That I remember clearly because I was, I so to speak in on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">That is this man Troutshold, my father’s friend, was the one who rapped on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and informed Margaret and Simon that something is up and that they were destroying the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And my father and my mother and I went down to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that was closest to where we were living and when we got there the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had been in fact destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There were people milling around and we spent the next hour salvaging things that the looters had left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And those are the things we ended up leaving the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Shirts and some pants and other things that were left behind from the looting after the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had been ransacked.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Well I wasn’t so much frightened as that I was confused that we were picking clothing out of shattered glass and that was and I did not know really what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Except there were people milling around and the story eventually was pieced together so that I had an understanding that there were people who hated Jews and were destroying their property. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was a rather simplistic explanation but I was ten years old and my father had no reason to detail all, the nature of what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Did you have any emotional feelings when you saw a swastika? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Emotional reaction to the s, no, I except that I began, I clearly associated it with the events of Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And between that time and the period that we left and surely <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there were certainly a lot of what is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I can’t say angst, but I can say that there was a lot of caution going https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014 out. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And of course, being identified as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Because when you went out you wore the coat that had the star which identified you.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Now Kristallnacht is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And then what’s the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well the next of course was the hurried efforts to put our lives in order by figuring out what we're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I don’t think, I was not in on the decisions that led us to flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We, in I think it was in April, just before the announcement that the German policy on letting Jews out changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Up to I think some period into 39, the German policy still was to let Jews flee if they left their property behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Were your grandparents alive at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Both grandmothers were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">My mother’s sister Hilda was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My other father’s brother Adolf and his son were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And so I knew all of those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  They were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Yes, they were all, they were in the family we have not only photographs of us all together, but there were a number of occasions when I can recall the two grandmothers would be in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and the brothers would be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  You said your father and mother were trying to make arrangements.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What month of 39 was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Pardon me
QUESTION:  Do you know what month that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Yes it would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You can identify the month because it was just a month or so before the German policy closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They no longer let Germans flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So we managed just to be one of those who at the last minute was able to still get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I can’t remember what exactly month that German policy changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We left with whatever suitcases that we could fill with the things that we salvaged from, either from the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> or from our own personal home possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  What did you take as a young boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Did you take anything special that you loved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Oh no, I don’t remember taking anything special. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Books, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Books or toys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  No, I couldn’t, I can’t remember any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It was a hasty departure and the, I have only the vague recollection how we got actually to the <span class="DLF">port</span> , but I do have a recollection of being at the https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014 dock and looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> which was called the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ulm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It’s still in the registry of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">U-L-M and it looked very large to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But in retrospect, it was a rather small 12,000 ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Did your extended family come with you, your grandmother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  No, no one came. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And there was concern about what would happen to the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We talked about that and, and there was the notion that somehow if we got out, we might be able to help the others get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Well at that time of course there was still the possibility of getting out but a month or two later there was no longer that possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  You get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and where did you —
ANSWER:  Well the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was headed into the Caribbean and it was called a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">banana boat</span> and it only went into the Caribbean and I think in the tropical areas of <span class="REGION">Central America</span> , picked up bananas. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It had racks in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> for holding bananas and we lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I say lived, isn’t the right word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Existed.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Then what happened, then keep going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Well the — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> was of course, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> partly because I spoke German and the notion was it was one of the German communities in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Well it might have been but by the time I got there 1t was one of the Polish communities in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and my German was of rather unhelpful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I might say I was not well prepared for selling industrial chemicals. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And after I had been on the job for about three months, I was taken off the payroll because after three months I was supposed to earn my way on commissions. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And there were no commissions because I wasn’t selling anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And let me ask you before I go much further. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Are these things that I’m telling you of interest and they get too personal and I don’t know how deeply to go into some of these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  I just generally want to know the track of your life from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I don’t need, go on —
ANSWER:  So ITenrolled at <span class="BUILDING">Marquette University</span> which is a <span class="BUILDING">Jesuit school</span> and there I was again back to my, with was my Catholic associates and then having visited all my prayers and through all of them my study on the historicities of the Gospels and went through all of the Gospel teachings which gave me some insight into the nature of that religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And also it was some ways amusing because I was a member of a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> by this time and I was teaching a class in <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And in fact, I taught a course called the ethics of the Fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I don’t know if you know or what and then during the days I worked and at nights I was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marquette</span> studying the Gospels. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was sort of an unusual period.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  It was a long period because I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But anyway I finished in 59. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014 decided that I would not continue to sell industrial chemicals. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I didn’t think that’s the future for me, although I was earning very, earning good money by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I had three children and I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I certainly didn’t — I was certainly considerably better off than I ever imagined. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But following industrial chemicals didn’t seem to be a fitting occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  Then what did you do, where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Oh, I decided that I wanted to become a consultant. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I can’t remember why exactly I wanted to become a consultant but I thought I was reading a lot about consulting work and I had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I had heard of firms like McKinsey and Booz Allen Hamilton and I visited these <span class="BUILDING">firms</span> and I — the man at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">McKinsey</span> was particularly nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">He advised me to get an MBA and he thought that McKinsey might be interested in a young man who is ambitious, who had an MBA. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And so I applied for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and of course several other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and, for my graduate work. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Well again, as things turn out I was accepted at three very fine <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">MIT</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> rejected me. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So I eventually chose <span class="BUILDING">Cornell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I had been accepted at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I chose <span class="BUILDING">Cornell</span> and became a labor economist or at least the beginning of a labor economist. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And then after I finished my work, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">McKinsey</span> and told them proudly how I had finished <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And the man reminded me that he thought that I should have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And so I never did get to work for McKinsey.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  And then you stayed in that <span class="DLF">field</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  Well I, I needed work and as it happens the -- I saw something about a position opened with the US Atomic Energy Commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I had no idea what they were but I applied and I was flown to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , <span class="REGION">New Mexico</span> where they had their main operations office. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And I had interviews and was selected for a job with the A, it was called the AEC, the US Atomic Energy Commission and so I started what I would say my second full working career.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  I established, when I say after the Kennedy legislation which created and later supported community mental health centers, I my job at <span class="BUILDING">Peat Marwick</span> and under the contract was to implement that law and I had — I had been creating most of the community mental health centers that were established at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Also legislation for what were called <span class="BUILDING">family planning clinics</span> and I headed up most of the development and implementation of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And so there are numerous, at least six major public initiatives which I was able to direct. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And during that period I was with KPMG, Peat Marwick, later became KPMG.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  And then after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  I was ambitious and so I thought I’d open up my own <span class="BUILDING">consulting business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And four or five years up til 1980 I had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and had my name on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">There’s an interesting story that goes with that but if you don’t want to get too deep into stories, maybe I could skip it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  Until one day I got a letter asking me whether I would like to be interviewed for a position 1n, with the International Atomic Energy Agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And so again there were interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They needed someone with my earlier background in weapons business to be part of the team for negotiating the extension of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And that took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And so in 1989 I was on my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And for almost three years, three and a half years was involved in various activities here. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I had the status of a diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So I was engaged in negotiations on various issues which have to do with what they called inspection regimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">These are the regimes which enable us to send inspectors into <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> to look for, to account for the use of nuclear materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  Are you working now? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Are you still actively doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  No I, after finishing my diplomatic work, I met a lady here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> who was of Polish origin of all things. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And who by chance, whose father by chance, although he came from a <span class="NPIP">location</span> only ten kilometers from where my father was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Isn’t that something? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">It’s amazing; that really 1s amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014 Of course, there is a big difference in age. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Between that but the <span class="NPIP">locations</span> were only ten kilometers apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">The -- and so I decided not to return to that nice casita with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">cottonwood tree</span> and all the chickens running around and all that Native American art and settled in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And here I resumed my practice as an economist and as a consultant.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I can answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">That’s not too difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">In 1989 when I had the chance to come here, at first I was going to reject the offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I really had no reason to come back to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I knew of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ’s complicity in the war, even though they say they were a victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And so at first I was going to reject coming here. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">But I thought it might open up a new chapter of my life and I might actually learn something about the past by coming here. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And so I did come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">After I’d been here about a year, year and a half, I was actually invited to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> by the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , whose name I’ve forgotten for the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And I met with the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He gave me more than an hour of his time. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And we talked about that period that I remembered Kristallnacht and things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And I found that I wish I could remember his name, but he’s quite well known and I can easily identify him because of the —
QUESTION:  ’'m more interested in your thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  But I was impressed by this man’s willingness to talk about the conditions that existed at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And I had the sense that he wasn’t that there were no alibis and that there was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And it wasn’t a conversation where he expressed particular pity either, which I don’t need. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It was simply a rather straightforward very professional discussion of the period of history which was, which the damage done. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Lives he mentioned that people in his own family — they’re not Jews but people in his own family lost lives and in the course of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And it changed my attitude toward the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But you know there is this question about for how many generations we should hold our — past generations we should hold our people — or future generations should hold accountable for the things that happened in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I don’t know if you know in the Jewish tradition we try the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">But I’m inclined to think now that I don’t know whether <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has come fully to terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I don’t know what fully to terms means. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I think they’re more the terms, have come more to terms with the events of that period than the Austrians have. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">The Austrians still haggle over what paintings to return to Jews and whether prove, Jews can prove enough so that they will return a painting that they are particularly fond of. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I don’t know if you follow that kind of news. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2014 And, but I do find that when I disclose to the Austrians that I am Jewish, because I am on the circuit, I make lectures on, people ask about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I don’t particularly have to hide, I don’t hide what I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And often I will actually disclose it when I think it’s appropriate to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And when I do, do so most of the people are interested in a rather sincere way about what my experiences were. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Almost like the way you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And they ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">What do I remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="806">What were my feelings and I’m a bit of what you would call an anachronism or maybe that’s not the right word that there aren’t too many people who can talk first-hand about Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And when I, for instance I will meet on May 13", in I guess a few days with the director, president of the National Bank of Austria, Claude Reidel. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And, Klaus Reidel. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And whenever I meet with him and he’s very interested in what my recollections are and what my feelings were about the events that took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So I sort of I’m not as, I don’t think I ever was bitter, but I am certainly, I certainly don’t have a chip on my shoulder about those events of the past.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Second I think that the Holocaust is not the equivalent of a tombstone. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">A tombstone goes with the person who’s buried and if we, the Jews that are buried as a result of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> deserve their tombstones I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Commemorative things. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I think the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> represents not a sort of a tombstone for a memorial stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I think it’s a, it’s designed to perpetuate a historic, not to perpetuate but a memorial
