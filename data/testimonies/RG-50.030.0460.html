ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your home life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born to a physician and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">We had a very assimilated home life. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was the youngest of four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , as far as I could get in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was all under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling, at least my formal schooling, came to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And at that time, one had to think slowly, about preparation for leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Vesters, strikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My first job, as I always wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl’s orphanage. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It was partly my job to help prepare the children for a life that we really couldn’t foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , prepare -- English -- to prepare for eventual immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and tried to learn shorthand and typing. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I never did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I worked in <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , but then a letter came from a colleague in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out -- correction, not so many, but some. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I decided, against anybody’s advice, to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for the German Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It’s interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from the very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I prepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we don’t have to go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because one of my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me, and I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And at that point, I got my passport back, and left in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Again, I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and so it was a bit of a family reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It’s all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And my brother from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , where I als -- also had a brother, came. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He was a lawyer here, working for the office of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Anyhow, he picked me up, and we came together to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And it was a little funny story when I arrived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">People who thought I’d gone into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my aunts, etcetera, had given me, of all things, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tea kettles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was surrounded by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tea kettles</span> , and the customs official looked at me and said, “Golly, what do you want to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Trade with the Indians?” </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That’s the beginning of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  When did you arrive to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  In 1937, in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  So, just briefly maybe, we’ll turn back to your years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and could you tell me a little bit more? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Was your family observant of religious holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  No, we were very assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Yes, proforma -- it’s a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we were an upper class, very well known family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And what you did was always being looked at by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But, I should mention my mother -- and I’ve inherited that from her, liked to help people, and she always volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And she had what she called office hours in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she would counsel people. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , listening to these stories, and that’s why I decided I wanted to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And another -- and that’s the last story of my past, we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a little money in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was alone in the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy bear, and said that, “He’Il keep you company.” </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I didn’t want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So my father, who was a little impatient, said, “Well, you are but spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">There are many poor children who have no teddy bears.” </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I said nothing, and I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Day before, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, “Let’s walk slowly here,” no, correction again, “‘let’s walk fast, because this is where the poor children live.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, I thought, teddy bear, poor children. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> with my chocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy bear into her arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Once later, my mother was playing <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and one of her partners said, “Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter, and gave her a teddy bear.” </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I always say, “I have spent my life giving teddy bears to the wrong people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  You said that your family was a total of seven children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Four. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Four children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Oh, I thought you said that you were one of seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">One of four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  The youngest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  And briefly, would you tell me what happened to your family members, your immediate family members through the war years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Yeah, we were very lucky, we all got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We have never been together again as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">My mother left a little later than I did, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , which she lived -- let’s see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to take her out with the help of the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He came, and he was politically quite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well known writers, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">One of them, Eric Musam, some people may be interested him, he was later killed, but he got him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  And did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism when you were growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Who hasn’t? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Yes, and I only gi -- I had all -- I -- I had, as everybody else did, I remember well my first encounter, when I was, well, maybe 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I had a girlfriend, very blonde, and very Aryan, and her father was an architect, and we were quote, best friends, end quote. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And from one day to another, she said, with tears in her eyes, “My father forbade me to play with you any longer, because you are Jewish, and he belongs to a certain German organization, and would be a danger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl.” </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That was my very first -- and, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you met it everywhere, from your greengrocer -- and you met the other, too, people who stood up for you, and perhaps a most outstanding one was we had a super in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he denounced my mother to the Secret Police, and denounced me, too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend, which was against the Nuremberg laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, I mean, we had our share of this, but compared what later on happened in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , it’s all chicken feed. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">No [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I think we can perhaps move on then, to your early years in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and what you did when you first arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Any striking first impressions that you had, and that you’d like to recount?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Cause <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is overwhelming if you come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my family -- I had an aunt here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social Democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They were very nice to me, but I didn’t want to play the role of a poor relative, that’s just not in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I had a Quaker friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , who was a teacher of music. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And we had been through a lot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> together, we had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So I phoned her, and said, “Etta, please get me a job, any job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And she came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I did a little a-around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I’m really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were actually lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I took a little bit care of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And money I didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Furs I had, but no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I have a usable brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And he thought to get anywhere in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I would have to study, and get at least a Bachelor. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good <span class="BUILDING">American college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> , which has helped me for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And they again were very nice, because they believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I had my examination for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which I didn’t have, but I said I had lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I could make up for it in an examination, I passed with very good grades, and so I got through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> in two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That, of course, was a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And that way, I got through <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I just missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I’m really angry about, because I had the cooking to do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I minored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And later on, I took psychology.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  So when you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you were also focused to some extent on social work again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Never left my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I did not tell you that before I even mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> , I had gone to the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had told me I could not study social work if I wouldn’t have an America Bachelor. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was very different times, and that was one reason why I was so glad to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And the day I had my Bachelor, I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , I say, “Here I am, please let me in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They were very psychologically oriented at that time, and they seriously said to me, “Well, you know, you will have to work with people who know pain, and suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And to know that, you have to know it yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Did you ever have any suffering and pain?” </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I said, “Yeah, I just left my family in Europe, I make a very precarious living here. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I’ve met many good things, but I’ve also met [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Did you have much fear in you when you arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Do you recall having that kind of emotion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  I recall having a lot of anxiety. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Not so much fear, which is very much related. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I didn’t think I would not get through, that never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But I didn’t know how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  And what did you continue to hear about developments in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Europe during this part of your schooling, and your early years in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I was dead sure, if I’d ever become a citizen, I would go and try to help rebuild. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I felt guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was safe, and my friends were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I was in close contact with the Quakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , even could -- and get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And they, at that time, were starting their so-called refugee section, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And so I knew particularly about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but if I’m very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience it was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your boyfriends, about whatever the day brings. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Yes, it’s all going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and you also -- at least I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, “Why didn’t these people get out?” </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Later on, I [indecipherable] they couldn’t, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It came back more and more when I -- at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee section</span> , as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , people pleading for so-called affidavits. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And while I was working with Quakers, I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Now, imagine this German Jewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was sent to farmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So we had a great time not -- of learning each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They showed me their <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk with thee and thou, as the Quakers does. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And whatever they showed me, I’d never seen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, “Did thee ever see a cow?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  So when were you in <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  The latter I can answer first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Probably in °38 - ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It’s vague, but I think so, because ’39, I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , so 1t must have been before ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">What was your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  And what were you trying to accomplish while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I was charged to get affidavits of support for refugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And somebody had to guarantee that they would not become a charge of welfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I got quite a few affidavits, because I could plead my cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I had seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I did that, really until I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , working for the Quakers, being a counselor in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Now, this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quaker camp</span> for refugees who had already arrived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  And where was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyak</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Can you give a little more description of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the individuals you helped there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The people who were there, were very often couples where one <span class="NPIP">part</span> was not Jewish, or a -- some were political refugees, and not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The Quakers helped everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The majority had Jewish blood, it was not that they were -- I don’t think we had an Orthodox Jew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But it was comparatively young people, it were majority professional people, who needed retraining in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and the director of that camp was a minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That was a -- an interesting experience for me, and I learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was run like all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , there’s lots of language classes, and community interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Some sport, but very little, the people had other interest at that kind than sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Was a lot of writing to find where relatives were, and you [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There, you never forget -- forgot that there was a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I mean, not the war [indecipherable], but there was liberation for a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And it had the most intellectual group that I’ve ever met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Oh gosh, I have another camptery. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Okay, a -- and I know that I wrote what I called a national hymn for that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which we sang for [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I can’t sing, I don’t know music, but I wrote it. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And --
QUESTION:  Do you remember it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I know where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sky Island</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hudson</span> , and that was a refrain of it, everything was beautiful in Sky Island of the Hudson, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I threw all that stuff out, today it would be interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Approximately how many refugees were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  I really can’t -- can only guess a hundred, wild guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  And how long were you working there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Two summers. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It only existed during the summer, for people who couldn’t afford a real vacation, and who needed an effer -- American atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The food was so American, they had difficulty in eating -- well, it was very well meant, very human, and was in the estate of an American psychiatrist, who still is around, Dr. Viola Bernard. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">She still may be [indecipherable] the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">She’s not Jewish, but very, very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And she had a beautiful estate, and the faucets were sort of heads of lions, so you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Okay, so much for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And after one summer, in °39, I started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I had to run interesti -- I had many lovely, lovely experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But one experience that fits is, I was a -- later on -- is that true? </span><span class="sentence" id="189">No, doesn’t happen in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , comes a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So I graduated, made many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Was interesting to me, that there, we really didn’t know who was Jewish, and who was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You know, that was such a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I was a rarity at that time, because refugees weren’t so many at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I know, I get along with people, and I had a great time, and eventually I graduated, in ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And there was no question I’d go to school of social work, I got another scholarship, which meant another job on the side, but these things are typical for an immigre. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I kept my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , I rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- separate <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And began to be more involved with refugee questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I had a room mate who was very much on the left political, and didn’t let me forget that it was Fascists who did all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And we were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And I always get involved in strange things, so I was -- well -- political involvements, so stay out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And I found life very interesting, got much more Americanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Had a very easy time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My placement was with the children’s agency, and it all seemed to me very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I don’t know why they made so much fuss about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The only bad thing was, I had in the morning, and in the evening, to travel for over an hour, through all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So much for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I still was in touch with the Quakers, I still have them out with the refugee faction. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I always have had a great respect and love for the Quakers, but never wanted to convert, because I always thought, you don’t run away from something that’s difficult into something that’s easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So the Quakers were asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Don’t hold me to the dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Not 41, I had a -- nonsense. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="212">43, I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There is something I don’t remember, and that’s what -- I think right after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I went to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span> , because I was more and more interested in psychiatric social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And I spent one difficult year in a <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sikesville</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And that was a -- <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of about 3,000 patients, and five physicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And there I became very much aware of Europe and it’s difficulties, because the majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And there were also one Jewish physician who was American. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I told you, I get involved, sometimes I also in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I became, in my free time, the director of the recreation for our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp of-</span> of conscientious objectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I could wro -- write a book about it if I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And that was not liked by the American attendants, because they had their husbands in the war, here was this one Jewish female, and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty, and messed up situation, I was in between vics. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And the Jewish doctor, saw me going with my CO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christmas carols. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He called me to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and sa -- and said, “If I wouldn’t be punished, I would spank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">You are no [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You tried to be a Christian,” -- which I never tried, I just like to go around with some [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And he gave me <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So I got it from <span class="REGION">Jewish side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me about your reaction to the start of World War Two, while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  What, of course, I remember first of all, was that I was suddenly an enemy alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I’d been thrown out of my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and find myself an enemy alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I could not have a camera, I could not have a short wave radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And for every trip, I had to get permission from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , which means my brother, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , working for the government, I could only go and see him with special permission, which I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I didn’t go too often, but he came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I -- these are individual things. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">My outstanding best friends at that time, were the director of the labor relations board in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And they were ardent pacifists. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, “How do you feel about it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And impulsively, I said, “I’m glad that,” -- now this is when <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> got into the war, -- “that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power.” </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And they looked at me in disgust, and said, “How can you be glad about any war?” </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I said, “Is it better when people are slaughtered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Do you want that to go on for eternity?” </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So we had a very long discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They were pacifists. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I had been a pacifist for a good time of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">As a matter of fact, when in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I was the youngest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So, that will always be my interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But that’s my outstanding memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn’t get letters from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I had heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But when I was five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So, I knew what was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I don’t know, I was in an <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> , in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> no, in the <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span> , and we got very little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And then, of course, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or from my sister in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me this question. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I don’t remember if the letters were censored or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I don’t think I ever was out of contact with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I looked -- I kept my mother’s address, but not the war time, one, so I -- I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I remember how I threw my camera into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , because I wasn’t permitted to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Why I didn’t give it to an American colleague, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I -- I did not have too many Jewish friends while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had roo -- <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish room</span> mates, but one was American, and as I implied, very much on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The other was also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and very assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war would be over. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But we also tried very hard to live from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Now, this changed for me in 1943 or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I’m really not good with figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">When the War Education asked me -- War Education Authority, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> that had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and awful ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And there’s barbed wire around. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It always amazes me, the only time I personally have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> with <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> , and real <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Because I was always insisted on living right in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> because you can’t be of help if you are billeted in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in - yeah, it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but were not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">One was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perramonte</span> , just for your information. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We had some Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And Dr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the government, had been sent to Europe to select from different camps, a thousand refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">These had been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was starving, and he would at -- at least take a thousand mouths out. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Well, it’s really not a very bright idea, but it helped a thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn’t know if they could stay in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And what that means psychologically, you can’t do it -- can’t imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Actually, one was sent back because he was insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">The others eventually stayed here, in ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I’ve met them over the -- my career in social work, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And that was my first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ex- no -- well, the other was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">vacation camp</span> , this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with all the difficulties of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">People not having any privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Some people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">One person died shoveling snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The administration was blamed for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I got an [indecipherable] to later <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> life. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The food was always [indecipherable], it’s always in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">People have to have an outlet for all their feelings, so they fight for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We had a few birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> run by a Jewish laf -- doctor, who was supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an MD in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I had an operation, and I remember my refugee doctor very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">However, it went all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It was an ope- operation, an appendix, and they found an ovary was -- they took out an ovary that shouldn’t have taken out [indecipherable] forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And I stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , almost through the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I think I left a month before. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">People eventually got the permission to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Most of them came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Ruth Gruber co-wrote a book about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , “Safe Haven.” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I disagree with the book, but anyhow --
QUESTION:  Can you explain why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  I -- Because she saw a <span class="NPIP">side</span> from the point of view of a rather optimistic American. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">She worked very hard, I mean, she really -- she helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">These people wouldn’t have been here without her, but how she described the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I don’t quite agree with. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I saw more conflict than she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But ac -- but we are still good friends, I still see her, and Oswego people have also [indecipherable] word?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  Community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Community. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They meet once in awhile, cause we all are old people now. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And some of them died, some of them have grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">The grandchildren I met in my last job, and some of them, because in that job, among other things, I ran a scholarship committee for refugee, and second and third generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And suddenly, some of my Oswego grandchildren turned up. [</span><span class="sentence" id="318">indecipherable], they are very bright, and good students. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Europeans know how to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So, you see, that’s why I say my life is so interwoven, one with each other, Quakers from all occasional [indecipherable] etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Can we go back momentarily to your very first experiences, helping refugees, and that’s when you were working with the Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And could you give a little more detail as to how you started to get involved in that kind of work? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Was it through the friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , or someone else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  I tell you, my girlfriend, whom I knew from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , was a Quaker, and was a daughter of the deeding Quaker in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Somebody writes a book about it, and interviewed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, through her, it was natural that I met other Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I met a professor of social work, Hetta Calls, from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She was a professor of social work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryn Mawr</span> , and for quite some time I stayed in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she was a president at that time, or the founder of this refugee section, and she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And she introduced me as her secretary to the American Friend Service Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus Jones, and Kelly, and learned to loved, and admired a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And met my first -- I was a refugee of- myself at that time, really in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="332">What I had to do as a secretary was really mostly writing letters, trying to search for people, trying to get affidavits, trying to talk to lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">A little bit helping people to adjust. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Helping them to get lessons for car driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Women didn’t really know how to drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I don’t know how to -- not today. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And it was not that common in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The refugees at that time are mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Oswego</span> , but what I imagine <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> was pretty much German Jewish [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Where was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was run by the Quakers, the two summers? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Where exactly was that located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyak</span> , N-y-a-k, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It’s how -- it’s about an hour from here, upstate, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westchester</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So, after that experience, the experience with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the two summers in a row, then eventually, you were able to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> with refugees, and that work there, what was your daily responsibilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Taking histories, in case people could stay in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Taking histories for the sponsoring agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Helping people to adjust to camp life. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">No European knows <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And that men should do the cooking, don’t tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And to see that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> functioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We were just -- every religion had a -- a -- [indecipherable] what’s the word?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Every religion had a place of worship of some kind, or --
ANSWER:  No, it had a person from every religion was a social worker. [</span><span class="sentence" id="353">indecipherable] one wa --
QUESTION:  Some representative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Yes, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And also a -- a Jewish agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I was really quick repre-representative there. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The Jewish agency admaroon became my best friend, she just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And the Catholic had one, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And there were lots and lots of adjustment question. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">People had left their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , didn’t know where the other person was, the family was torn. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">A -- and as I say, we had to take very complete histories for the government, no personal really, but there you had to know the facts, and the facts were not too well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And -- and they had had the camp experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and some had illnesses, and some had venereal illnesses, and we suddenly had the last [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You had to ha -- make the things work, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The idea, to be behind wired bar -- barbed wire, we had -- we had to be in this free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So it was really psychiatric social work, and immigration work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  How many --
ANSWER:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  How many other people were working in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> approximately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  Hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We had about -- we had a director, and a deputy director, American. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We had about four social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We had a head nurse, and I think some other nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We had teachers, we had -- no -- no teachers there, the children could go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">It was a fight, but we got to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We were always fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I think that’s about what was there, and then all sorts of people came from other <span class="NPIP">agencies</span> to study these strange animals from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But the biggest group was Polish, and the second group was Yugoslav, and they couldn’t stand each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And we also had a non-Jewish prince from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , who got into fis -- a fist fight with somebody else, because they both thought they were princes. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I mean, anything and everything possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We did have a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , we did have lectures, we did have good concerts, there were good musicians among the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It was daily living. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Was a lot of anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  What would you say you were able to learn about the war, or other events taking place in Europe, from the refugees, that you had not learned elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  I did not know that there were camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I did not know the war conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="429"><span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> had an awful secret pol -- police, Usetasha. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I had not known of that existence, and the madness, and the badness of the war was really beginning to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me, when I heard these people who had escaped by night over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Who had sent children to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The living with danger, the constant being afraid some knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> will be the secret police, and you'll be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It became all a reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And, of course, I was there when Roosevelt died, and that had a terrific effect on the camp population. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They were really depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It’s something that is now a -- people don’t want to acknowledge, American Jewish people, that Roosevelt made many mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But he also was a big hope for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And, of course the ones who came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> loved him for that in -- invitation, and they were devastated when he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They couldn’t know that Truman did much more perhaps, in the end, but it was really a -- a major depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I always felt that all the deaths they had seen in Europe were suddenly coming to life again by the death of Roosevelt, who had sort of been a power figure to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So all that made the whole time much more real to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I -- also, I didn’t have as much of a private life. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> things were going on, but here you read the papers much more, and people had a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but they had lost their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You saw, actually the people. [</span><span class="sentence" id="445">indecipherable] had been in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the doctor had refused to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And for the first time you really heard it, from word -- by mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So yes, it -- I always said this was my oderver to camp life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  Did Roosevelt’s death also represent great uncertainty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It did represent great uncertainty. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">There was uncertainty anyhow, about who would come next, and how would he handle it? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It just brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the nothinglessness, of the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">No <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , nowhere really to go, no profession, they couldn’t make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Just emptiness, all gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Were there cultural or religious activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I believe you already mentioned concerts, so there were some cultural activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">There were -- you had to be very careful what you did, because there were these great political differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And you very easy got into a fistfight or something of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So we tried- we tried to have lectures, but not about politics, if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Oh yes, we had the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">As we were supposedly strange animals, yeah, they sent us a psychiatrist from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , who was supposed to help people. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I think he may have been of European origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He certainly didn’t know how to handle people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And he asked questions you ask in your <span class="BUILDING">private office</span> , but they are do -- not applying to camp life. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But the administration was very proud, we had a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We were glad when he left, but --
QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Dreyfuss. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I think that’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Did you have much success in helping individuals find family members?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  We didn’t do too much of that in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There was another outfit what worked out of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , a location service, which matched thousands of families, but we didn’t do it, we didn’t know how to do it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And we really were extremely busy with keeping things under control. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">People went on hunger strike, it -- all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They fought with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">As I say, somebody died shoveling snow, and family thought the administration should never have allowed him to shovel snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And that’s the only one I remember, there may be other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And had organize that people were visitor in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They were always so busy, the men were not so busy, the men had a difficult time to take women’s jobs, like cleaning the <span class="INT_SPACE">barrack rooms</span> they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We had single men, and they had to take care of their shabby, little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  How would you characterize the political tensions that you referred to earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  They were old border tensions, between the Yugoslav and the Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And then there are always fights between the Poles, and the Germans, I mean [indecipherable] traditionally have a little fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was not really politics as such, it was just old enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">It was excited people who would use every little incident to get excited about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  Were people housed together with other individuals of the same nationality, or was it a mixed housing situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  I can’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I think they were [indecipherable] but I am not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I think there were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  And you were mentioning earlier about men having to take on roles that traditionally were carried out by women. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Were men and women essentially doing the same type of work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think the men helped in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , but so did the women, but I know we couldn’t get the men to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d like to add about your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , before we move on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  No, not really, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I forgot to say that during my time in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , I became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">That’s important because I wanted too much to be a citizen, to eventually go to Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  What was the process like in becoming a citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  You know, it’s all 60 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I had to bring a witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I was the only one to be naturalized, and funny enough, in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westminster</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , they hadn’t naturalized anybody, as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Anyhow, I hold number one certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And of course, I was afraid, I should know some American history, and I know I got questions, what makes a suggestion a bill, when it had to become a bill, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This is tape number two, side A. On the last tape, we were speaking about your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , and -- where you were working with refugees, and now perhaps you can tell me what you did after you finished your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  When I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , I had moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and I was waiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I went back to a job I had had before, and that’s the <span class="BUILDING">juvenile court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I was always interested in working with delinquent youngsters -- so- called delinquent. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And I worked for what’s called <span class="BUILDING">Youth House</span> for boys, and later for <span class="BUILDING">Youth House</span> for girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Again, as a psychiatric social worker, taking histories this time for the judge to have -- make decisions what to do with a youngster, send him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , go to placement, or whatever was indicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I had done that early in the game, I forgot which year. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I did it again when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , and that was by the middle of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And I did it until the end of "46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I had been in touch with the Joint a long time before. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Actually, ’'d known about it all my life, cause my family was very instrumental in it’s creation. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And the Joint was one of the agencies working in Europe after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">The other was UNRRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Those were the two main agencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Of course, every religion had it’s representation. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the UNRRA was p-part of it, were really the most constructive factors in rebuilding. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism, but having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Europe at that time was chaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going, practically not knowing who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The Joint and <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> [indecipherable] really established <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , with the help of the army, for various groups, eventually for all people. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There have been so many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and they were different in the different <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">You had the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , and you had the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I can’t remember if they had a <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , but they had three <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And em -- each <span class="REGION">zone</span> had it’s country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He was in charge of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I know that when I came over, I was first going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to be oriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I did not know when I left here where I would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I assumed it would be <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> because of the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">To my great surprise it was <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And my much bigger surprise came, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few weeks in a sort of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">reception camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genechita</span> , City of the Movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It was the Hollywood of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Every nation, and wi -- religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Men, women, children. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I don’t know how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">To me it seemed thousands, it may not have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I remember as a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">If you ask me who administered it, I do not know any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I know it had no individual <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">There were partitions between the families, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the neighboring <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It may be part because it was my first real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I was absolutely overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The second day I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">If that was so or not, I have no idea, but everybody talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">That was, in my memory, the most primitive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but as I say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">In a way it was good, because every other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> seemed like -- not <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> , but at least not like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And I must say, I don’t remember anything of the beauty of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , which I had not seen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I only remember this miles of humanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And -- and then I was told I was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , because I had experience with hospital work, and [indecipherable] work. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And I got on long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It still was right after the war, and people always forget, your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> weren’t running. </span><span class="sentence" id="553"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> itself had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">The people were under the impression still of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Yes, they had won the war, oh, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> didn’t here -- take it back, I’m not sure <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> won. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But they were -- everything was gray and gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And it took us very, very long to get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , which usually takes a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Sleeping [indecipherable] didn’t work, it was -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was just a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in which a war had raged. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And one shouldn’t forget, it wasn’t only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You were hungry, and tired, and had no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">When I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , this <span class="BUILDING">rehabilitation center</span> , being a former <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , looked like absolute luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I did not stay in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I think that had had reasons, because it was tuberculosis all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We had, as far as I remember, no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Some younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20’s, from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , who had survived with her parents, and they had gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and died, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And that -- it’s really difficult to talk about, because it’s a double experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Here you had survivors faced with death again. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Now, what that meant to them, I can’t imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my fingertips. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the Hungarians and the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Being angry at the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">This is [indecipherable] people. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I remember three of young men who were not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30’s and 40’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">You hadn’t many old people survive, and you hadn’t many children survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Not in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We had a doctor from <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , who was the M.D. director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we had Displaced Persons physicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">We had about three physicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Now, either ask me how many patients, I really don’t know, about a hundred, could be mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Too long ago to ve -- to remember figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And, what perhaps has to be mentioned 1s that was the time where streptomycin was a rarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was a much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Also, for the TB doctors, they had to stand very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">This is procedure, and I know once or twice somebody fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And streptomycin, we always had to get on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Now, this was the center of the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And the accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And -- and the other thing was, there was something -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> , with a very low prices. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There are also two currencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other called? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">A script. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I don’t remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar, from two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And there was a fight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And all these things are of course, forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don’t know how many, have been in articles I have written over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They are not very new. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I’ve told them before. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But one can’t duplicate them, I can’t invent new ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And one which shows you the difficulty with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Jewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And these were the first holidays in freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So, my people in the -- I call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it’s really abcenter, wanted to be like <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and have geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all I had was the canned goods the Joint hand me? </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Now, many, many of my people weren’t even used to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP’s would be able to look after live chicken and geese, and there was somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So then I went to the mayor of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Well, they let me have some. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So, in our <span class="BUILDING">DP Center</span> , we had guk, guk, guk, guk. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And they were a big excitement, we had them for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We had to feed them, they were like everybody else, starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And the whole group, of course, was very much interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And Rosh Hashanah came. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he was cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you know what a mushkia is? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster, came in, and he looked at it and said, “Trayfa, no good, no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">You can’t eat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Now tell your community what happened.” </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I said, “We m -- have to find a way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">This means life to them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and the un-Orthodox want to go what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Now, the un-Orthodox said, “We can eat -- eat it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The Orthodox says, “Trayfa, trayfa, it can’t be done.” </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Then the Orthodox committee came to me and said, “You know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi.” </span><span class="sentence" id="626">A-Again this gentleman assimilated [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Now, try to phone, in <span class="REGION">occupied Germany</span> after the war from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I had to call General Clay’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , who was the commander of all of the <span class="REGION">German zones</span> , and I got some soldier who thought I was utterly nuts. “</span><span class="sentence" id="630">What do you want, chicken? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Buy some chicken.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="632">Excuse me, I have to,” -- “All right, you get clearance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I get clearance, I call for the wonder rabbi, and I get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And he says, “First of all, are you a Jewish daughter? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Well, this is a very difficult question, I have to think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Would you call back in two hour?” </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I said, “But the things have to be cooked. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I have no time to waste, I have excited people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Call back. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So I go through the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , who just -- who just shakes his head, I am sure, but gives me clearance. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And then I get the answer, it’s a little difficult to translate from the German Jewish. “</span><span class="sentence" id="642">If the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was higher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of the faucet, then they can be eaten.” </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So I was on very good terms with a young <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> director, who had had a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I said to him, “Please, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from the faucet?” </span><span class="sentence" id="645">He knew exactly what I was doing, said, “Yes, Miss Tarenberg, I did.” </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I went back, called my two committees together, and said, “That’s the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi, we can’t go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals.” </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But these stories, once in a lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Bad food is 1n all institutions, one of the main cause for trouble, because people don’t have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their anxiety, on food. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And I have had so many debates about food, you can’t imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">In the three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> I worked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with the families, some were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , if they were alive, was really unforgettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">On a more cheerful note, we had our first wedding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And that again 1s a story, how overly sensitive people are under those conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know what it is? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">To <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a wedding dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for cottons, and out of the cotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And in a actual over-identification, I made myself a dress, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We must have looked like a <span class="DLF">flower garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Anyhow, when they married, I wanted to give them a wedding present. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">You don’t have very much to give, and anyhow, money seemed to be the most important. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Well, I took some lira and put them in an envelope, which was from my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And much later came to me and said, “I didn’t thank you, because I was annoyed, because you didn’t take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something nice on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we’ll give it to Aliyah beth.” </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I said, “You’re welcome, if that gives you satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I surely didn’t want to hurt you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But that’s typical for the over-sensitivity. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">That was a Greek girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saronica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I found them a particularly sensitive group. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don’t know as much as [indecipherable] that I know about the other <span class="REGION">European countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But they are a very sensitive group to work with. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We had quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> somewhere, who turned out not to be Jewish at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">As I say, the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn’t do more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , this at least meant some security, but that they didn’t know to which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">She had waited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but he was married to another woman, he had thought she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And -- help. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And then, a young lady who really -- later in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , when I met her, by chance in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , became a friend of mine, had marched all the way from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , that was days and nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And she was young, she was almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one brother who had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she’ II come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Had bad case of TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They all had TB, but this was one of the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And I looked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">You do what you think has to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It’s not always social work, what’s [indecipherable] happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And one day we got a cable from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that her brother had died in the war against <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Now I had the nice job to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even today, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Many didn’t talk about their past, but she felt she want to describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span> , and there were many children. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It was a very religious home. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And then I left, and I didn’t hear about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I thought of her sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I had a picture, with a very nice dedication. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And really, 40 years went by, and I -- I’m here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> in a <span class="DLF">street</span> , in front of a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , looking at some hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And a very tiny voice behind me said, “Aren’t you Miss Tarenberg?” </span><span class="sentence" id="700">That was Celie, that’s her name, Celia. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And she had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , had gotten TB again, was in a <span class="BUILDING">TB sanitarium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Had married, happily. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Her husband died. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Had married again, living quite near here. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Has two wonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I’d never thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Had [indecipherable] in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We see each other once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It’s gone -- I never [indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">You find that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , people became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It’s very difficult to say something to either. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But I found that over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And it’s interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , were quite different than what you get today. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I remember, I think out of my personal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were very religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">You don’t hear that any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  How were you able to communicate with people from so many different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  With my broken Yiddish, and German, and to other member, we talk English. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">English was taught in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and so when you had people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who went to a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you sometimes could. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I do not remember communications difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">In what we said, yes, but not language-wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Did you start learning other languages yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I can make myself understood in -- 1n -- in Italian, or in Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">In Europe you pick up languages from traveling, but I don’t speak that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  So I just want to establish the setting of this experience, not necessarily at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but more like a <span class="BUILDING">rehabilitation center</span> , as you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Was it wintertime? </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And exactly when did you arrive there, or as best as you can recall, month and year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  I think in the mer -- no, that I can -- I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> , I arrived in the spring of ’47.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  You talked about the individuals there having tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Did you see many deaths? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Were many of them very ill?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  I -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> , I saw quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">They are -- were all ready for rehabilitation, so you didn’t see too many -- they were not -- it’s not true, they were not already for rehab. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We see -- so I saw several deaths in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I cannot remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Now, were you paid for doing this kind of work, as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I was paid by the Joint Distribution Committee, and I was paid, actually in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because of all the difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">We got a certain amount of script, I believe, in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and found quite a bit of money after three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">We weren't rich, but --
QUESTION:  Did you sign up for a certain time period to work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Not on a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a contract was usually for 18 months, but you could break it any time, if you had to, and people did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  Did you have any other friends, or acquaintances in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , going to do this same kind of work in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">ANSWER:  I had two friends who did -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , we were talking about people you knew, who also went to do relief work, and work with refugees in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  Yeah, I know these two, and I met other people in Europe with whom I still am friends, colleagues of mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  What was the journey like to get to Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Any specific recollections of that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I don’t even remember if I came -- probably by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , I don’t remember anythi -- yes, yeah, I came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , but I really don’t remember anything whatsoever about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  I think you already made some kind of reference to the kinds of discussions that you had with refugees, and whether or not they wanted to talk about their past. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Did they more often want to talk about the war time experiences in comparison to their past before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  That is difficult to say, because is a highly individual -- some people had a great need to talk about their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and to show that they had little a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , or a good business, or -- and I think people react in accordance with their personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">You can’t really make generalizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Some people had a great need to show how clever they had been in surviving, while today we recognize that survivor, was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">There are some things that have been shown, which made survivor, for instance, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , somewhat more likely, if you had a close relative somewhere who needed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">If you had a reason to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">There are such things that one can perhaps a little, generalize. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">There was much more things that had to be hidden at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I remember one man was so upset because he had stolen potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And well, there were much more serious crimes that had been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could have saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I always have difficulty with some of the things, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these stories, I don’t even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I know it, but that’s my quarrel I have very often, with people I discuss this whole -- memories are memories, but they are not documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They change. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Human mind is stra -- is really doing strange things. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And people who’ve changed their story don’t even know that they have changed it. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="769">ve had people tell me another person’s story, and thought it was theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So, what I always say, but that’s now a personal opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Your facts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories [indecipherable] are really the flesh you put on the skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Cause it’s amazing what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And then there are, of course, people who do it with a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">One experience is that when we were very eager to get people to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and they were -- the doctors felt they were really ready to go, but their x-rays didn’t show it, we thought of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And the same people, when it came to restitution in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , wanted me to testify that they had tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">That’s very difficult to decide what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Were there any instances where you knew that it was wrong to do something, but you knew that it -- in the end it would help someone, so you did it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  I think I’m not going to answer that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  Do you feel that your own memories have changed much over these years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  It has changed by getting old. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I ha -- the facts are not changed, but many things I could remember even two years ago, aS you see me groping for words sometimes, that’s the process of aging. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I don’t think that the facts of any of the things I say, aren’t true. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I can’t guarantee, but I don’t think it 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  In the conversations you had with refugees, did they talk much about their goals for the future?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And it wasn’t as fashionable as now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Now you have tourists arrangements to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">There wasn’t my job.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">ANSWER:  No, I wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I wouldn’t see any reason why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I know enough about it, I wouldn’t make anything better by seeing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I haven’t even been to our <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here, at the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I would have gone to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , if I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I would go e- eventually to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They got my first forgers by that time, I didn’t really have any contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">So they wrote, and I sent them, and I was sorry later, but [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  The refugees who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the ones you worked with, were they primarily from certain <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">ANSWER:  You mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bashkimine</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Yes, the majority was from <span class="REGION">east Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I can remember -- oh, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , there’s quite a few from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Not from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , interesting enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">QUESTION:  How did these refugees feel about being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  Well, they wanted to get out of it, but again, and you can’t underestimate the self- centeredness people had to have to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- one hated <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and you hope [indecipherable] what happen, and so on, but your main interest was to get out, and to make money, and to get well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">There were -- in the three <span class="NPIP">places</span> , there were some political fanatics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Some against Roosevelt, others were against <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , others were -- hated <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">But they made a lot of [indecipherable] noise, no other action that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">But of course, there may have been things they wouldn’t have shared with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">QUESTION:  What sort of advice did you offer to refugees in any of the counseling sessions that you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1214">ANSWER:  Let me pin it very much on the problem they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">If it was a family problem, which it often was, you did the usual counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I -- a thing I advised all of them to get into some working process, be it in someplace it could help in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And in other, we had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , in some are -- in other, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bashkimine</span> , there was a big wi -- camp, very close, where they had very good causes, so we encouraged them to go down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And otherwise it was the usual counseling, where do you -- how do you come to der -- terms with things you don’t come to terms with? </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">What ways of adjustment? </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Give them opportunity to talk about their childhood, about their escape, trying to set their mind at ease about whatever they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Listen to the good things they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Trying to build up the personality as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And also trying to get some sort of community council getting started [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Really, pretty much what a social worker is supposed to do, but I did it as a sideline, the main things were always what the day brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Not enough sheets on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , or not enough peninsilino, streptomycins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Could they get coffee, or decaf, or -- at remember that I organized any trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Also, trying to get the doctors, to -- who were medically trained, but not psychologically, to understand the patient better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">QUESTION:  Do you feel that your own training as a social worker prepared you for these roles that you had to fulfill?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">ANSWER:  Prepare? </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">My training helped me to find my personality, and to use it constructively, and that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">But the actual causes, it didn’t do me any harm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">It’s -- it’s hard to say what you bring to the training, and what the training gives to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">It gives you discipline, which I had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">It made me understand American life better, and the social system, which 1s very, very different from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I certainly knew more about welfare and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And the mixture of being European and having American training helped me, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">QUESTION:  Were the living conditions pretty similar in the two centers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where you worked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  From the DP’s, or from me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">QUESTION:  Well, mostly for the DP’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">ANSWER:  Yes, they were very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I think Merrano, because it was beautifully located, and had more appealing <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , was I think, the more cheerful setting, if a <span class="BUILDING">TB sanitorium</span> can be cheerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number three, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Would you continue to tell me about differences, and similarities between the different centers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">The two in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you got to know, and if you’d like to compare with the one in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">ANSWER:  Comparisons are always difficult, no matter what you compare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">The thing that stands out in my mind 1s that the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> were closer to their real survivor experiences, and were more revolutionary, and also had more of a feeling of quote, that’s coming to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And they really felt that the world owed them a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Certainly <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because it was so rich, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because it had handled them so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">As far as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they were both located in pleasant surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">I think the kooven ital -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had more contact with the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> , than the group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> had with the inhabitants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">The problems were pretty much the same, health, where to go to, how to handle one’s past, and what the future will bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">This is an oversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">What is very much on my mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my <span class="BUILDING">rehab center</span> population, are in their late 50’s, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of aging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">From my work with survivors in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I have seen that they pretty much go to a second -- through a second immigration when they get older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Certainly the language that they have handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I find that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they haven’t done for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Also, of course, living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where you haven’t gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Loneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do you survive for? </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, no neighbors that know the <span class="DLF">streets</span> they have walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And if it comes to memories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the survivor escape to? </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">So, I think -- and I know that at the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Yes, the experience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Everything gets overly intensified.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">QUESTION:  Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work, after returning from Europe, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1268">ANSWER:  I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And I have had an -- when I still had cases -- later I became an administrator, I have had cases of people who were older, and my agency had a <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> once a week, for older survivors, and that always gave me a chance to talk to different people, and as I’m, in a way, one of them, they share it with me quite frankly, their pleasures, and their worries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And, of course, sickness 1s another one, where people born and raised in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , may have a relative come in, or a long time friend when they need help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">It’s always very different -- difficult for the survivor who lives alone, to find a person who helps take care of their bookkeeping, whom they can have on their living will, and all these documents that run all our lives, become problems, and make it suddenly clear again, yes you thought you were an American, you thought you were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here, and suddenly you feel like a foreigner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">QUESTION:  Id like to return to your time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and to your own living conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">ANSWER:  Okay, which --
QUESTION:  So when you were in either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birishgamine</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> , what were the living conditions that you had on a weekly basis, a daily basis, how can you give some picture of what your own conditions were like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">ANSWER:  We were so much daily living that they almost are not conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">I had <span class="BUILDING">office</span> hours from about 10 to about four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">People came to me when they had question about their pocket money, when their laundry wasn’t intact, or the cook was angry, somebody had sent the food back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">So I think part of the time, I was made of all purposes, and then people had sometimes gotten letters from consulates in a different language, which I tried to translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">They had to make official phone calls, which I made for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And almost always, they took this opportunity to talk about what just worried them that particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">They hadn’t heard from an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> who was supposed to give an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">The <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> hasn’t let them know somebody had treated them badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">There was a rumor that <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> had -- took only people in agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Whatever came up during the day, and then in the evening sometimes, we really talked about olden times, how it was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , how they had sat around the open fire, how the grandfather had lived with them, how different it all was when the Russians came, who came riding into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and had very different ideas of civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Also, on the other hand, had been very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Many had been liberated by the Russians, who had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and had really only good things to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Other had stories that they simply had to tell, because they’ve had such an injustice had to be done to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">I remember a little story which is indicative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">In a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there were a husband and wife, and as most <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , as -- especially <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , there was absolutely nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And one day, the husband had managed to gather two potatoes to bring to his wife, who was in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And it was a very wet, damp day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">He tried to balance his way on <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> -- bare feet through the ward with his two potatoes, and he was very close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when an SS man came and just threw the potatoes out of his hand, down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> , so that they couldn’t be eaten any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And he said, “That was one time where I cried.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And I must confess, I cried when I heard the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  How do you look back on the emotional reaction in you, during your time working with refugees, and how -- you say you cried from this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">What other incidents really got to your center, and bothered you, disturbed you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  The interesting thing 1s, the big stories don’t upset you as much as the small ones, and the reason 1s, I cannot identify with thousand people being killed, but I can identify with a husband being proud to relieve the starving of his wife, and have it spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And I’ve always felt, when I’m honest, it is these small things, the things that could have happened to me, in my experience, because the other things I haven’t experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I have not lost somebody in a fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I haven’t lost anybody through Hitler, really, but I’ve lost a much -- many other things, and I know the loss were innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Things I have experienced are easier to ad -- identify with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">There are some stories of escapes through snow nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Now, I have some there from my husband, but as you will read them, why should I tell them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">That -- his life was full of these small stories that get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And not only me, but everybody we knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1306">QUESTION:  Did you feel that there was an emotional toll, or price that you had to pay to do this kind of work with refugees? </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">At the end of a day, did you reflect to yourself, and try to -- try to come up with ways to look at each day with perspective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">ANSWER:  Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if there’s something I could have done better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And when I found something, I welcome it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">An emotional toll, perhaps it didn’t take, because I felt guilty to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And everything that I could do, would relieve my personal feeling of guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I came out of it, I think a better social worker, or to b -- say it better, a better listener, because so much of the help one could give, was simply by listening with a sensitive ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">You may say a trained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that nobody wanted to listen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And they were bitter about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And even today, the first thing one’s being told, oh well, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , nobody wanted to hear us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1316">QUESTION:  Did you keep a journal, or in any other way record your reflections?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">ANSWER:  I didn’t keep a journal, but when something really moved me, I made either a story out of it, because I liked to write, or put 1t down verbatim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I kept those notes for a long time, but I don’t have them any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Again, with respect to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> , or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> where you were working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , were there similar types of religious activities and observances, as what you saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> , and also, what could you say about any of the cultural activities taking place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or centers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I don’t remember that we celebrated a Jewish holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I may not have been there during holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">I don’t remember the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we definitely had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">You may have had several [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barishkamine</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">QUESTION:  Do you have more distinct memories of Merrano, in comparison to the two in -- places in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I think because it was the first, and I came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed in touch with some instructors who went later to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And the young girl I mentioned to you as the youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> together, and then married a doctor, and came here, and stayed with me for some time, and I helped her find a job here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">Yes, Merrano has many more memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">The others, I never feeled at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and it was somehow -- it was more of a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1331">QUESTION:  And what time period were you, more or less, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> working with refugees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1332">ANSWER:  From ’49. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">I think part of °48, the end of ’48. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">In ’50, I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1335">QUESTION:  In any of these situations, whether in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , did you encounter any families that were intact, any family members that had already found each other again, or was it all single individuals, even if there were marriages within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> or the centers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1336">ANSWER:  I think there were families in [indecipherable] in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where I was a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">I cannot remember -- I think husband and wife, I may have met one or two couples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1338">QUESTION:  And in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , were there marriages in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> or centers, just as there were in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1339">ANSWER:  Made a mistake, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> there weren’t, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">QUESTION:  Maybe I made the mistake, but . . .[ </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">may have also gotten the wrong impression about something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">I think I was told that in one of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you were the only relief worker living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">ANSWER:  These were <span class="BUILDING">rehab centers</span> , and they were -- they were listed as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , so I use it sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I think everywhere I was -- no, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barishkamine</span> , I think I was the only one living there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">QUESTION:  And was that a choice on your part, something that you asked for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">ANSWER:  I think I was the only worker, and it was [indecipherable] it was the thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">QUESTION:  So, in other words, when you were working with refugees, you were living amongst them, or
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">QUESTION:  And then you would go on the weekends, or at some other point to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , is that how your routine went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1349">ANSWER:  There was never a set routine, but very often I would do that, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1350">QUESTION:  And again, just like I was asking with respect to the refugees 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> you worked with, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , did many of them wind up leaving the centers while you were there, and how did the conditions change from the point when you started, to the point when you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1351">ANSWER:  Basically they didn’t change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Some people left, their visa came through, sometimes they found a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The big change was, there was a <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> one could go to, by -- or rather <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> one could go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354"><span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> you needed the English permit, and didn’t get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">So that opened up new hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful toward the end of my work, than in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">QUESTION:  When you would take down the histories of refugees experiences, on a daily basis, were you surprised and shocked from -- with what you heard, or did you go through a sort of transformation during your time with this work, and --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Even today, and I have taken hundreds here too, I think every history is different, and it will get me, I sometimes get mad at the client in my mind, and sometimes I admire them, but I’ve never gotten to the point where they don’t touch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">They may not -- I’m sure they don’t touch me as much as they did in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">But I was very prepared for my husband’s stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">But that came out a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">No, I -- I never really got tired or blasé about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1362">QUESTION:  And yet, weren’t you often surprised? </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Was every day bringing something new to your awareness that you had not heard before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">ANSWER:  Not every day, but once in awhile, I did hear about a criminal act I’d never heard of before, or some event I had never heard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And that overwhelmed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">There was one mention, at one point, which I can’t document, of somebody who claimed to have eaten human flesh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">That was something I could neither understand, nor digest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I’ve never heard it again, other people said it was never [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">QUESTION:  Did refugees talk much about war crimes trials taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">I don’t know which ca -- which year the war crimes took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1374">QUESTION:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , did the refugees often talk about specific perpetrators, and --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">They talked a great deal about the kapos, the people who were the supervisors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And they had grim stories to tell, and they would repeat the stories over and over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1377">QUESTION:  But you also heard about people who had done good things, and they remembered that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Polish peasants who had survi -- had helped survive a couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">Some had survived, a couple -- had saved a couple’s child, and some person said, “None of us would have survived, if it wouldn’t have been for people who were helpful.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">I heard that from both Italian -- more Italians than Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">But also <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but less so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1382">QUESTION:  Did you meet individuals from your own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1383">ANSWER:  Once or twice, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1384">QUESTION:  People you had known?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1385">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1386">QUESTION:  So will you tell me now how it came to pass that you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and eventually returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1387">ANSWER:  Well, I guess my contract was up, and three years was long enough, and I had met my future husband at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And the eventually hope was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And I -- I just had had -- I -- I felt it was time to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">I had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> I wasn’t -- didn’t know what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">So I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">And [indecipherable] immigration agencies, for HIAS -- for New York Association for New Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">Then, for a short time, I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">juvenile court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And then I heard that my latest agency, 1959 -- in the meantime I got married -- Self Help, was looking for somebody to take over for vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">And I said Il do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">I came for three months, and stayed 40 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">And I worked as a caseworker first, psychiatric social worker, and eventually ended up as deputy director. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">That was an agency that worked exclusively for survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">It started with survivors from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but soon became survivors from <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1400">QUESTION:  So you want to continue telling me about this organization you worked for, Self Help?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1401">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">It was founded in 1935 by German refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And they founded it, and worked together with the Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">So, in name, it is always a non-sectarian agency, but today it works only for Jewish survivors -- that is not true, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Anyh -- it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">It still has a section only for SUIVIVOTS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1407">QUESTION:  Did you get involved with restitution issues?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">ANSWER:  As an agency, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">We worked closely with claims conference, and the president of the claims conference was a board member of our agency, w-we worked very closely with all agencies, as another German Jewish agency, the blue card --
QUESTION:  You’ve made references to the fact that you later met many of the survivors and refugees you had helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And how did those meetings usually come about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Did you take initiative to try to contact them --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1412">QUESTION:  -- or did they come to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1413">ANSWER:  No, neither nor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">Just by chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">Self Help has a great home health aide service, and people ask for our home health aides, and they were often survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And Self Help, together with other agencies, runs quite a few <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , which were originally for survivors, so I met survivors there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">Then United Helpers, this the agency has a scholarship program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">I met them for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And yet, there’s also a German Jewish based <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">By now I meet quite a few there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1421">QUESTION:  What can you say about the similarities, and differences between the different organizations you’ve worked for through the years, that have helped refugees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1422">ANSWER:  HIAS is an immigration agency founded by Jewish people from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , and has many of it’s connections in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">The American Joint was founded by German Jews, and it’s connections are more in <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Both agencies are immigration agencies, both work in many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe, have many similarities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">There’s <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Basically, they have the same goal, I think -- it’s hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I really w-would have to read the formulation of their missions to be able -- I know what the working differences is, but what’s in their mission, I couldn’t say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And then we have the Jewish Federation, which funnels all these agencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">You have a small, but very effective German Jewish agency called the Blue card, which 1s a relief giving agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">The other agencies, basically, are not giving relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">They help with everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And the Council of Jewish Women, I think doesn’t do anything, they used to help with immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And Self Help has become rowt -- right now, an all around agency, that has a -- a very large homemaker service, with almost 3,000 homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">No, not 3,000, over a thousand homemakers, and it has five <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> that it runs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">It does five <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen centers</span> , for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">And in our <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , too, there weren’t enough immigrants any more, so it’s open now to Chinese, and everywhere, who is living in that particular community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1437">QUESTION:  I know that you mentioned this briefly earlier, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on something you mentioned in the way of survivors who you met first in DP situations in Europe --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1438">QUESTION:  -- showing a certain perspective about their experiences, and that over the years, in meeting them again, were meeting other refugees again, or for the first time even, that you’ve seen a different kind of perspective shared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1439">ANSWER:  That applies mostly to the way things are remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27", 2000, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">This is tape number four, side A.
ANSWER:  In comparison, the more sheltered time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> is, in their memories, more positive than it was when they lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">There, the old insecurity and fear was overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">Now that the struggle in the outside world has been not easy, to say the least, the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> is seen in rosier and rosier light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">I have a friend who is writing a book, who I sometimes talk to, and he asked me to give him some names of people who would give him their -- their history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">And I suggested them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And he said it was very difficult to get anything negative for them, they were only ready to paint it in the most positive pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">That, of course, is rather interesting, and my only explanation is that life on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was strenuous, and makes the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> experience, sheltered life, not to worry about job, not to raise children, in rosier light than it really was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1448">QUESTION:  What do you say is the long term impact on your own perspective, of having spent so many years of your life working with refugees and survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1449">ANSWER:  I think for me it was a natural thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">I have never had any doubt about going into it, and I must say, coming out of it, I find in a way this history is a logical ending to about 40 years of service, which I have given with pleasure, also with heartache, but that’s part of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">QUESTION:  I believe that recently you donated a few items to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">Could you briefly tell me about those items?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1453">ANSWER:  Yeah, the one, and I think the most interesting one was a passport issued by Raoul Wallenberg, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">It was given to my husband, and I happen to have the original, and I sent it to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I also sent them a picture of the <span class="BUILDING">sanitortum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span> , and one has the director on it, the other our first group of graduating nurse’s aides. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">I also sent them most recently, a large snapshot of Goering, which was taken by my brother, who was asked to interrogate Goering in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">That picture came into my hand, and I thought it has a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1458">QUESTION:  And today you just showed me an item that Ill be sending on the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1459">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1460">QUESTION:  You could explain that, perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1461">ANSWER:  I really don’t quite know how it came into my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">I think it was really given to me by a friend who had found it at a book fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">It’s certainly not a historically reliable document, because it’s strongly politically influenced, but it 1s interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1464">QUESTION:  Would you just explain it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">What is the actual item, just so we have on tape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1466">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">This is a paper booklet listing all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in greater Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">They have ever listed some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which I am not even sure that they were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and they broke it down to great <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1469">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1470">ANSWER:  I would very much hope that some research will be done to the psychological adjustment of the aging survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">For instance, the influence of the history married marriages -- marriage -- that will be edited out -- which had a tendency to get very difficult at the point of retirement, when the couple, for the first time, really got to know each other, because they had the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">I’ve seen that, and I very -- I have many case histories for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Somebody should really explore that a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And the influence of course, of the generation differences, which is much stronger if you live in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which were -- you were not born, and where the morals, from beginning, are different from the ones you were raised with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I think I’ve said it, another point of that history, this is one phase of the survivor story which has not yet been fully explored, the aging ofa survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">None of us has as yet survived aging.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">QUESTION:  Thank you very much for being interviewed today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">It’s been a --
ANSWER:  Thank you for taking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">I really enjoyed it, and I’m very pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">For me, this is a very positive ending to something I have given much of my life to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">Thank you.</span></p>
