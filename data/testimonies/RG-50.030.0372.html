<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Well we find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We knew about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So we find places in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where they used to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They had like <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , you know <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So one day before we find out, when my boyfriend went to work, they took like seven or eight people and they didn't come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">They run away to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But there was far away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno ghetto</span> was far away, it's not like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashoshok</span> (ph), so they run away, they didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So we knew already that it's time. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So I find out, a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , and I went with my father, and some of them, they didn't let us go in because they had plenty people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So I said, you must let me. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">If I'm going to get killed, you're going to get killed too. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So they had no choice, we was one and another, a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , how big it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So this was one night, then it was a week later, again, the Huguenot, they came, and they had to give them the people, how many they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And this was going on for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So one time, we didn't go to the same <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">One time I find out another <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they hiding, so I said to my father, we're not going to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it's like I felt like it's no good to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I said, "we're going to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> ". </span><span class="sentence" id="449">He said to me, "what is the difference, what makes a difference, a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> is a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> to hide someplace". </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So we went, sure enough, everybody got killed in this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  Well they thought that they were going to be alive, they were going to let them leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So whenever they had to take the people, you know, the people used to cry, nobody wants to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We knew already that they take them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , not like here, they kill them, you know, right away in the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They took them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But they didn't help, they wasn't so good either. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Well they was fighting for their own lives, but they were wrong, they kept them till they need them. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">What they don't need they kill, they killed everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So then there came to a point when we was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , it was one morning, I was still sleeping, and my father went out, he used to get up early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">He came back, and I heard already the shots, already. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">He said to me, "my daughter", he said, "my child, get dressed, they killing already, on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , they don't take like, you know, like they used to take, they're killing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ". </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Get dressed, that's it, this was the last word for him, and when I saw him, I never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He went out through the <span class="DLF">door</span> , that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I got dressed and I went out, and I heard people out screaming, and the shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So I figured, where shall I go, where to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Before the war, it was a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> like near there, and they used to keep bread, bread and bagels, all kinds of things in a big box, like a very big box, like this, a big box. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So I saw the box and I figured, I'm going to go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I went in without anything, it was cold already, it was winter, fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But in Europe comes winter very hard, it's not like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And there is fall and winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Here is winter, summer, there 1s no fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So I went in without, just in a dress, without anything, and I was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I didn't know what to do, my brains didn't work already. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Where was my father, I didn't see him, nobody's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I heard all those screams and cry, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">This was in the day time in the morning and this was going until it got a little dark, it got darker, it's came the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And it was already quiet, so I figured, everybody got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">What I'm going to do there? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">What I'm going to do, without food, without clothes, where to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I'm afraid to go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I'm afraid to walk, they're going to kill me like everybody they killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And it was so quiet, and I don't know where to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is not familiar to me, it's not like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashoshok</span> (ph) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radun</span> , where I grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It's everything 1s to me like, I don't know nobody and I don't know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But then it was start to be already the day time, I was there a whole day and a whole night sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I heard like somebody's crying, so I figure, I have to get up, go out anyway sometimes, I can't stay here all the time, till I die there? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So I went out and I saw one woman and I said to ask, "from where are you coming"? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">She said, everybody got killed, nobody's there. "</span><span class="sentence" id="502">What are you doing here"? "</span><span class="sentence" id="503">I don't know myself", she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I said, "you saw somebody, some Jews"? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">She said, "they're in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I saw a few people, they're still alive". </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I went there and I met the people, I met a few there, a brother and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I don't remember already, there was a brother and a sister, and another couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So I went to them and they said, "When it's going to get dark, very dark at night, we're going to go in", this was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , "we're going to go in <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Livendore</span> (ph), we were going to get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So I got dressed there, I didn't have nothing, without clothes, without shoes, without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I wore boots I find there, you know, what the people that are not there already, with a coat, with a pocketbook. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And I got dressed and they got dressed and we was waiting till 1t get dark, and as soon it get dark, we was through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , going 1n couples, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">To go through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , to go outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and to reach where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">To go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So as soon, I think I got the third or the fourth, I don't remember exactly, and right away I got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I got caught, he was a policeman working for the Germans, a Pollack, a Polish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And he said, "I have to take you to the gestapo". </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I said, "why, why you have to take me? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They should kill me, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">What you going to have from this? </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Listen, I don't have nothing, just this what I have on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I have the coat and I have the boots, and that's all what I got". </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I said, "no money, no clothes, no nothing". </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I'm going to leave", I said, "you know what's going on, maybe you did the same thing to them, but what you going to have for this? </span><span class="sentence" id="524">If they're going to kill me, you going to have on your mind your whole life because you personally took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">When they took all of them, it's different than when you're taking one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I am still so young, what can I give you. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">If you want I can take off my boots to give you, my coat, and let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Let me live, let me go, think about this". </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So I don't know, maybe, and I spoke rather nice Polish, and maybe he realized, I don't know, he had a pity on me, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don't know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And Polish he said to me, " ". </span><span class="sentence" id="532">This means, run away.

<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  Did they get killed right there or were they taken to the gestapo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  I don't know because I can't tell you because I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I think not, they didn't got killed right away because I knew for myself because he wanted to take me, he didn't kill me right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He wanted to take me to the gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So I figure that somebody took them too, to the gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They didn't kill them right away, on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And then I was going and thinking to myself, what to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">God, where shall I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="561">What to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="562">If to go to a Pollack, some on the way where I walk, they were going to kill me right away because there was bad people. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I didn't sleep, I was tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I was hungry, I wanted to have a little bit water. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Where to go, what to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I was thinking that where I was going, and this time I saw how far away I was, with a slight, because there was snow already, it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And there was going by the both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , two people, three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So I was thinking, this can't be the Germans, this 1s all the Pollacks, probably the Pollacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But I had no choice, I had to go, I had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I see they coming to me, they coming, they coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So I took more the kerchief around my head and then they was so near to me, they stopped, and they stopped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And they asking me, they couldn't think that this was a Jewish girl, they thought maybe it's a Polish going from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the other one, to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And they said in Polish, they asking me "where are you going"? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So the other man came over and he said to me, called me my name. "</span><span class="sentence" id="575">You're alive, you going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno ghetto</span> "? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So I said, "yes". </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They was going, they are the partisans, they had a rifle with them, they had two, in fact they had two rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And they were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to take out one person, they was going to take out his mother and the sister.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  I couldn't have the letters by me, so she used to write in the <span class="BUILDING">postal center</span> , they used to call, if you're familiar with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">So I used to come in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> and I used to take out a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I was afraid to read there in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I used to go around where I didn't see people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And I used to read and cry a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And I used to tear it in little, little pieces, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And I couldn't answer her, I was afraid because they can come at night and take me out, that's all, take away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">You know, before Stalin died, he had a plan to take out all the Jews, to take them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and to freeze them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Not to kill them like the Germans did, but he would freeze them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Because there it's so cold that you can't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And he would keep us in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this where there's no eat, no nothing, and he would kill all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So I was all the time, you know, my daughter was born in 1950 and this was in 1953 before he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So he had this plan and they had to start already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And we didn't know what to do, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">It was worse, but like this we had a good life, but we had no future and we was afraid for tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">So when he died he didn't have too much time because he died in 1953 and there was, then was other people took over and the other people was very good, very good to everybody, and we had a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Till then I start to write letters to my sister, and she start to write to me, to answer me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">But to go out it was out of the question, we couldn't go out never, never in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">But then when they changed, when came the other people in Stalin's place, so they letted out the Polish people to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">This way we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I wrote already my sister, she knew already that I'm there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I called her, I made a call on her telephone, you know, she should pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And then she start to take us from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">But after a little while she find out that she can't take us all, it has to be one person and this is going to take a long, long time until we're going to get the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So I said to her, and that time they said, "whoever wants to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> can go free". </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">So I said to my husband, "whether it's going <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> or it's going a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , we are going, we are not staying here in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with the Polish people". </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And this what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So I didn't wait for my sister till she was going to do everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , at least I'm safe there, I have got a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">It was a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">It was after a war, we had seen, it was a war, it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Everything was like you had to get, like for food, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">It was hard to get to work, everything was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Anyway my sister helped me, she send me money, she send me packages, and she helped me a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Till she's this was in '57 when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , 1957. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So it was till 1959, till my sister made out the papers for us, for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">In the beginning she could only take one person, me with my daughter or my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I didn't want to leave my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Or he didn't want to leave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So I said to her, I was that we're not going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">If to go, to come to you, only all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Otherwise we're going to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Now is a bad time but we're going to get through this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">We had hard times a lot in our lives, we get through this too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">But the only thing, that we are free, we are with Jews, I'm not afraid that they're going to kill me, that I'm a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Everybody's there, the Jews, but the Arabs, nobody was afraid for the Arabs there, that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Even now, they're not afraid for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Whatever's going to happen's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">But it's our <span class="REGION">land</span> , it's our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it's our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And the biggest mistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Maybe God punished me for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">What I went through here, a lot of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And there maybe I would avoid everything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I left because I wasn't afraid that 1t was a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">My husband went to work, and he work, he could work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He went, he never had this, he never worked on this work what he went on, construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">We went there to the people, they're called Sokinote (ph), where they're giving specialty places, you know, <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where they're giving fair to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">So they said, on person was sitting, like a heavy man, he said, "I have all of this work, I can't give you no other one, I don't have it". </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So this is the only thing, my husband took the work and the only thing what I said to him, I said, "how many times we have to get through everything, to start from the beginning". </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And that's what start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">We had our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , like they gave us, the government, we had to pay a certain amount money, and they build specially <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for the new come in, and we had already established. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , and I was so happy, and I

bit but I forgot, you know, when I was a child I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But my daughter went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she start to talk right away in Hebrew, in fact she went to the second grade, and they were happy and I was happy with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Then all of a sudden came the visa with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I was so unhappy to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I left only because I had my sister here, otherwise I would never, never in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Here start again, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">All those with hard times, with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Alright, I came to my sister and I had by her, I was by her for 11 months, not quite a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I gave birth to my son, and was blessed by her in the <span

nobody wants me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">With two children nobody wants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Nobody wants me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Till I find an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and my sister used to say, "why you want to go out"? </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It was no good, she was our family. </span><span
