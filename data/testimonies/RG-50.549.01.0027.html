<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  | want to ask about the family that you stayed with, what, what was their nationality and do you remember anything about them and your attitude toward them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  | did not stay with families, these are the people that ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">These were the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi homes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  You were in a vacant <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And who, was there food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  As | said, the Russian soldiers, the occupiers brought us food and medicine and that's how we were being helped to, you know, to get stronger again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  I'm trying to get a picture when you say we, was there a group of people who you were close, closer to than the others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  No, not basically, just people who survived and if had two sisters survive, naturally they would stay together or like my mother and | survived so we stayed together and we were just trying to get some food and medicine to try to get stronger so that somehow we could get, head back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to look for our families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  But you and your mother were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> with lots of other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, there were, as | mentioned originally, there were about 500 women there from the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and then the next 500 were us, who were taken later, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">| might just see what I'm touching and what I'm not touching there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And this is the part that's very important, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">As | mentioned, the Russian soldiers were helping us with bringing food and medicine to this <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , where the empty <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that we, they have places us after the German SS ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And took us several weeks, I'd say about three, four weeks until we had enough energy to sort of walk around and just even think about going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And that we did because the only thought that we had in mind was to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because we were hoping that if any of members of our family, would do the same and that we would meet there and be a family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">When my mother and | arrived, we went straight to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and when we approached it there were people living in there and they were looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> which faced the <span class="DLF">street</span> and of course when they recognized us, they got scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They said, "What? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">You return, you survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We were told that you were all killed and now that you survived and now you are back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you will want your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back and you will want your businesses back. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">This is terrible, we thought that you were all killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My mother and | looked at one another and my mother said, "No, we don't want our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back, we do not want our business back and we don't want to live among you. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Anyone who was our neighbor and business partners or business associate and this is the kind of greetings that we get when you see that we had survived, we don't want to or we are unable to live among you again." </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my mother and | turned on our heels and walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We walked to the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , where there were already some of the survivors who also went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , trying to find families and | don't remember now whether we were put into a big <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , somebody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or rather a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , but we were placed somewhere again while we were waiting to see if my father or my brother will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Because most of our families, you know, like mother's parents and sisters and brothers, lived in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So basically here we were waiting for my father and my brother, hopefully that they would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And so, several weeks passed by and every day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to see if by some miracle my father or my brother would be on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And then weeks went by and they were not on there and so one of the men, who was a former citizen of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he apparently had pity on us, because we been doing this now for weeks after weeks, going to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> every day and my father and my brother didn't show up so he called my mother on the side and myself and he said that we should not wait, we should get away from here as far as we can, excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Because my father and my brother are not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So my mother asked how does he know? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And he said that he was in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with them and he saw them die, so he knows that they are not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So with that, my mother turned to me and she said, "You know, we fought all this time so that we have our family hopefully together again and we suffered all of this and then, now that the war is over, we found out there was no reason to fight and to suffer, because there is no family left. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We should take our lives now, because it's worthless, it's useless." </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And | said to her that | had just turned 15, nine days before the war was over and | said all | knew in my whole young life is suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">| would like to go on living to see if there is anything better in this world, if there are better people, if there are kinder people and if there is a better life. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So she said that if that's what | want, then her job as a mother was to go on with me, to help me survive and go on and try to make a new life for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So at this point we packed up the couple of things that we had and we were leaving our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> but at this point it was hard to get over there already because the Soviet Union occupied this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The one thing | forgot to mention that my father had hidden some dollar bills and some jewelry before we were taken away and he showed it to all three of us that if we didn't know what was to happen to us, that is anybody came back, to see where it was so maybe it will help us go on when the war is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Could you describe, did you have to sneak in to the <span class="DLF">yard</span> to find that money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Yes, what happened was, the money and the jewelry, my father hid in one of these small mason jars, sealed and he buried it in one of our <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And because we knew that we have these neighbors that used to be our good neighbors and friends and they greeted us in the manner that | just described, we certainly didn't want to dig for it during the day where they would see us and possibly hurt us. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So at night we took some shovels and the two of us and went there and we dug up the money in the one jar and the jewelry in the other jar and we took that money and some of it we paid border guards between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> so that we could get out already and the Russian soldiers were there, so in order to be able to get out of there and go over to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> where my mother's, a lot of my mother's family lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so we gave them quite a bit of this money so that they would get us out of there and that's how we were able to get away already at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then we live in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , this is again <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , where they changed again in 1940, it became <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> again and then after the World War 2, 1945, it became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And my mother had sisters there and other family and so we thought we'll stay there and see if any of those members of the families might have survived and come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Where were you at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  This was, it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , which is the southeastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  What was the <span class="DLF">roof</span> over your head?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  At that point, we had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a one bedroom apartment that somehow, my mother's brother lived there prior to the war and so somehow they kept that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for him so when we came back and my uncle survived and he came back, we moved in together and we lived there and we stayed there for close to a year, again, waiting for hopefully family, to trickle back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  In a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  It's not a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was a fairly decent sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it's called Satoumary(ph) in Romanian and the Hungarian name was Satmarnamaty(ph) and so we stayed here close to a year again, hoping for somebody from the family to come back and actually one more sister came back, out of eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Your mother's sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then...
QUESTION:  Could you describe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Do you remember her return?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  | don't quite remember, well | remember the return because we were all just hugging and kissing and you know, we somehow were all lived in this one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom apartment</span> because it was very difficult to get anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And it was just, you know, hope and despair because despair was that, you know, my mother had eight siblings and only two of them came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Her parents were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">All the nephews and nieces and cousins, all of them were dead, all of them were killed, there was just this few of us, handful of us that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And again, we didn't want to stay there either, because there are a lot of the people were anti-Semitic again there as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And so we didn't want to stay there, we were hoping that we could possibly emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And the reason we wanted to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because my mother's only sister, who got away just, couple of months before the war broke out in 1939, that she had left and so we wrote, well, her, fortunately | remembered her address in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , | was all of, what, 13 and | wrote to them, you know, there's a couple of us survived and we would like to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> so that we can be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And so one day she found out about this, you know, then of course they arranged for all the necessary papers, which was quite difficult because at that time the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did not want to let in much, many people of the <span class="REGION">eastern European continent</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Could | ask you something? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Do you, did she save that letter that you wrote to her, your aunt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  | don't think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  | don't think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  So you don't have any letters like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  No, that one | don't have, what | do have letters from my father and my grandfather and from my uncle, who wrote to their sister here or their daughter, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  This same woman we're talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That basically, | have other letters that my father wrote my grandfather, the father of the girl that was here and her brothers and sisters, writing to them, this is going back to 1937, '38 and even the very beginning of '39, begging them to do whatever arrangements they can for us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , you know, because the, it looked like the war was imminent and if they cannot help all of us, at least they should try to get my brother out, who was a teenager and my father, my parents were afraid that they will take him into the army and God knows where he will wind up, if he'll wind up alive at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So these are letters that | have here, in the original handwriting of my father and my grandfather and uncles and aunts, who are begging them to try to do something, but it was too late at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Were you able to receive a reply from her or did you just never hear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  No I, we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The only thing that | do have a copy of is, where this daughter, this sister who lived here, wrote to the American Red Cross, looking for her parents and this was already the beginning, of 1944, in April '44, maybe a week or two after we were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And so she did not get a reply, but she does have a copy that the American Red Cross did receive this inquiry. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So | have a copy of that, my aunt has the original. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So this is something that, you know, is very, very precious because, you know, she was looking for them and we were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or when day, you know, days after they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  You mentioned, we're back now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with your surviving family members, you mentioned anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">What was it about the environment that, that happened that made you know or feel or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well basically you know, we had this practice already, we had practice for many, many years, you know, what it was like and with anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">First very subtle and then if, after a while it wasn't subtle any more, they would just say whatever they felt or if people came back and they opened up their own <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> that they had before, they were, you know, really angry at them and they let the people know that you don't belong here any more and you shouldn't have the businesses here, nor should you live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So when we saw all of this, this was when we decided that it was time to move on from here, too, because this is not a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for us any more either. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Nobody wants the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And so this is when we decided to try to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know, different people were trying to go to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Some to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , some to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , some wherever they would accept us because you've probably read about it, that most <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> did not want us, including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">You know if you heard about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Saint Louis</span> , where 1000 people were turned away, first from <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and then from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and no other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> wanted them so most of them wound up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> really wanted the Jews whether it was during the war or even after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  So when you went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , you were there for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  As | said, a little less than a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  And after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  That's when we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because they, you know you could not emigrate from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> or from these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Only from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and those are the places where the displaced, where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So there were, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of people who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> but they had nowhere to go, so they were all just hanging around in some of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now some of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were actually <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , prior. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And then of course, the SS went away, ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Some of them were, these were mostly <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> and so when we were in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It's called Poking(ph) and it was a rather large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And so we waited here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  When you say we, who do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  My mother and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So you said good-bye to your relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes, stay, one of them stay there, she got married and stayed there, her sister and the brother stayed there for awhile but then he also came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , also about 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  And the distance from where you were to where you went, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , how did you get?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Again, you know by this time they had some railroad, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , but more or less regular <span class="DLF">railroads</span> so we would hitch rides on them or we would hitch rides with farmers and pay them something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Because there was no other transportation and we wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where, that was the only place we could emigrate to, either <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Q: This is the end of Tape 1, Side A.
ANSWER:  Okay, so in order to seriously thinking about move, you know, coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where my mother's only surviving sister came, we had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and stay in one of these displaced person's camps, where most of the survivors of World War 2 and primarily of course the Holocaust survivors, since we had no other <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that we made this, these camps our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and trying to make whatever arrangements have to be in order to be able to emigrate, whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The reason we wanted to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was because my mother's sister was here and she's the only one that was able to get away before, just before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And so | remembered her address and wrote to her that a few of us survived and that we would like to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and could they make the arrangements? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And so we got a letter back, oh by all means, you know and they would have to do, they would do whatever they have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">In other words they had to guarantee that we would not be a burden on the United States government, that we would have a job waiting for us and a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> waiting for us and that we will not be any kind of burden of the government or of the United States citizen, that we would not take away their jobs, their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So they filled out all these forms and whatever else they needed, but being that we were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and that quota system is very, very small, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Even the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> allowed only a very small number of people annually to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there were certain <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that had even less, | mean a minute amount of people that they would let in annually. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we were unfortunately among those. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So we had to sit here, in this displaced person's camp, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poking(ph</span> ) until the beginning of 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Okay, now | know and you heard me mention that when I, it's very fresh on my mind, your video interview, it was these, you were there for four years in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was these four years that | heard the least about. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Could you recollect as a 15 year old, through her eyes, who you were then, what you saw, where you slept, how you ate and how you socialized?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Well, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven(ph</span> ), which is the <span class="DLF">port</span> , that's the <span class="DLF">German port</span> , so we were taken there, oh | think about a week or so before that and we were in big, big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and that's where we were kept until this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was ready for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  And did you, was it uncomfortable on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Oh, who cared at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">At that point we knew that we were coming already to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and you know, we are looking forward to it, we didn't know, we were very anxious and very anticipatory, but also with hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">You have to have hope in order to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So we were hoping for to be able to start a new, decent life again.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Well | had nothing that survived, because when we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were stripped naked and everything was taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So | had nothing from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The only thing that | had and that | held onto and | just gave to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , was my little birthday book that was given to me just nine days before the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And that's all | kept and...

<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  The jewelry we had to sell, but not at this point yet, this we sold at a later date, but the money, the cash money that my father hid, is what we had used to pay off, you know, these guards, the border guards so we could get out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  So arriving, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was fantabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Our aunt and uncle showed us around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> , a million lights and everything else and it was very, very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We stayed here overnight in one of the, the <span class="BUILDING">Taft Hotel</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And so it was very exciting and very nice, but we were so worn and so worn and tired from all the excitement that we could hardly wait to be taken to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and so we could get some rest and decent, a good night's sleep and being somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Anew home. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">A <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  What was the name of your aunt who met you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Magda. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Her first name is Magda and she married a young man, Adolph Bergstein(ph), just before they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">You know my uncle, her husband, came with his family in the 1920's, through Ellis Island and he went back to visit his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in 1937 and that's where he met my mother's sister, who was a very, very beautiful 21 year old girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And they fell in love with each other and they got married and then, just in beginning of '39, before the war broke out, they, you know, came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">| mean he was here, but already, beginning of '39 there were problems, they didn't want people to come out and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So he had to actually return to Europe and take care of her papers so that they would let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So that they came out just before the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Was there anything about arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that you recall, even a very little thing, that was different from how you thought it might be? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You'd had so much time to dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  Yeah, | think the expectations perhaps were a little bit bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">You know, when we arrived we thought that the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were, all of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> would be like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">skyscrapers</span> , everything would be huge, like described in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , everything would be very, very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So this was somewhat of a, not so much a disappointment, just more of a difference than what we thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  What about the food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Well the food took some getting used to, but for awhile we stayed in my aunt, you know, my mother's sister and she did do a lot of Hungarian cooking yet, so that was Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">One thing that | would like to mention at this point, which carries on into later life is this, when we arrived in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and this was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mining town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manassen(ph</span> ) <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And they, my aunt and uncle had a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there, they had a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and he made a nice living and they lived a comfortable life and they had made a lot of good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And about two weeks after we arrived there, my aunt wanted us to meet her friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So she made a little party, she gathered, you know, invited all her friends and we were just talking because as | mentioned, my English was such that | could carry on a conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So when she had invited these friends, several of them asked me certain questions pertaining to the Holocaust and I, you know, | explained to them in simple, short way and it seemed to me like human beings, being interested in other human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And | felt that was natural and felt it was warm and felt welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Until one of her friends said that, "You know, that's enough conversation about that Holocaust already, let's just forget about it.". </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And that was like a knife being stabbed, you know, in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">This is, we are just after the Holocaust being over. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">11 million people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Innocent people were killed and this is just 1949, four years later and people are first coming to the, from these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and a few here, a few there. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So many million peoples were killed for nothing and then she says let's not talk about it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was devastating to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  This is the end of Tape 1, Side B. End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Tape 2
QUESTION:  Now you've just arrived in, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> with your aunt, you and your mother and you've met a few of her friends and your relationship with your mother in this case must have been very close because you were the two, the only two who knew, out of all those other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Could you talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Yes, our relationship, | mean we were so, we couldn't be closer if we tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We could just look at one another and understand the other person, what goes on in the other one's mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We were in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manassen(ph</span> ) with my mother's sister, for a short time, a very short duration, from the March, beginning of March when we arrived until the fourth of July when we went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to visit a couple of my mother's cousins and an aunt who came also in the 1920's and my mother of course, didn't see them so we decided that we would go to visit them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And when we were talking about, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manassen(ph</span> ), this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my aunt lived and my age being just 18 and that there was really very little for me to do in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we had many conferences with the cousins and the aunt that we had there and they advised that instead of staying in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> that we stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> instead, where we have a better chance of starting a new life, whether it's going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or working or the combination or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">You see, | had a problem, a very, very big problem when | came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , cause as | mentioned before, although | already was 18 years old, | was really just 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Because | haven't learned anything between the age of 13 and 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Plus the fact | was still scared of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Living in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , whether it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or later in the displaced person's camp, and | never had a normal relationship with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">This was not a normal lifestyle that | had all these years, so | was scared silly of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">| also did not have a good working relationship with people my age, because we had nothing in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Those girls that | met through the family, at age 18 were dating and going to the <span class="BUILDING">movies</span> and <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and all of that, all those things were unknown to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They were talking about boys and all, you know, the dating and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It meant nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Even when | got my first job, through the family, my stomach was so nervous just getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and going to work and not to know what to expect there, all the unknowns, everything that was unknown was so scary that the first several years and I'm not talking about months, first several years, | was having a real hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">| couldn't go out on a date, that, that was foreign to me, it was very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">As | said, when going to a job was very, very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Meeting people, in general, was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , one of the things that kept me from staying there was that the children, or the young people that were my age were not Jewish and so | had, again, nothing in common with them because and especially not just that they were not Jewish but they were not in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , they were not living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , their life was completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Or they were very young children, so there was nobody for me to have relationships with. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Or understanding one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Except your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Except my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But no, no people my age, so | had really nothing to do in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we were talking about these things, the, you know the good sense was that yes, we should stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So which we did, we stayed with this aunt at first, for a short while, then we rented a, a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> , where we stayed for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Then we got our first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which at that time was like impossible to get, but what we had gone through in lack of privacy that | described to you, that was the only thing, now that we had our freedom, that was the only thing my mother and | wanted and I'm sure all the Holocaust survivors, some privacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  What did she do to earn this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  So my mother, her cousins found her a job, again taking care of people because that's what she was always best at. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So she was working in an <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> and so she was making money there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And | went to, to work in one of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , again a cousin, where they taught me how to work a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> and so | was making some money there and then | finally met a young man, an American born college graduate and he somehow talked me into going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because my family wanted me to and | still saw <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anti-Semitic in everything the way it was back in Europe, so | didn't want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So this friend, this young man that | met, said, "I tell you what, you sign up and | will come with you."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Can | ask you how, under what circumstances you met this friend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">After, as | said, for several years | was not very good socially with anybody here, but one of the cousins in the family used to go away on weekends or on vacations to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where they had single groups, you know, where they would meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And in one weekend, she talked me into it and | went with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And | met this young man there and somehow it seemed like he had empathy and understanding of what | have gone through and he knew a lot about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and all that, so we sort of hit it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And so | started to go out with him, you know, with other people, with other young people because alone | was still scaredy-baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But anyway, so he talked me into going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he said, well of course only in the evening because during the day | worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So he would sit with me in the evening, in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for | think maybe six months or so until | got used to it, then | saw that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here was not the same as anti<span class="BUILDING">-Semitic schools</span> that | had to go through before we were taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  What did you fear in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> might happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Basically the hatred of the Jews and you know, what happened was in Europe, then when | went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , if | deserved an A or a B, | would get maybe a D, just passing grades, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And so it's, it was very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Again, among those things that were very, very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But finally | stayed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and while | was there is where | met my husband to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">This other fellow took me there, but | met my husband to be there, who was also a Holocaust survivor and who lost all his family there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  Could you tell me what, what <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  Yes, that was Theodore Roosevelt evening high school in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Fordham University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  So was he in a class together, ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  We were not in the same class, but he heard me speak Hungarian to someone there and so that's how he asked me if he could drive me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he seemed like a nice enough young man and maybe by that time | was getting, warming up a little bit that | wasn't quite as scared as | was the first few years because this was already 1955, you know, so this is six years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  And you were then how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  At this point | was 25, | had just turned 25, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  It must have been such a thrill to meet someone who you had so much in common with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">This was something, that we had a lot in common with and...
QUESTION:  Were you actually able to approach the subject of the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Could you tell me a little bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  That was one of the first things that we talked about, because when you meet someone, you try to find things that you have in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And of course what did we have in common more than having been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , having lost all our families, trying to make a new life for ourselves and how we are going about trying to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And then my husband was also in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">No sooner that he arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he was, he was taken, you know, to the Korean war, <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And so things of this sort, that we were, had a lot in common with and talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And, now of course we spoke about what we would like in our lives, now that we are here and we would like, we should try to put the past behind us and try to start a new life and perhaps have children and you know, to live a normal life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Try to forget all those years, wnat we have gone through and everything and everyone that we have lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And so all of these things were things that we had in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And we both wanted to, you Know, speak English better and you know, try to do the very best we can with what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">| mean we were young kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  You said you were from different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , but...
ANSWER:  Yeah, but not terribly far away, because where | was born is, was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the northeastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , while my husband is what they call the <span class="REGION">Transylvania area</span> , which is <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But those were like 50, 60 miles away from one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  And he lost both of his parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  Oh, he lost his parents, his brothers, his sisters, his aunts, uncles cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We both as well as all the other people, lost at least 90 percent of our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So he was all alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  Your heart must have really gone out to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  Yeah, because he had no one, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  And so that was touching you a great deal.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Oh, is it going? </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Well, basically at this point, now this is, we're talking about end of 1955, we were planning our wedding, which was February 4th, 1956 and we had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because it was still very difficult to get anything bigger or better in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And we both were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">My mother lived just a couple of blocks away from us and so we saw each other almost, quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">She would invited us for dinner, you know, after work and on Sundays we spent time together and some of course with just friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But we, our relationship remained very, very close with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Then two years later, | had a little boy, Mark and at the same time, when my oldest son was born, my mother remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And that is an interesting story because, of course, she wasn't looking at this point to get married, we were still in a lot of pain and we were not thinking and she surely wasn't thinking about, you know, getting married again. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The pain was still quite deep and strong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But this same sister in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> had good friends and one of them knew about this gentleman who had lost his wife just several years prior. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And he was born in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> right next to where we lived back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And so she thought that maybe the two of them could hit it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And so they invited my mother, you know, down to <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> and they met and it seemed to have worked very nicely, he was a very, very nice man and he was lonesome, you know, he had lost his wife and my mother was alone, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">| mean, she lived near us, but still she was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And they got married, that same time when my first son was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And they moved, you know, she moved to, where he lived.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  She moved to <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> this point and they had a very nice life for five years and then they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , to one of his niece's weddings and while they were there in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that they were staying in, he had a heart attack and died in front of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So the poor woman, not enough that she had to survive all she had to survive and lose everybody, it, like five, six years later, she, same thing have to happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So that was a devastating time. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And we made her move in with us because we didn't want her to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And at this point, you Know, we had a little baby and so we were taking care of a child and my mother was living with us and we lived a very good, normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And you know, you're busy with a child, you tend to not focus so much of the past, you tend to live one day at a time in taking care of the child, enjoying it and have a good married life and it was just, the first time | think that some of this stuff was not thought of every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The only time that it did happen, that we would think about it of course is both of us and most of the survivors, I'm sure, have gone through that, is where we would have some nightmares that things would come back from the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The slightest little thing could set off nightmare, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You would see a person in a uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Didn't have to be a police, it didn't have to be anything like that, but it would trigger off something. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And then of course at night you would have these horrible nightmares and you'd be screaming on top of your lungs and jump up and the perspiration pouring off your body because you're actually reliving this. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And this has been gone for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">In the first years, much more often than in later years, but even now, occasionally it will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">My husband, many times that he feels that he's fighting back, you know, when he would wake up all in a cold sweat. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But as | said, this is now on a rare occasion, but for several years this was a pattern and we accepted that this is how it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  When you had these nightmares and you would wake up in the morning and remember, did you repeat what you had dreamed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Yeah, we repeated it basically to one another and then tried to go on and you know, try not to think about it much and this is the good part, you know, that we tried our best to start anew. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Tried our best not to think much of what took place, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But of course you can't just get rid of years, years of pain, years of suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It just, you know, we tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Were you living around a lot of other survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">There were a couple of good friends that we had and we are siill friends with them although they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and one in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We are, you know, still constantly in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They were the only ones that were really, we did any talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">When, again, when we would see something, that would trigger things off. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We were not trying to talk about these things, we would try to get it out of our systems and you know, you try to concentrate, they had little children, we had little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">You know two years after my first one was born, | had another little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And we tried to live as normal life as possible, but occasionally things, we would see, and it happens today. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I'll see something and it will trigger off something that | have seen 50 some odd, you know, years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  Did | ask about your feeling about how to talk to your children, whether or not to tell your children or when to tell your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  Well this is a very difficult and individual things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Most of us survivors were not able to talk to our children about our experiences, about what happened, for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">| don't know what the reason was, | guess basically most of us believe that we didn't want, want to hurt our children, we didn't want them to live through the things that we have lived through. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">In other words we were trying to protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Not like a, a, a lion cub but 10 times more. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Because that was the thing and | think our problem still is, those of us that survived and we have children, we became overprotective. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Sometimes to the point where it's harmful. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Nevertheless, that's how it is, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  And this was one of the number one ways you would overly protect, by not telling them anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  That was...
QUESTION:  Did they ever ask you or hear about it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Well later on, when they were a little bigger and they started to ask if they saw certain things that we would read or if they overheard us talk to these couple of friends, you know, about certain things, they would ask questions, but that's about all and we would give them a very simple answer and not going into too much until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Now, whether this was the right thing or wrong thing, | don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">In our case, of course they have learned much more later, because | did not, we did not talk much about it until, let's see, 1978. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">This was when we already lived in a different <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New City</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which is upstate, in <span class="REGION">Rockland County</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">At this point we had a very beautiful one family home and we lived a, the nicest time of our lives since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> took place there, in the seven years that we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We had the boys, they had friends, we had friends, we had a lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and so it was just a very, very nice lifestyle. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But we still, the friends knew that we went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and occasionally something would come up, we would talk about it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Sometimes our children heard about it and we'll answer them but not going into detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">My children learned much more starting in 1978 when we were living here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New City</span> , the rabbi from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> where we belonged to, is a conservative rabbi, asked another lady and myself if we would put together a Holocaust remembrance program in April, which was, you know, the Day of Remembrance, called Yom Hashewah(ph) and | was taken back a little bit because as | said, we really didn't talk about it as such, but this other lady that he asked and | sat down and we did put together a remembrance program and that was presented on the Day of Remembrance, Yom Hashewah(ph), 1978. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And...
QUESTION:  And how old would your sons have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Well one was born in '60, 1960, the other one was born in 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So this was already about 20, 18 and 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So they...
QUESTION:  Then they were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  And they were there, as were most of the, a lot of the Jewish people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And they have heard a lot there and then that October, that same year is when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , where immediately | got involved with the Holocaust survivors group which was forming at that particular time here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So we moved down in 79 and a couple of months later | was very much involved already in the Holocaust survivors group that we put together and from then on, because of the things that | have been doing since 1980 is where they really have learned everything about the Holocaust and they have learned quite a bit, about our physical experiences, about our emotional experiences, our relationship with other survivors and they themselves understand much more, people who have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and lost everything, so they have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge of what took place and what we are living with, all as survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  So we're going back a little bit to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Well basically when we started out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> and where we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">one bedroom apartment</span> and my first son was about a year and a half old, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , we bought a <span class="BUILDING">two family home</span> and we hoped that we'll be able to support it, both of us working and...
QUESTION:  You didn't mention your work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  That time | was only working, you know in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> because | didn't know anything else, but after | went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the evening, | changed my job and | worked in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and | was working in <span class="BUILDING">office</span> until | got, until my first son was born, so | was working there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  And your husband's job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  And my husband was in the frozen food distributing line for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">In fact for, he worked for one company for 22 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So we lived in Laurelton(ph), which was a nice family-oriented <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">The <span class="DLF">street</span> we lived on, there were 271 families with children more or less the same age, so our children had good friends and they didn't know much about our past at this age, you know, young age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Was this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  It was quite a, there were quite a bit of Jews, in fact | think most of the people who lived on our <span class="DLF">block</span> , the 21 families, | think most of them were Jewish, so the children had a lot in common, when they started <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and things of that sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Bar Mitzvahs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  And the Bar Mitzvahs, you know, they went to each others Bar Mitzvahs, Bat Mitzvahs, they had all their birthdays together and it was a very quiet, beautiful lifestyle, we lived there for 13 years and it was something that, it was good for all of us, because we didn't think much or talk much about our past, but lived our present and trying to raise our children and so it was good for us, for the children it was good because they had all their friends and they were doing things together, so that was a good lifestyle for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And then the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> started to change and people were moving in and out and was getting very unstable and the children were having some problems in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Their lunch money was taken away and all of these things, so the <span class="REGION">area</span> started to change and we decided it was time to move on and at that point we had some friends who moved, who lived in a very beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> up in <span class="REGION">Rockland County</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New City</span> , to be specific and they talked us into going up there to look around and we fell in love with the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we found a beautiful one <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> there and so we made the move and again we were very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">The boys were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and they were, had good friends and we made some very good friends through the sisterhood and the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And we lived very nicely, very comfortably and talking very little about our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Trying to just live in the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  | just wanted to ask that, was this also a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  No, this was a fairly new community per se and so there were Jews and non- Jews as well, but we felt that the boys were at an age where they would be going, you know to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and such that it would be good for them to be involved and for us to be involved so that we can do things together and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  To be involved in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  In a, a nice lifestyle where they can learn about more Judaism and being educated in the Jewish religion and learn more about their past, per se, | mean not so much what happened to as as to, more to know about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You know, like religious celebrations and reading, how to read Hebrew and things of that nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Are there times when you learned also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Well in a way | learned, | did not take any formal Hebrew education there because, well | don't know, because. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But | had some Hebrew education when | was going in in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in Europe, you know, before we were taken away and so | was not involved per se in theirs, except supervising them that they are doing their work and like a mother, a good mother's supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But this is when we were there, where we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New City</span> and then in 1978 is when the rabbi asked us if we would, you know, make this program for Yom Hashewah(ph) and that's where | started a new career for myself so to speak, because few months later we moved from there to <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , where | got very much involved in the Holocaust survivors and then | can tell you a little bit more of what | have done since 1980, since | live here In <span class="REGION">Texas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I'm really looking forward to it, | think before that, maybe to your relationship with your mother, also your mother's health took a turn during this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  | may have to stop us because we'll have to go to another <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but you can begin now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Okay, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">When my mother was married, as | said that her husband had died in front of her, she was devastated and we made her move in to, in with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And at that time we had the two family home in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> and we had tenants in the <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs apartment</span> , a young couple with a little girl and we had asked them if they would find other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live because we wanted my mother to have more comfort than we could provide in that, you know, in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And privacy as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So after this couple moved, she had moved upstairs into the other <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and our youngest son moved up with her to keep her company. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> right next to my mother's and so they kept each other company and that was absolutely great for both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They were sitting playing cards in the evenings and watching television together and it was really just a, a great thing for both of them but especially for my mother who needed, who needed warmth, who needed some comfort because to have gone through what she has gone through and now losing her second husband was another horrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So it was great because you know, we had our meals together and we were all close together, but came the evening, the two of them retired upstairs and they, you know, it was really marvelous for both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But then when we moved to <span class="REGION">Rockland County</span> , my mother had gotten sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">She had cancer of the colon and she suffered for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">| took her to the doctors there and then they discovered that was cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">| did not hesitate for a second, we went straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sloan-Kettering</span> , which is, you know, specifically for, the best <span class="BUILDING">cancer center</span> , you Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">She had surgery and she had suffered for two years and she needed chemotherapy every week, so | would take her to get the chemotherapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Then she would have to go to the oncologist every couple of weeks, or whatever and then her surgeon, so it was a, one of those painful experiences that lasted for two years, but | did everything that | had to and everything that they were capable of doing for her, | made sure that they take care of her and then two years later, in 1978, she passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And that same week that she had passed away, both my sons went away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So there were the two of us, three of them gone that same week. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So it was a, little difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  Youwere_—s_?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  No, | was still in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">This was in '78 in June.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  All right, | think this is a good time to turn over the tape, this is the end of Tape 2, side A.
ANSWER:  Well, this all took place in June of 1978, my mother passed on and while we were sitting Shiva, which is a Jewish way of mourning when a person, close family member dies, that we observe seven days of mourning the person and so right after the seven days passed, both our sons went away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So there we were, the two of us in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , rattling. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But our...
QUESTION:  Rattling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Rattling, in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , just the two of us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So then, my husband has a cousin here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , who has been trying to get us to move down here for quite a while but there was no reason, but at this point at the same, just about the same time, the company that my husband had worked for 22 years was sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And so a change had to be made and there were too many changes during that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So we decided that we'll come down to look around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> and see if there's anything really worthwhile to even talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And we did come down and within 48 hours decided to move down here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  Did you come in the winter by any chance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  No, we came down, | came, you know we came down in May and the weather was magnificent and so we decided that since the boys were in two different <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , we had no idea after four years, where they will wind up and we were in this big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and my husband, you know, just more or less lost his job after 22 years, so that was a big, time for a big change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  And your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  And my mother had just passed away so it was weeks, within weeks, tremendous, tremendous change, so we made a decision that the boys should to to the <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> of their choices at where they sign up and, but we put up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for sale in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New City</span> and then | came down to look around to find the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here and then my husband joined me to see if he agrees and we moved down by October, end of October we were down here, this was from June to October and it was a big change but we both started to work right away, and...
QUESTION:  What sorts of things...

<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  No, no, it's, | mean, his father was a rather poor man, he had a large family and he did whatever he had to, to make a, you know, a living for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So he did not have any kind of formal training and neither did his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So when my husband survived, again he had to start from scratch and work his way up to whatever and thank God | mean, with all the work and without the formal education, he still made a good living for all of us and he was always a tremendous father and husband and so we are married now almost 41 years so | can just look back at those years as wonderful and those few years that | had with my mother as being marvelous and I'm very thankful to her, helping me survive those horrible, horrible years. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">| can never be thankful enough to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And | hope one day we'll meet again. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And we are a very, very closely knit family, the four of us, although one son lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and the other one lives down in <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We celebrate all our good days, birthdays, anniversaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">In fact, for our 30th birthday, our boys made a very, very...
QUESTION:  Your 30th?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  30th wedding anniversary, our son's made us a very, very big surprise birthday party where close friends from years and years ago, they have come in from all over, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to celebrate our anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And if either one of us is sick, the boys are here immediately and if it's a birthday or a big birthday or anything special or holidays, we try to be together as much as we possibly can. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We are very, very close and I'm very thankful for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Since you understand so what it's like to lose family, | think it also gives you an understanding of what it's like to, to have family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  This is all that's important in life now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Although you did mention one thing about sometimes being a little bit overly protective.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  True, that is true, I'm sure we all are somewhat overprotective. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And sometimes they'll say so, Hey Ma, you know, go easy and don't forget I'm now 30 or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But they don't really get upset about it, they just try to say ease up a little bit Mom, you know, you're going a little bit too far, you Know, too worrying, you know and then | lay off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  For the 30th anniversary, as far as all the friends that came, were, was there a certain number of them who had also experienced the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes, a lot of these...
QUESTION:  Could you talk about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">ANSWER:  A lot of these friends, you know, who | mentioned, there's one of them that lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> that we are still very much in close touch with. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The other one in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And there are several of them that we have been very close with and still are. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And we talk to one another and if one celebrates an anniversary we just call up and, or send them cards or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That we do remember each other and the good times and the bad times, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So these are friendships that are not just superficial, but very deep understanding of one another and what our needs are of each other and of life in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And so, all these years we remember and we think about think you know about the life that we have gone through and trying to celebrate the good things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  You mentioned so many good things, family seems foremost and also making a good living, making a good <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Having security. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">As time passed and the awareness of the horror of the Holocaust became more real to the rest of the world, did that affect you and had you been aware that you were being a little bit secretive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Well | didn't feel that | was secretive, because | never kept it a secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">If any time | spoke to anyone, not necessarily Jewish, not necessarily people who have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but if we just had general talks or discussions about all kinds of things and it would come up through history, through the time, what happened in this year or what happened when that took place in the world and then | would say, "Well, | see it from it a different point of view because and these are the things how it used to come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Not necessarily hiding it nor putting it on public view, per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But if the opportunity was such that it contributed something worthwhile that | felt, then | would mention it or talk about it or a phase of it or you know, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  So you mentioned when you first go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and you were so horrified when the girl said, "That's enough of that Holocaust," | guess I'm trying to say, it sounds like, correct me if I'm wrong, that when you, when you were in conversation with the way the world saw the Holocaust versus your own experience, and movies too and just news clips and the way you saw it betrayed, even if it contradicted your experience, it didn't ever make you angry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Yes and many times | think about what it is really, why | did not talk about all of these things from the time that, you know, it was over? </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Was it because of this one terrible statement from this lady, | was wondering many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">That that was so painful that it could have caused me to silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But then | listen to other people and, thousands of other people also did not talk about it, because whether if it's with their children, they try to prevent the pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Whether it's with other people, because we felt that they really can't understand and not necessarily because they did not want to understand but because | feel that to understand, to really, fully understand and empathize with what happened to us, through us and through this period, one had to really be in it, to fully understand it and while we might have, you know, just a conversation and sometimes maybe even a little bit more serious conversation, a little bit deeper and going more into what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">The understanding of anyone, Jew, non-Jew alike, could not be there unless you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">There is just no way anybody can understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Some people will try, some people will empathize, some people will read a tremendous amount about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Some people will try to talk to as many survivors as to what happened to you, to learn from different phases from different people because each of us, you know, there must have been 12 different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> or more that were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">One may be <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and life was completely different there than it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">From <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> it was not the same as in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and so the background of all these people are so entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">The people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> might have been, or certain parts, I'm not talking about the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> where there was, you know, tremendous education. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But you know, like | described this older couple from the back woods of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , without any education, so if you put people together with highly education, educated people, let's say from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , these are two completely opposite ends of the, the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And so when you talk to one group of people from there, | mean they lived in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> without even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood stove</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">They did not learn, they did not know about what was going on this world as did the German Jew or the Austrian Jew or the French Jew or the Hungarian Jew, where there was much more education. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So these are completely different worlds apart and so everybody's going to look at things differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So if you're going to talk to a person from this end of the spectrum and then you'll speak to the other one at the other end, you're going to hear two completely different stories and lifes and so to understand all of this, you have to understand history and people who want to know about it, would want to read about it and would want to talk to a survivor about it because that's where they'll get the, the actual facts, the truth, wnat had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  In lieu of that, there were some pretty famous documentaries done about the Holocaust, | think in the 70's. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Did you see those, did you remember the first time you ever saw any documentaries or footage from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">| remember seeing the Holocaust, that was shown on television, the film series.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  That was in the 70's?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And that one was a disaster because it was primarily a show rather than the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  In a, wait a, by a show, tell me what you...
ANSWER:  Just to, to basically almost like make-believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">You know like putting it in the historical background, but it is more like, like Dr. Zhivago, that kind of feeling, you know, to show a lovely story. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">A little bit more dramatic perhaps but that was not the way to portray the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The one to portray the Holocaust are basically two films, as far as I'm concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">One is Shoa, which is a very long movie, S-h-o-a, which in the Hebrew means Holocaust and the other one is Steven Spielberg's, the Schindler's List. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And even and those are not 100% nearly as quite as bad as it really was, but they will give you more of the true facts as to what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  Can | ask you how did you feel when you saw Schindler's List?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  | was crying throughout and then a couple of week's later, or a few weeks later, it was available, you know, on rental. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">| rented it out again and | sat down by myself and watched it again and cried throughout again. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And if | see it 10 times, the reaction will be the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And | felt very much the same way about the film Shoa and | highly recommend people to see that as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">But above all | feel that the best way to tell people what happened, to teach people about the hatred, about what this whole thing was about, what the Holocaust was all about is by teaching people. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And those of us who survived, luckily well enough so that we can teach or share our experiences and try to teach especially the younger people what it was, what this whole thing was really all about and what we have to be warned against and what we can teach the young people, that they should never let this happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And for that reason, since | started to give that presentation for the Yom Hashewah(ph) in 1979...
QUESTION:  That was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Just shortly before you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  Just few months before | left and that started me on, on this trip on this journey that | have been on and am I, | am on and hope God will help me to continue on, teaching students going to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> , to civic organizations, to <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , where I've been doing this now for, since 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So it's 16 years, non-stop, where | share my experiences, what | have gone through, what life was like, what a beautiful life we had before and how that came to a sudden halt by Hitler marching into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And what living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was like, what it was like to live in a displaced person's camp for almost four years, not having freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Then coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , how difficult it was to get started because | was still a scared child and then little by little to work all my problems out and find somebody that | had a lot in common with, to marry and have children and start a new life and though | could never forget what | have gone through, | still have to, and | had to and | still have to make a new life for ourselves, for our sons and if when they get married, for their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And the only good thing that | feel | am doing is trying to teach people about what happened and how we can and how we have to, letting something like this happen to any human being anywhere on the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  Sounds like, you know we were talking about, you showed me some of the things that you're going to show me a little later...
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  ...about the coping mechanism...
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  ...the thesis and the book that the woman is writing...
ANSWER:  Okay, there is one young lady who got in touch with me that she is writing a book about how women coped in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  Specifically _?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Specifically women, how they were able and coping mechanisms and what kept them alive and my experience and I'm sure most of the other people will agree with me, that there was no one coping mechanism. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">There was no way that you could decide that if you go in this row, rather than in that row, that you will be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Because the Nazi may have decided that, at the spur of the moment, that that row is going to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> today and that row might go tomorrow or the day after. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So there was no such a thing as trying, you know, making it or able to make the right decision, there was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Survival in my opinion was a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Chance of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">| mean how could | have said, told that when | was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , after, when the raw material in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ran out and they took us out to dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">How would | have known that | was barely able to pick up that shovel, that that SS was not going to get mad as all <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and blow my head open, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So you could never tell what will happen to you from one moment to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Therefore it is strictly a chance survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Now as far as my mother helping me and my other two girlfriends, I'm sure they had similar experiences, where my mother would try to tell me, when they come around, when the SS comes by, try to make sure you show that you are working and you're trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That, yes, that helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Her giving me the part of her bread without my knowledge, without a doubt that helped me because | was just a 14 year old skinny little kid who was not used to this kind of abuse and work and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So these things yes, these things helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But there was no coping mechanism, maybe my friendship with these other girls was a little helpful, that | had somebody to talk to who was my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Perhaps all these little things added up, but | can't say that there was one thing, any time, anywhere during this whole period, that there was one thing that helped me other than these two things about my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  | know, Maddie, it's a very difficult subject, but and you've told me that to some extent, you religion has been therapeutic and | know that your family has been a very strong force in your continuing faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But there's been a lot of talk and things written about self-hatred over having survived at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Were you affected in this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  To some degree | was, because if | think of my mother's, my father's birthday coming up, if | think of my brother's, there isn't a time, in all these years that | don't think of them on their birthdays and | say, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="667">My father was a very, very good, charitable, kind person. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">My brother was only 19, just turned 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">What kind of bad thing could he have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So | say, "Why was | better? </span><span class="sentence" id="671">How was | better than either one of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So how come I'm entitled to live and they were not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And there is no answer, the same way there is no answer when you ask where was God all this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And we all asked that, every single one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And that's the same way, how come he let me survive and he didn't let my brother survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="676">How was | any better than he was? </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So these are all questions, good questions, bad questions, these are just questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">There is no such thing again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  How have you coped with these things, | mean have you, I've even understood that there are therapists that can't, can't be helpful because as you say, they haven't had the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Have you ever tried to communicate with...
ANSWER:  No, | have not tried for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">| don't know, it wasn't fashionable at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">See today, that's much more, you know, going to see a shrink, that's the second best than going food shopping, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So that was not the case at that time, it wasn't the practice, number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Number two, we would not have that kind of money to, you know, to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Number three, I'm not even sure...[pause]
QUESTION:  All right, we're resuming here after a short telephone break and a coffee break. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Very good coffee and very good fruit and what we began to talk about was the value of the Holocaust survivors group and your teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And it seems, it almost seems that it's a value not just for others, but also for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Could you talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  Well, let's see, when we started with this group, you know, the Holocaust survivors, we got together for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Number one was for each other and that we can share some of it with each other, those who survived it, who understand it, who, we can just look at one another and we know what the other one means, because there is such communication that it doesn't have to be verbal and in this case, the Holocaust survivors practically don't have to talk about things to understand one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So this is a communication that is definitely between just survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And the other reason that came up a little bit later, because we remembered when some of the people who were killed and they said, their last breath, remember us, don't, not let us, do not let them forget us. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And basically, | mean that's not, you know, word for word, that was basically what they kept asking before they went to their deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Do not let us, do not let them forget us. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So this was a promise that probably all of us that survived made to ourselves, that we will not let the world forget them, because these were all decent human beings and they were just killed because they were Jews, or the other six million who were not Jews, but for various not important reasons, that they were being killed as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So this was one of the other things that we have promised, that we will not let the world forget what happened and what they did to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And so, as the war ended, the other thing that besides trying to find our families and trying to make a new life for ourselves, we also wanted to talk about the people that were killed and so when we started this group, the Holocaust survivors, one of our major reasons to getting together was to try to create some kind of a <span class="DLF">memorial</span> to remember all these six million Jews that were murdered for no other reason that they, than they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And in order to create some sort of a <span class="DLF">memorial</span> , we had to gather on a regular basis and plan whatever we could afford, whatever we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And that's what happened here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , when |, we moved down here the end of 1979 and we Started this group in the beginning of 1980, in fact we were planning on going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the world reunion of Holocaust survivors and a group of us went and when we were all together, you know, many thousands of people who were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and we realized that we can no longer postpone this and we can not dilly dally with it, we have to speak about what happened and we have to educate people what happened, whether it's verbally or they can possibly do a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or a memorial or whatever, that will speak for all these innocent people that were murdered and one of the most important things that we have decided on when we came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , from this trip, that we are really going to put a very strong emphasis in building something here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And so | was among the first ones, a small group of us that started really working on it and working on it hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It took us a long time because it was, we are talking about very serious money. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But after all these years, since 1980, '81, we finally opened this year on March the third, 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And | have put in an awful lot of time, effort, energy, helping build this. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Many, many hundreds of hours in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and taking work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and | think we have done justice and | feel that we have done a good job and we are telling the story the way it took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">In a simple way, but very straightforward and we are talking about everything that took place, people who were the murderers, we talked about the bystanders, who didn't lift a finger to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And we're also talking about, in there, about the people who helped, although very small in number, but there were those who helped and we have to definitely, | felt it was very important that we mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">In fact right now we have an exhibit, about four people who were diplomats and they saved, | believe it was, 15,000 lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Well, there's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and there was Sugihara(ph) in from <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and there are four of them that are being displayed right now, describing of what they did and how they did it and it's fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So we just started that exhibit two weeks ago and this is very important because there were some kind people. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">There were some fantastic people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chambourd(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="711">There were some magnificent people who took Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and shuttled it to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  And this is the end of Tape 2, Side B. We're going to Tape 3. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Tape 3
QUESTION:  Now we're talking about people who, who have helped, in all this horror and | want to ask Maddie(ph) if there's anyone in your experience ever, who has helped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  Well, the only thing that | can remember that anybody that ever did for me, as a kind gesture from one human being to another, was when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in , this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were working in the manufacturing of ammunition and we would march close to an hour to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> from the, you know, where we were staying, these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the same of course, coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And one evening as we were walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , it was already dark and | was walking on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , because we were marching in rows of fives and | happen to be, at this point on the side of the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and as we were marching, sort of dark, | saw this man passing by but | didn't pay much attention, | was much too hungry and much too tired, | was just dragging somehow to get back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">But | felt this man touching my hand, but my hands were so cold that they were frozen, | couldn't tell and then he, in German he says, "Take it already, take it." </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And so | took it, which turn out to be a little brown paper bag and | didn't dare to open it up as were marching, because if the SS would see me open it, | would get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So when we went back to the, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> | told my mother that this man that walked passed us handed me this little package so she said that let's wait until we go back where we go back where we can be alone and so we would open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And that's what we did and inside the package there were two thin slices of bread with just a little margarine holding them together and that was like a piece of gold, it was like a lifeline. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And so of course we split it and we ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">But that was the only kindness that | have seen throughout the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I'm sure there were other people who experienced something good here or there but it was not the norm at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Maybe later in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the displaced person's camp, there were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Well, that was already different ballgame, once we were in the displaced person's camp, you, that is not part of the Holocaust any more, that is past the Holocaust and life was a completely different routine and different lifestyle and as | said we were free at that point to more or less come and go as we wanted and although we were living in this awful <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, without any privacy, but that was, you know, that had nothing to do with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> any more and the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">The Holocaust was during the time that some of us were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , other's were murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or other camps, those that were hiding out in, possibly in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and they were possibly partisans and tried to survive that way, so this is the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  One of the things that | know you have talked about and | want to hear you talk on tape, is your experience at the <span class="BUILDING">national museum</span> , the Holocaust and...
ANSWER:  Well, the national, the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , | had been invited to give oral testimony back in 1990 and | found that very rewarding because when the opening took place and | went there and I've seen people's interest in there, it was very rewarding. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">| also have a statement in the voices of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and | didn't know that was utilized in there until | went there to the opening and when | sat down to listen to the voices of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> | heard my own and that was sort of shocking as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And that gave me even more incentive to be involved in trying to build something here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And so we did put in an awful lot of effort and | was one of the people of a handful of us that worked on the core exhibit of this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">We have a marvelous gentleman by the name of Professor John Roth, who wrote the text and there were four of us who went over it with a fine tooth comb and added and subtracted and did whatever we felt was necessary to make it as authentic, which was the major word for us, as possible and | think we have done a pretty good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We have thousands of people, adults as well as students from the surrounding <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> who are coming on very, very regular basis and they are praising it very highly, that it's very informative and very down to earth and it is, they think very highly of it and | must say that | feel very good about the job we have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And to me, what this represents is something that we are giving back, in other words we are keeping those promises that we have made right after the war, when those people who were murdered and yelled out in their last breath, "Don't let the world forget us." </span><span class="sentence" id="734">This is how | feel, that | have given back a little bit, that | have kept my word to all those people, that to teach the world, to tell the world what happened and hoping that everyone who sees this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and spends time there, will learn quite a bit about what happened and how they can think about it, that when something terrible happens, how they could possibly alter the course of that horrible thing that is happening and maybe to learn how they can stand up while so many others did not and those few who did, to learn from them and if anything bad does happen, that they will not let it happen, that they will speak up early, that it cannot become so as bad as it was during the Holocaust and the more we teach them, the better | feel about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And whenever we hear people who come and visit and they say that it was very informative and very very good, it is like, | mean | just feel marvelous that | was a small part of teaching people about what did happen and how we can avoid something like this from happening again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Can you think of an instance with a child, a moment when you were telling him a story or a response that a person or a child has had from your speaking to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">There were several young children who were about my age, because | always make sure | tell them my age, how old | was when all this started happening to me and | reached them very much because we are on the same age level and so many, many children come over and "May | hug you, may | touch you? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">| just want to tell you how wonderful you're explaining all these things." </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So all these things make you feel that perhaps I'm doing something or have done something worthwhile and at the end of our, the, the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , there is, like in the <span class="BUILDING">Washington museum</span> , voices of survivors and they have decided to use a couple of things that | have said during my tape, videotaping and so they're using it here and so that is the last part what, that one sees in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and expressing all of us, the survivors, who by the way are all people who live here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">All, this whole <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is basically telling the story through the survivors of the Holocaust survivors here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So everything that you see there, you know, you're going to see your friends, excuse me, telling about what happened here or there. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And some of the people that were the, you know, in this voices is my voice and how | tell a couple of different things that happened to me, as did the other people and it seems to be quite impressive, people like it very much, so | feel this is a very good <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that we're able to build and I'm very proud of it and | feel satisfied that | have done something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  You must have established lasting friendships with some of these other survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, most of us are very, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">In fact we have two functions a year, one of them is a Hanukkah dinner dance, which took place just two weeks ago and the other one is a spring luncheon where the children of the survivors honor the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So we get together on a very regular basis, formally and informally and we have formed some very good relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  Children of survivors is another subject, so I...
ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  ...we will not get into that today, but...
ANSWER:  Yeah, we have a group here also that had formed, children of survivors who are second generation and they are quite active here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  Well that's wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  I'm very interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Now, only, I'm sorry, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  Well | just wanted, at some point, you've told me off tape, your feelings and response when you first went into the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and | just thought that was...
ANSWER:  Yes, | went to the <span class="DLF">opening</span> and | went with my older son and as we started to walk through and | was making, as | saw things and | was making my comments to me son, it was just very, very painful and reliving some of that that | have seen there was very, very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">When we have reached the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and it was time to walk through it to get to the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , | couldn't make that first step to walk through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">My son suggested that we walk around it but | said, "No, everybody was able to go get through the Holocaust and | have, I'm going to walk through that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and remember all those people that were carried in them to their deaths." </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was a very, very painful journey, but one that | felt that | had to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">There was no way | couldn't, not have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And | went back again and spent about nine days there and here, now that we have the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here, of course | spend a lot of time here because | put a lot of the work into the, building the core exhibit and planning it. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But of course, talking to students and visitors alike about all the things that we have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and | hope that I'll be able to continue doing this and the reason I'm saying because at the moment, actually for awhile now, | have not been well. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">In December of '91, | had cancer of a kidney and that was removed and fortunately | didn't need chemotherapy and | was recuperating well, so that's while | was able to put all these years into this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that we have built here, but last June, in June of 96, | came down with a cancer of the colon and | was operated on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">This time the doctors decided to use some minor chemotherapy just to play it safe and while | was on this chemotherapy | developed a very bad pain in my back and the doctor told me to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span> , where they discovered pneumonia in that lung and a growth in the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Appears, after several serious check-ups and tests, they discovered that the colon, the renal cancer or the kidney cancer of 1991 metastasized into the lungs and so I'm not feeling so well right now because | am going through a lot of chemotherapy, but if God is good an willing to keep me alive, | have promised to continue my job of telling people about the Holocaust and | hope I'll be able to do that for whatever time I'm allowed. [</span><span class="sentence" id="764">pause]
QUESTION:  Now we are resuming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  Basically, right now, while I'm taking chemotherapy and doing a lot of rests at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , | am trying to put together a family tree, but basically starting with members of my family that were murdered in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">In other words, starting with my grandparents, who were the oldest members of my family that was, were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , their children, their grandchildren and all the way down to today, so that my children and perhaps when they'll have children, will learn about the family that they had, that there was a beautiful life prior to the Holocaust and to show them I'm trying to do it with pictures, whatever | can, wherever | can get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">From my one and only aunt that came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> just before the war and pictures from her and making copies whatever | can get, anything and as many pieces of information I'm able to collect from the couple of surviving members of the family and it's basically genealogy but | am not going back very far because right now I'm not well, but | want to do this for those of my, members of my family who were killed and even those few who survived and | would like this, to give this for my children, who did not know their aunts, uncles, grandparents or cousins, so that they will know their family, at least through these pictures and whatever information | can gather and write down for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So that is my preoccupation now, since the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">| feel this is very important to give to my children, to leave some sort of a legacy of their family. [</span><span class="sentence" id="770">pause] , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Wait a second, it had to happen before that because I'm trying to do them chronologically but | think this has been changed , this is my father and this is my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">See this is that Red Cross letter that | said that, the inquiry. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So that's the copy and those are the original letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  This letter from your father, would it be in another language?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  That's written in Hungarian, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Would it be difficult to read some <span class="NPIP">part</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  Well they could be enlarged and it will be much easier because his writing is like little pearls, you Know, so it shouldn't be so difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">This is my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Okay and this was our rabbi, this was our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and this is what they made out of it, you know, when the Russian occupation was there, they changed the whole thing, they made it look like nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So this is basically my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but it was ruined. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">This had a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and it had a <span class="DLF">center entrance</span> and it just, | don't know, they just ruined it. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And these are some of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that | went to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  So you went back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  We went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">| didn't ever even mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">You see in 1990 the four of us went back, because...
QUESTION:  Who was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  My husband, our two sons and |. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">We went back for the first time and the reason we did was, | really didn't want to because | knew that it was going to be very painful but when | spoke to the students and | stand in front of them and tell them about all these things, they always say, you know, it's marvelous that we do this, you know, those few of us who can because it's that, they say that it's one thing when you learn about it in a book and it's something else when somebody stands in front of you who was there and lived through this. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And so with that in mind | felt that when they opened up the Russian section, you know, and they finally let some outsiders go into the Soviet Union in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So | decided that it would be time to go back there and see things and for the boys to, our sons to see where we come from and see whatever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So we went back to my husband's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and there wasn't one Jew that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And there was nothing there that belonged to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Then we went back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and we found my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as you saw, but in horrible shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And then from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And this is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , these pictures are all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and these, this is the urn, when you walk into the, into the <span class="BUILDING">Auschwitz museum</span> , this holds the ashes of millions, of thousands of people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">This is one a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pedestal</span> and that's a big urn and that has some ashes from those that were burned to death there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And so we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , which was a horrible, horrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Nevertheless that too had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Perhaps if nothing else, just healing for my husband and myself, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And these are some of the pictures that my friends gave me also for my 15th birthday, just before the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Where they got these pencils and papers | don't know, because where, the section of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where | worked, | couldn't get any of these things, but apparently a couple of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And they are showing here the pictures, lined up, of five rows of fives marching to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And then here are pictures of after the war of my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And some of them are terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And then of course the displaces <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">person's camp</span> where, this is the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my mother worked and this is...
QUESTION:  Is she in this picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  Yes, she is in the picture right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I'm sorry, here she is, oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And then this is the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where | was learning how to sew and these are some of the dresses that we have made and this is taking a test and | was congratulation that | passed the test on that one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  Who was taking these pictures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  Again by that time there were some people who were able, you know, had some money and were able to buy a camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So this must have been maybe the brother of my girlfriend, you know, taking those pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And these are pictures where | was learning how to become a dental technician and this was the teacher right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And then these were some of the friends that I've made there. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And one of these, the one in the middle here is one of the girls that | was together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> with originally and then we met again in the displaced person's camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And this Is, let's see, summertime and wintertime, you know, the seasons, when you are there four years, you know, you go through all the different seasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And there's my mother with a friend at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and this is a girlfriend that | was so close with, this is, she got married in the displaces person's camp and this is her wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And | guess that was a maid of honor that | was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And this is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven camp</span> where we were held for a week or so before putting on the, being put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And then this is a very short period after we have arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And here's my mother and myself and two little cousins and this is some of their family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">QUESTION:  Is that you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  That's me, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  You looked very happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  Oh of course, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">It was just a couple of weeks after we have arrived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And this is a copy of my becoming a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Of course, you know, you had to...
QUESTION:  Your maiden name is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And then this is already later on when | was a little bit more relaxed and have gone through the worst of you know, socializing and work and all of that, so this was already in the 50's, early 50's.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  Who is that gorgeous girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">ANSWER:  That was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Once upon a time | had a good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">But even that has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And this is here with my husband-to-be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  On the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And this is our engagement party and then our wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">This is on our honeymoon in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And then this is one of the ceremonies, you know the Jewish ceremonies when a boy is a week old and they trim the penis, then as a celebration it's called a bris. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So this is that particular party, which is one of the most important celebrations in a Jewish boys life. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And this is a certificate of that that took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">QUESTION:  Okay, we're going to go to another subject and something we spoke about on our break was your husband's feeling about speaking about his experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">ANSWER:  Well he has much more difficulty with speaking, as a matter of fact whenever I've tried to go over it a little bit, you Know, just see if he could bring it out, but we have tried many times, but apparently he's having a very tough time sharing or getting in touch with these feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Maybe my healing mechanism is talking about it although it is very, very painful every time | talk about it because | relive this every single time. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But perhaps this is my way of coping. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">He has a difficulty talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">He is able to, if we have a conversation with friends and we reach a point in the conversation where it, we are talking about, pertaining something to the Holocaust, he is able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">But so far he was unable to sit down and share his experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">But hopefully, if | get well soon enough, we're going to try it again, because | think it is very, very important that we share our experiences, for one thin, to discredit the people who are claiming that there was no Holocaust and also for those people who come after us and I'm afraid there is too little written about it in school books where the children can learn about it and so whatever way that they can learn about this most horrible happening of the 20th century, | think it is very important that they learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">QUESTION:  And isn't it also for your own healing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">ANSWER:  Well this is what | said, for me perhaps it is a form of healing and maybe that's one of the reasons why | am and have been doing it all these years, but I'd like to think more that I'm contributing even in a little way. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">A little share in teaching the people what happened and making sure that it is not forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And this is the way | prefer looking at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  Is there anything, out of all the things that we've covered, that you want to go over again, or that you would like to add to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  Well, | don't know, | haven't thought about all these things for quite some time so it's difficult to pinpoint just exactly one thing or another that |, | see | would like to repeat but | think the most important thing that | see for myself is to continue educating people because the sign that | had suggested for our <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and it was accepted by the people that | was working with, was from Primo Levee(ph), where he says, "It happened, therefore it can happen again." </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And | feel that this is so very true and | feel that we have to repeat it and repeat it countless times, to teach people what happened and trying to teach them to stand up and speak up when they hear or see something terrible happening to any human being at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And since that sign is in front of my eyes all the time, that it can happen again, then my personal wish is, that as long as | can speak and as long as I'm well enough to do it, | would like to continue teaching people and telling people what happened and I'm hoping that they are learning from it so that if they do see something said or done to a human being that should not be done, that this time there will not be so many bystanders, but instead, rescuers. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And | hope | will help or | am helping to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Thank you so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  You're very welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION:  God bless.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  It's not a very good job but, you know, can't always be very good right? </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Some of our days are better than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Conclusion of Interview. </span>
