<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Do you know if they were Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  No, they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Neither one of my parents were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We were a very Reform type of a Jewish family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Did you have as — any kind of religious training as a very young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yes, we did go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> every Friday as long as the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We even learned some Hebrew and we knew how to say the prayers in Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  And how did you learn these prayers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  We did learn in the Jewish school, the two years — little over two years that I went through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , the two years — little over two years that I went through school, my brother three years, we did learn Hebrew — ah, the prayers.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  No, I would say 90 percent were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My father was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , very close to the Kurfuirstendamm, which 1s the main shopping center, one block off from there, and it was primarily Jewish businesses or tailors in other <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> in Berlin, very close to the Kurfuirstendamm, which 1s the main <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> , one block off from there, and it was primarily Jewish businesses or tailors in other stores.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  And did you have any non-Jewish friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You said you went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Again, we're talking pre-war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yes, my parents had a number of non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">One of them — here’s the amazing thing, one of them was a midwife to my birth, and she was a high ranking member of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">She had pictures of Hitler and her throughout her entire <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  And how did your father know her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  That, I wish I had an answer, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I don’t know if my father hired her as a midwife, or if my mother did. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But she was the midwife to my birth, may — possibly — my father was a man and ladies’ tailor, he’d sew dresses as well as man suits and maybe he did some clothing for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Her name was Gertrude Noelting, it’s g-e-r-t-u-d-e, which is a pretty common German fir — lady’s first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Yes, Gertrude, and her last name was Noelting, which is — using the American spelling, it’s n- o-e-|-t-i-n-g.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So, how would you describe yourself as a young child? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Were you very independent, or were you more dependent on your parents type of child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well, I would say both. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">At first we, of course, were very dependent on our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But when our father was arrested in 1943, we realized — and I say we, my brother and I — realized what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Well, we already realized what was happening back in 19 — November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Of course, I was not quite six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was born in ’33, January. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And then I realized what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And of course the Germans took my father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They destroyed his inventory. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They destroyed his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Excuse me. [</span><span class="sentence" id="101">coughs] They destroyed everything and then forced us to live, again, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment unit</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">There were — I don’t know how many different levels in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there was, but we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> below the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And that’s what we had and that’s what every other Jewish family had that had two kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They each h-had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , a small <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> 1n each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for every 10 in — in that <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  So much had happened after you were born that you obviously weren’t aware of, being an infant and a — and a toddler and a small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Before Kristallnacht, do you have any memories, or is that your first — do you have any memories of people in uniform, of flags, of anything, or is Kristallnacht your first memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  No, no, I do have memory of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Si -- again, since we lived in the Jewish area, the Hitler youth already, kids 10 years old, there were many a times when we — the kids spit — spit at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were at such an age where we could have — maybe we’re stronger than those kids that spit at us or kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted to hit anybody that had a Hitler youth uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  How did you know that, as a very young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  We were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  By?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  By the Jewish community, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so forth, that the best thing is walk away, otherwise it'll be tougher on us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  So this is something that was discussed openly in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  — by your teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  That 1s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  What about your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Did you talk this over with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  I—I—I wished I had an answer, I do not remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I do not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Now, what about with your brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Were you very close to your brother as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  We were [indecipherable] — oh, my brother and I were very close together and even today we still are very close together even though I live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , but we are very close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  So as two young boys, and I know very young, and you see these frightening situate — or part of these frightening situations, did you talk this over with your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Okay, yes we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Nowadays, even though my brother is a year older, he hardly remembers what transpired. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He just wiped this whole thing out of his memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">If I can say here, last week, of course, was Holocaust Remembrance week. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was asked by the you — army in Fort Lewis, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lewis</span> , Washington, to talk about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors, preferably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ho — su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military, preferably in military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I spent time in the U.S. Army, received a warrant officer commission during my service in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and I t-talked about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I did want my brother to talk about the Holocaust, but — and the reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> , he spent 22 years in the arm — U.S. Army, retired a major, a much higher ranking officer than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But he says he just can’t talk about it, he doesn’t remember it and does not want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he’s [indecipherable] he can’t remember what has happened, yet he’s a year older. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He cannot speak German any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">While he was in the military he was stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> for three years, but never had anything to do with the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  When you were little, in the 30’s, were — did you and your brother talk about what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  No, not that I can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We started talking about it, together with our parents too, after Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And we were told, just try and stay away from Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Don’t get involved, don’t get into arguments. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And of course, in 1941, I think 1t was, when we had to wear the Jewish Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And there were — it’s not just wearing the star, there were limitations made, what — we couldn’t go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> except between five and six o’clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And there were so many restrictions, we couldn't use public transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And my brother and I talked about it, but we knew there was nothing we could do and just hoping that it will get better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  What does a man like Hitler mean to a five year old German Jewish child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I wish I had an answer for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I — I — we knew that he was not good for us, but we always thought it would become better. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And again, we were unique inasmuch our father was an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And our father never thought that he would be arrested and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He figured our family would eventually be given exceptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He just didn’t think it would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And — go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , since your father was American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Only German. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We did not know any English. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">In fact, when my brother and I came to the — the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> after the war, it was only German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Do you know why your father didn’t raise you from birth to be bilingual because he’s — he had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I think he was afraid to teach us English. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Just — actually, my father, even though he was an American citizen, he served in the German army during World War I. And again, that was another reason that he f-felt, like many Jews that was in the German army during World War — World War I, figured that they would not ever be arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And even when my father lost his business, his tailor shop and was moved — a-and we had to go and live in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> and was moved — a-and we had to go and live in this apartment, he had to go into slave labor, but he figured that’s the worst that the Germans will do to him, they forced him into forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And — but still he never thought that he’d ever be arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Describe the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you went to in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  I wished I could, but I do know we had hundred to 150 kids in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And that’s about all I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I do not know the name of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , which I did learn last year when I found the ca — archives in the east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potsdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But other than that I just do not remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  But it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> with Jewish children and Jewish teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  That is correct, but there were way too many kids in a class, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How old were you when you began <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well, I began <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was six years old, in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There was — was some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> almost e-equivalent to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> here, yeah, when I was five years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  So now let’s talk about Kristallnacht, because that was a pivotal point. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">As a five and a half year old, what — what do you remember about that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  I remember it was 1n the middle of the night, which I really think was about four in the morning, when all of a sudden — maybe I should go back a little bit before the actual Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was probably two or three days prior to Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The <span class="DLF">shop windows</span> were just painted with pic — Jude, which means Jew, in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And — well, you couldn’t look out, they were just plain painted with cuss words, so to speak, being a Jew and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  And you were old enough to know what that implied?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I was old enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How did you — how does a young child interpret that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Again, I wished I had an answer and could gi — tell you how my feeling was, but I thought it was terrible that the <span class="DLF">shop windows</span> of my father were all painted. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And then my father was forced to clean and make those <span class="DLF">windows</span> completely clean and it took him all day to have — I think he had two razor blades to scrape all the paint off. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And — but he wer — every other <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> owner, Jewish shop owner in the <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shop</span> owner in the street was forced to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Did you see your father do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Yes, I saw, in fact, I tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We — our — we tried to help him, but very little we could do, especially he only had two razor blades, and he was forced to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it was two days later, after the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were all taken — cleaned, that’s when then they shattered all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And we lived in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and of course we saw what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We were scared, and I knew in my — I still remember my mother’s — my — my mother saying, what are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They’ve took our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> away, they’ve ruined everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I remember my father telling my mother, well don’t worry, that’s what we have insurance for. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We have insurance for vandalism, for theft, and we’ll just have the insurance companies replace everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Of course, that never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I do remember this like it was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Yeah, 1t was — I was five years and 10 month old. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And you kind of grew up quickly and became mature prematurely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Wh — to see Germans in uniform, what is that vision like for a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I—I feared, especially the brown uniforms, which was in the SR, or the SA, or the black uniforms with a skull, which were the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We feared that. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was something that chilled your bodies, at least that’s what it did to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I— I knew what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When I — it goes right back watching the Hitler youth uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">When I see a kid in a Hitler youth uniform, I walked and tried not to be seen by them, especially when — going back to 1941 when we had to wear the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We just shied away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Did you have nightmares of —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Not as a child, but afterwards, and even occasionally when I — I’d—a year ago when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I visited the old <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> , which was Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And I — that evening I had nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">In fact, I was asked to give a taped interview over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They had my record that I was tortured there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And yes, I had some pretty bad <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> — I mean, nightmares.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  So, le-let’s get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Right, Kristallnacht —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So you woke up the next morning, and —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Well, I woke up when they shattered the <span class="DLF">window</span> , just the noise from the <span class="DLF">window</span> shattering and the noises. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And again, you — down Jews, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">A-And you — you don’t deserve to be living here. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I remember that li — again, like I said, like 1t was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you — did you share a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Yes, in fact we only had — actually we had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> my brother and I lived — and these were small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , almost — what you almost have a — like a walk-in closet over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And then my mother and I had another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And we had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and a small —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah, but this was in the first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that you grew up in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Okay, so then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  And then we had to move from that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> into a smaller <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">apartment unit</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment unit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And this 1s where I said we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> per family, plus a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  And your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  He was there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Of course, I wa — remember, this was probably in fi — 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  No, no, no, no, we’re still at — at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Oh, still at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Yeah, let’s go through this —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, there we just [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — chronologically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Okay, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The Kristallnacht we were actually in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">In-Incidentally, that same <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that I remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> is still at the same <span class="NPIP">location</span> , it was not bombed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  So th-the — the <span class="DLF">store windows</span> were broken, your father said insurance would cover it, and then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Then what happened, of course, insurance didn’t cover it, and the Germans gave my father, I think two or three days to move out and they told her that we have to move to this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment unit</span> , which was <span class="BUILDING">Commandant Strasse 63</span> , I remember that address. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And incidentally, when I again visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I tried to look up that old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">apartment unit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Unfortunately it — it was bombed, but the entire block is flat because this — the old <span class="DLF">Berlin wall</span> separating east and west Berlin went right through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So that is no longer in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It’s just an empty <span class="DLF">lot</span> right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  So it was late November, or early December ’38 that you moved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  It was November, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Well, Kristallnacht was November nine and I would say about the 10" or the 11% — 11" or 12 when we had to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Oh, you had to move immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  We had to move immediately, I think the — two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were you able to take everything with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  No, they — they took most of our — everything — most of what we had they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They just scatter it out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We had very, very little to take along. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I think my father had some — he must have suspected something, but some of the material that he made clothing out of, he had someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And he did some sewing for us once we moved in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and he did this late at night, because there — after he was forced to work on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , and — which was slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But at night he would sew some clothing for us so that we had something to wear, because I think everything we owned really, was taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  Did you have any special toys or anything that you were able to take with you, you and your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  No, they were — we had no toys, or — we — we just didn't grow up with toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We — I think my brother and I, I don’t know what we did for play. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I don’t think we played. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We just — we just didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Even before Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Even before Kristallnacht, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We did — I probably should mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We lived pretty — pretty close to a small <span class="DLF">park</span> and so forth, which had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and so forth and I know there was one time when some Hitler youth pushed my brother into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And my brother, of course, did not know how to swim at that time and he almost drowned and some German worker in a bi— on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> saw my brother drowning and he jumped in and saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And of course, he had the Jewish Star on David on my — my brother had that on, but that German still saved him and made sure that my brother was alright and found out where we lived and took my brother actually <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Well, my father then, again had material and sewed him, this man, some clothing and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Well, that poor ma — gentleman was arrested because he saved a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And I do not know whatever happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He was not permitted to talk to us any more, but I do remember that he was arrested for saving a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  Do you know his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  No, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I wished — if I knew his name I would try — would have tried to look him up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  So, you moved out of your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at — a couple days after Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  And then what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Did you still go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  No, I think — yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> through 1942, again to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , and of course there were many, many kids in one class. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And learning, I would say most of my schooling was self studied at our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Yeah, I think probably our mother taught us more how to read than what we learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Did your mother work with your father in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  No, not really, she pretty much took care of us, and again, gave us classes, how to write and read.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  And did anything happen to your extended family on Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Well again, like I say, I had a stepbrother from my mother’s previous er — marr-marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And of course he killed himself the day he was supposed to have been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And we’ve had — but most of our extended family, especially from our mother’s side, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , which is now <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And we had one aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but she too was one of the early ones that was arrested and was in — shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and I do not know if she died over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We lost track. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I’ve done some research on it and I can’t find any record on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And of course all of m — most of my father’s relatives either were — remained in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> or went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">This is tape number one, side B and we’ve already talked about Kristallnacht and your moving into the n — into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Let’s now talk about your father, what he did after his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  It was shortly after Kristallnacht when his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was destroyed, his property taken away and we were forced into living into a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment unit</span> where many, many Jews were forced to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And my father was forced to work on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Rather than being a tailor he was forced to work doing hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It was s — definitely slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And he was actually forced to live there until hi-his arrest in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  So, did he come back at night, or —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, he did come back every night, completely exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I do remember that, as young as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I mean, he could hardly move, but he did come back and he ate what little food my mother had to cook for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Where did your mother get the food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Well, that was another problem a-after the Kristallnacht, when she cou — only had a choice to go to — to <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> by — owned by Jews, between five and six o’clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And — and what I think my mother did, she went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> long before five o’clock so that she would be one of the first in <span class="DLF">line</span> to buy what necessary food products she could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And it was very, very small.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Prior to that, I understand that the Germans forced the Jewish men to take the name in their identification papers of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the mothers — or the women to take the name of Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Did that happen to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Yes, it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Their names became — the middle name was always <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or Sarah and actually, I think even as boys we had — we became <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was one of the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I just vaguely remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Did your — did your parents say anything about that to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  Not really, not really, but yeah, I think every boy was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and every girl was Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Did you have your own papers, or your parents ha-had you on their papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  I do not recall that, I think our parents had the papers, I don’t think we had our own papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Prior to Kristallnacht, there was the anschluss in — in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Did — were you aware of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  No, we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I did not learn this really, until I was older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  Had your parents, or especially your father, ever thought of leaving at this time, or did they make any efforts to try to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Back in 1934, I understand, they did make an effort to leave and we all got as far as <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But — it may have been 1936, we got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> I think, but I think the Germans already were doing a lot of things and even though they haven’t — hadn’t invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> yet, but the — the — they forced my father to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Apparently the — he didn't have the proper papers to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And of course — and he had to pay — every penny he had, he had to pay just to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and he just didn't have the financial resources to get us — to get us back out. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But then again he was so convinced, being an American, that they are going to leave him alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They’ll give him a rough time, but he felt he’d be left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And again, like a lot of people, especially business people were arrested and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , going back to 1941 and 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">My father wasn’t arrested until 1943, and I think there are records here at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , the date he was arrested, even the transport number. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I do not remember now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  But — but you were saying, to go backwards, that in 1936 he was able to get you — the four of you to — to — th-the four of you in family to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  I believe it was 1936, I cannot be sure of the dates, cause again I was too young, I — I know we moved someplace, and — but I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But I know through when I lived with my cousins after I came here to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , they said that he took us all once to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> then had to turn back, but then he ran out of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Now, you’re attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you’re in your new, smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Your father is doing slave labor, your mother is trying to get food and you’re attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with your brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And did you again have any contact with non-Jews then, children your age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Other kids, they wouldn’t — they wouldn’t dare associate with Jews, and it was strictly other Jewish kids that we were in contact with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  Did you play games as a child during this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Were you ab — were the young children able to — I don’t want to use the word disregard, but you know, b-be normal children and play games during this very difficult time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  I do not remember, I do not think we played games. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I just cannot remember that we ever played games. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I think the times were so complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I think in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the teachers concentrated more in group learning and little bit of Hebrew, you know, we studied like the Hebrew alphabet and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  But your lessons were in German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Yes, in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Again, we did learn the Hebrew alphabet, the aleph, bet, gimmel, dalet and so forth, which I still know today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  What did the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> mean to a six, seven year old German child under stress?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  It definitely meant, this is where we’re going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Our father always told us how great the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> are and someday we’re all going to move to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> after the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> will win the w — will prevail and we’re all going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And we were pretty much raised with that mentality, that to live — to go to the United States, it was — we said <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it was — we said America.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  What did it mean to you, what did it represent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  It represented 1— I guess you could say freedom and that it is the best <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world to grow up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  So you continued <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Were you aware — granted, you were seven — you know, young, of what Hitler was doing and invading other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in 1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We were aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  How did you know it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  Well —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you have a radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Yes, we had a radio and we heard it on the radio and we listened to Hitler and his other cronies, and yes, we were fully aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Do you remember his voice on the radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I remember his screaming, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Occasionally, which we weren’t supposed to, I — this is just — as we are talking now, I do remember once in awhile, illegally, we took our S-Star of David off and did attend a movie thea — watched a movie, maybe a comedy or something, that we'd go to a public movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And of course in these movies they also had all this prop — propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And I do remember that now, but I never thought about this until right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  How did you know you’d have to wear a Star of David?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  Oh that — every — I would say even a five year old kid knew that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  How”</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I think it was publicized — told by our parents, and everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We just knew we were inferior citizens and we had to wear that [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you feel inferior?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  We didn’t feel inferior, but we knew to the Germans we were inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And I think it — I probably shouldn’t compare, but I will. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I think it’s the same way when the Afro-Americans at one time had to sit at the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , they had separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">public restrooms</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">public restrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And while I don’t think the average child — black person realized that they were treated as a inferior citizen, but they were treated that way, and this is, I think how we felt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during the war, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  And t-tell me about the yellow star, where you wore it and how it was put on your clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  The yellow star was on our left chest, really, and it was — had to be sewn on, it had to be sewn on neatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And of course our father being a tailor, he did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And we — when we went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> into the <span class="DLF">public streets</span> , we had to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And if you didn’t wear it you were arrested, whether you were a five year old or a 55 year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  What did you feel like wearing a yellow star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  I felt scared, always scared, because I knew that other kids could come, even if they were three year old, or four year olds, they could spit at us, they cou — if they had a stick they could hit us and we couldn’t hit back. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And so yes, I was scared and really afraid to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And again sometimes I think we were blessed, both my brother and I, we did not really look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So sometimes we did take the chance and did not wear the star and did go out and went to a <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Wh-When you say you didn’t look Jewish, can you describe yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  Well, you know, there are certain people, you can tell they’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Oh, you may make a mistake, like even some Egyptians look Jewish, but we were not obvious Jewish looking, otherwise we never would have survived living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Were you fair coloring, and —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, yes, very fair coloring and sometimes people thought my brother is a little darker colored, but he looked more Italian, and in those days <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were still allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  So did you — w-were you ever did — spat upon? </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Did any of the nay —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, we were spat upon many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And like I said earlier, my brother was pushed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , almost — could have drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And we underwent — probably my brother went through Ss — more severe pan — punishments than I was, for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Because he was a year older?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think so, or it’s just where he was at, we weren’t always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And he was — he was mistreated more than I was, I believe, at the beginning of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  And what about your other Jewish friends, other little Jewish boys? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Did you act out any of this or talk this over with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Again, here is a mind that is blank, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I do remember being with other Jewish kids, sometimes walking to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And I don’t think a day went by where we didn’t — weren't — not beat up, bu-but mistreated by the German kids, especially Hitler youth kids and Hitler youth was 10 years and ol — over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Do you get used to this treatment? </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Does a child get used to this treatment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Well, they expect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It’s — I don’t think you ever get used to something like that and I know I never did, but I expected it and it’s just something I knew was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I don’t know how else I can explain that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  And again, did you confide in your — 1n your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And again, I don’t remember what my parents said. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">My mother just said well, those days will pass by, just be patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">These were, I think, what my parents were saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  So you felt your parents were a comfort to you at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Oh, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Our parents did comfort us as much as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  And so then it’s 1941, you’re still at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , your father is doing slave labor —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  — and life goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Any recollection during that year, or even with Pearl Harbor in December, any — the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December and Americans going into the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  No, we — we didn’t know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I did know that Franklin Roosevelt was president. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I do remember this, but I do not remember <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> bombing Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I never even heard of Pearl Harbor, so no, I did not know anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Now, you said this German woman who was your midwife was an acquaintance of your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Was there any relationship with her during this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Had you known about her at this point in your life, in 1940 — 41?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Yes, I did, because there were times, going even back to 1939 where we did visit her at her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And she had a — an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the better part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schoneberg</span> and we did visit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Sometimes she had dinner for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And, in fact there were times th — when she picked us up where we lived and we did remove our Star of David when we had to wear it, and we went with her to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there we were very safe because she also — I think she had a special I.D. or something, that she was a high ranking Nazi member, a personal friend of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So nobody bothered her when — especially when we were with her, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Was she married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  No, she was never married and at that time she was probably in her middle 50’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">She died when she was 79 years old, I believe, a-after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  I’m sure you’re always asked how do you explain the fact that this Nazi party member was so helpful to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Even at that time, and we’ll get to more later, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Okay, when I was younger I couldn’t figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing what has happened, my guess 1s that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler and deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">She used to tell that to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn’t know what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Once he learns what’s going on, he’s going to stop that. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if she would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">A-And I think that’s the only reason that I can think of why she helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And of course she mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And I think that’s the only reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I think I’m the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Did she deli — she did not deliver your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  No, she did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">My brother I think was delivered at a Jewish hospital in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  And how is that you were not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Again, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I— I— I th— somehow either my father or my mother befriended her, and I guess this would have been my mother’s actually third child, me, and I guess she wasn’t as uncomfortable being assisted by a midwife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  So, were you born at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Yes, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">In fact it was — my father ha — actually, he had two <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , one of them was within two blocks of each other and the first <span class="BUILDING">store</span> is where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I think that was in <span class="DLF">Petsalozzi(ph) strasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And then later on Leipne(ph) strasse, which was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  So you would go t-to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and — the four of you a-and visit with her, and fi — through 1941 and did life go on in this difficult way til 1942? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And then what happened in 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  Well, in 1943, one day our father didn’t come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And again, we did have a number of n- non-Jewish friends that were against the Hitler regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And it was one woman that says, leave your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the Germans are arresting everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They took your father away, he’s — he was arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  So that’s how you heard, through this woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  That’s right, who was a friend of ours and she — I think she owned a — a laundry or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But, just outside the Jewish section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And — and she is the one that told us, and it’s — really, it was very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">When we gathered the few things that we owned — as I say we, my mother, my brother and I, the few things we owned, we left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">back entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We went out the <span class="DLF">back entrance</span> and we understand that the SS came up the <span class="DLF">front entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So we just barely escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  How much time elapsed between the time the woman told you and the time you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  Again, I’m guessing here, I would say less than an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was very, very close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  So your father was taken away when he was on the labor battalion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  That is correct, he was, right from work taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And again, from what I see, the record showed he was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and probably — again, talking to Auschwitz survivors, they say normally what happened is when they arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they had two <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> they were tattooed and they were in the work parade, the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> di — were not even — didn’t even get a number, they were put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and my father was one of those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Your father was what, late 40’s, or 50 by then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  I would say he was — I think my father was in the early 50’s at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Well, my father, I — I can probably figure it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I am not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He was born either 1981 or 1991.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Now, you mean 1891.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  Yeah, I mean 18 — 1891, yes, or nin — 1891, I’m not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  So he — so he was 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And again, he was murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , roughly two days after he arrived there from what other people tell me that have been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  So your mother got you two boys together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  And where did she and you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Okay, again we’re going right back to this Nazi midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">She, because of her friendship with Hitler, had a summer cabin in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And only high ranking SS officers could have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And this is where she put us. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">She told all the other officers, military officers, mostly SS, that our father was a — a—TI guess a colonel or something in the army — ar — German army and he was out in the fronts in — in the front line in ka — <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> <span class="DLF">front line</span> in ka — Russia. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And we lived there, right amongst the SS, or the wives of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But then of course wintertime came along —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Well — well now wa — wait a minute, what about papers? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Did you mother — wh-wh-when this happened in the beginning, what kind of papers did your mother have? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">She didn't have these papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  Fraulein Noelting, the midwife, she provided my mother with papers, where we went under different names and us kids went under different names. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And again, she was right up with her party and we ha — there was bombing and a lot of civilians were killed during bomb air raids back in the 40’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And so this midwife, she found out what family with — what mother with two children were killed at a certain — our age, were killed at certain a-a-<span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , or <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And she got us those types of identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And that’s how we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Of course, then after six months or so, people were wondering — sometimes my — maybe I should go — my brother and I would act like we’d go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We’d wear the bags to go as if we were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but we never did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We didn’t dare go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because of every child had to go into physical training and then you take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Well, us being boys, being circumcised would give us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So we never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">But then people got kind of suspicious, they — nobody ever saw us in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So this midwife says, you have to leave from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And then again we took on different I.D. and we moved from <span class="REGION">area</span> <span class="NPIP">area</span> to <span class="REGION">area</span> , <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Some of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> I do not know, but I —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So the first <span class="NPIP">location</span> you stayed for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">What was your new identification, who were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  I was — it so happened I was Horst Grossman. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">My mother was a Grossman, I don’t know what her first name was, and my brother was a Grossman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  These were German, not Jewish Grossmans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  These were German named people that were killed during an air raid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  She obviously felt very positive towards Jews then, she had no negative feelings towards Jews, or — or were — or did she and you were just special cases?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  I believe we were special cases because she used to complain about Jews, they all have so much money and they are ruining the economy of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I used to hear her say things like that, even to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And yet she said, but our family was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">She was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Well, when — after the war, when only my brother and I survived, she was real upset when we told her we’re going to try and go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And she was very upset because she says, you are Germans, you can’t leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And when my brother and I did leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we wrote to her once we got to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , she would never answer us, she was so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She said we don’t show any thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  What would you two boys do during the time the Jew — the German children were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="528">What would you do, you’d take your schoolbags and what would you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  What we did, we — this was out in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> type of an <span class="REGION">area</span> and we would just walk inside the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">In fact, we would pick mushrooms, this is what we ate all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My brother and I and our mother too, we got to know every edible mushroom. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And instead of going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we would pick mushrooms, so that’s what we had to eat most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  What did your mother do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Oh, I think she — she stayed at the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> and she washed clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I think she did wash clothing fo — wash and did other things for some other people to get some income.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  On — in your free time, or when the German children were not in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you play with them, did you talk with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I think we did, but I can’t be sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">There are so many blanks that I can’t really tell you for sure if we did or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I think we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I do know — one thing I do remember, during the — there was a vacation period about four weeks or so and there was one kid —a German kid, not Jewish, who drove — he was 15 years old and he drove a milk delivery vehicle, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorized vehicle</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">milk delivery vehicle</span> , it was a motorized vehicle. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I — I helped him deliver the milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And he was pretty much a real Nazi believer, Hitler youth, but somehow he — he befriended me, and we became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Of course, I didn’t tell him who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I know there was a time where I helped him deliver the fresh milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  What’s it like — what was it like to see a swastika?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  Fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Just plain fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Of course you saw it, no matter where you went you saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And the swastika was actually easier to get used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The thing that bothered me was the — the skull that the SS had on, or even some soldiers that were affiliated with the SS all wore that — that skull. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">That was, to me, worse than the swastika.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Well, because I knew that were the ones that would kill the Jews — they would kill us, and we knew that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Were you ever afraid when you were with these young German boys that you would let your guard down and say something that was inappropriate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  No, again we were mature enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We never were — feared that because we knew we would not let our guard down. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And that includes my brother too. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We knew what to say and what not to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  Even — even at such a young age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Yes, yes we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And we also knew that we were not to expose ourselves in a <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> or so forth, because we knew if we did we would be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">This is tape number two, side A. Just exactly wa-was this <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> — where was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span> located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Okay, it was east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berger Uplager(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And again, to get there you had to actually walk, probably worth a 20 or 30 minute walk from the train station, and right in the midst of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and right in the midst of a forest. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And that was the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , Berger Uplager(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  What was the atmosphere like there among the — the SS families, the women and the children, what is — was it a joyous atmosphere, a relaxed atmosphere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  Very joyous and a relaxed atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Again, these were all, like I said earlier, SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They had the food, they had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And you didn’t think there was a war going on, to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Did the SS people come to visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t, because again they knew to — as far as they knew, our father was in the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and — and my mother always showed like she was so sad, she didn't know where Father was exactly, that they pretty much left her alone, as far as I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And we didn't mix too much with the — and most of them didn’t even have kids there, and — because again they were probably, most of the people there were in their late 30’s, early 40’s and they had kids who are — probably were in se — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , I almost said. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They were probably in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> taking training in the Hitler youth, because they were all Hitler youth age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  So you really didn’t talk to the adults?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I cannot really remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I’m sure we did, but again there’s so many blanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I’m sure we did but I can’t — I just cannot remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  And you did not know at that time what happened to your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  No, we knew he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because he wrote, right after he was arrested he wrote a postcard and said that he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , things are going fine and will see you all when I get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And that’s the — and this postcard was written to this midwife and she was a little concerned that they would watch her because she got a letter from a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But again, with her affiliation with the SS and with Hitler, they never did anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  What did she do — what did she do, this woman, Frau Noe-Noelting, as a job? </span><span class="sentence" id="587">As work, as an occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I know she was a midwife, is that what she continued to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  Yes, she continued being a midwife and she brought a lot of kids into this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  But as a member of a Nazi party — of the — of the Nazi party, did she have any specific duties? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Or she was just a good Nazi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  She was just a good friend of Hitler and some of the other people, but she did not like Himmler, Goering or Goebbels. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">She said they’re — those are the people that are at fault what is being done to the Jews, and as soon as Hitler knows about it, it’1l stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">In the meantime, she did her job as a midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I do remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Did she ever see Hitler during the time that you were with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  I don’t believe she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">She tried to, but he was so busy that he just didn’t have time to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But I do know she has made attempts to talk with Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  How did she get this connection, was it through her family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I do not know how she and Hitler became friends, but like I said earlier, there were pictures of her and Hitler together, even Hitler had her — his arm around her in pictures of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">How they became friends, I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  So then you left this first <span class="NPIP">location</span> because she told you it wasn’t safe to stay and then where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Again, sa — I — we lived in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But then even that got a little bad —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  To the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We went back to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But then — things got bad, but again this midwife found another family that was wiped out, by the name of Schmitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And it so happened this woman had children, two boys, almost our age and they wi — they looked a li — somewhat like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So we actually took their I.D., pictures of them, and we moved to a reso-sort area in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binz</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binz auf Rugen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It’s a eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my mother had a job there as a — as a maid at one of the — at a big <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> again, where soldiers took their own rest and recuperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And she was — my mother became a maid over there, and had an income. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But again, after about four months we had to move, because again, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We didn't dare go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">In fact there was a time where all the German kids had to work out on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and pick vegetables and things, so there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And so my brother and I were out there with the other German kids, boys and girls, pulling vegetables and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But then it got — <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started and we had to move because we didn’t dare go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And so we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , again this midwife, she mailed — via mail she sent us the proper documents that we needed in case there’s an I.D. check. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But at that time we almost has the proper I.D. for Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But we were lucky that there was no I.D. check on our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binz</span> auf Raden(ph) on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , because we would have been caught of the — it was very, very, very scary when we went in public transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But we ended up back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I think we kept that identification until the end of the war, the — by the name of Schmitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I don’t remember what first name we had, but again we moved from <span class="REGION">area</span> to <span class="REGION">area</span> and then, I don’t know where now, in 1945, let’s say —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Well, le-let’s wait a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Did you have any kind of a shorthand communications wi — communication system with your brother, so if you were out together and there was a problem, you could kind of signal him? </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Do you know what I’m saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So you wouldn’t have to talk, but you could — either with your eyes, or ar — in — anyway — or hands, or with your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Any — do you know what I’m saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Any kind of back-up protection if things got really bad and you really couldn’t say it openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yes, we had some notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">For instance, if we — if one of us, my mother, brother or I noticed something that could be a possible Gestapo checking for I.D., if we thought it was, we’d make some hand notes and we slowly in di — different pe — not together, we’d disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Because some there, sometimes you could almost guess it. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">We got so we could feel that that was a Gestapo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  So you had hand motions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Yeah, we had the hand motions and then we’d me — le-leave one at a time, and we wouldn’t ha — never go into a <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> , because they — they caught a lot of il — so full — so-called illegal people in <span class="INT_SPACE">restrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And so we usually stayed out and tried to move away within two or three blocks from where we were at, then we’d get back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Yes, we — we did have that, just like we always had a meeting place if we got separated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  Wherever you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Was this — did this change day by day”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Not day by day but maybe every third day we’d say, well, if we get separated, let’s meet at this train station, or lets meet at this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , or lets meet at this building. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We always decided on a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  So you — well then what — again, what did you and your brother do during the day while the other children were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You — you are 11 and he’s 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  [sneezes] Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Yeah, again, I d— I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I just don’t know what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">We’d walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Of course now you know you had air raids almost daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">The U.S. used to bomb daytime, the British bombed at night and we spend a lot of time in <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Especially when we’re g — now going to 1944, a lot of our time was spent in <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  No, we never did go to a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and of course <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> were not available. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But we — we did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Why didn't you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to show you’re a good Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  We —I don’t think we were at <span class="NPIP">places</span> long enough, but for some reason we never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Again, our mother must have had a reason not to go to a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  Di-Did she always provide enough food for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  Well, she tried to, but there were times — there were times where we didn’t have anything to eat for two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">The — probably where we had most of the food where we did not starve was that short time that we lived in that summer cabin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and also when we were in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">summer cabin</span> in Berlin and also when we were in that hotel, this <span class="BUILDING">resort hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binz auf Rigen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">There was had ample food. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Again, I think my mother took it from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> at times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  When you walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , were you aware that there were other Jews on the <span class="DLF">street</span> who were hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Did you sense other Jews being nearby who were under false papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  No, could not tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">We did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I’m sure there were and they probably didn’t know we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">No, I ba — I believe that the — the Jews that were living like we were, under false — assumed names and so forth, did not know anyone else that was in hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  Di— had she delivered any other Jewish babies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  I do not know, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I think I was probably the only one that she had delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  Did you know if she sheltered other Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Definitely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I know we were the only ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  How do you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">ANSWER:  She’d say that, she’d tell my mother that. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">She said, you are the only ones I am helping and I know that if Hitler catches me, he’ll free me and everything will be by — will be forgiven and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> would be eliminated once Hitler knew about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  Did she tell any of her family or her friends about you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  She had an adopted daughter, and she’s the only one that knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And her daughter was in the photography business and I think she developed things against — for the — for the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Pictures that were taken an that were maybe tough to — to really make a good picture out of, she was able to i-improve the — the pictures of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I mean, you know, photography was still not too good at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">In fact, she would even color them if they wanted colored pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">She would actually manually color the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And, but again, she kept her mouth shut, and she was the only one that knew that we were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  And what was her name and did you have contact with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Yes, m—1n fact, my brother saw — visited her when he was stationed in the army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  So, did you stay in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> once you were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , or did you move around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  We moved around all the time and until the beginni — beginning of 1945 when we lived in different <span class="BUILDING">subway stations</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Why weren’t you in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  Well, it got so that we didn’t know where to go any more and the bombing was ak — like I said earlier, day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelters</span> were overcrowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We couldn’t get in, and to be in a <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> again as kids, had to be in Hitler youth uniform, which we didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And we were afraid to be caught in a bomb shelter, so we stayed in subway stations, which a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, because the subway stations were pretty deep down and they were probably one of the safest <span class="NPIP">places</span> <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> , so we stayed in <span class="BUILDING">subway stations</span> , which a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, because the <span class="BUILDING">subway stations</span> were pretty deep down and they were probably one of the safest places to be until bef — the day before the Russians came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  Did people question you on the <span class="DLF">street</span> why you weren't in a Hitler youth uniform? </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Did anybody ever ask you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  Only once I can remember where I was asked, why aren’t you in uniform, I’d say it’s being cleaned. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And that’s the only time I was ever asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  So what did you do during the day?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  What was your mother’s state of mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  She too thought that he would be freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">She definitely did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  Was she calm during this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">What — how would you describe this woman?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Then she had no contact with any other Jews as far as you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  As far as I know, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I know there was a — another person, not Jewish, who helped us out quite a bit, he was a doctor and also analyzed x-rays and so forth, he had a x-ray business. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And he — he was an M.D. and I think the was partly the underground, because th — he was arrested at the tail end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And I know he 1s the one that gave my mother quite a bit of information, and where we can stay and where we could not stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">But other than that, my wa — mother didn’t have too much contact with anyone else.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Well again, we were kids and we’d just go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and lie down on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">It was very cold at times, but you got used to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  Did you feel very old going through these terrifying experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Well, let’s put it this way, I did not feel like a 10 - 11 or 12 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">We grew up, we matured very, very early in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And yes, I see other — I would see other 10 year old and I see how — what a child they were and I say, they must be a lot younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I do recall that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  Did you feel very German then, or very Jewish, or both?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Sometimes I felt German. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I had to feel German in order to save myself, but I — deep <span class="NPIP">inside</span> I felt Jewish, yes, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  Were you angry then that you were Jewish and so you had to go through all these terrible — this terrible ordeal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  No, I was not angry, I was just wishing why can’t we be like anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I was not angry being Jewish, no, but I just was wishing I could be — that this discrimination against the Jews wouldn’t be, that it would stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And why am I different than any other German kid? </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I— maybe I regretted it, but I was not angry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  And — and then what? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So you — you — as I said, you were living in the <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> until?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  Until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Actually, what happened is we were at one <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> , and all of a sudden it started being flooded, water came gushing through there. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And all the people that were at that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> started moving — the s-subways were not running — on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> to another <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And very few of us had anything to eat or to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Some people started drinking the water that was stuving — coming through, and most of those people actually died due to diseases, I think typhoid or whatever it brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it, and we kind of kept each other from drinking it. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">We knew that that is dirty, we’re not going to drink it. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , which was not flooded then. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And we probably spent — and my — our mother was still alive then, and — who kind of kept us, too, from drinking it. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And we got to the other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> that was not flooded, and — but we needed water, and so my mother went outside the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> upstairs to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire hydrant</span> to get water. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And she didn't come back down. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire hydrant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And actually she was killed, I don’t know if it was German or Russians, but the crossfire between the Russians and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And so — and I never could get the water, I was forced to go back down into the <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> by German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I was a kid, and he forced me to go back down. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> with Tommy guns — machine guns in each hand and everyone — everyone down in that <span class="DLF">subway tunnel</span> started clapping. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">There were a few German soldiers there, they threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And again, this was at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no longer a subway station, but the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> <span class="BUILDING">Anhalter Bahnhof</span> , which is no longer a <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> , but the station is still there as a — a memorial, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And that was the end of the war for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And we then —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Let — let — let’s go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I’m sure it’s painful, but you come upstairs and you see your mother —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  It was very [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  —an-and how did you break the news to your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Okay, at the time I didn’t know if she really was dead or just injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And I told my brother I saw our mother, she was up at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire hydrant</span> , but the Germans wouldn’t let me get to it, and I think she is okay, but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That’s really what I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And I didn’t know, I — it was just the way I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And of course we never did see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And, in fact, up to this day, I do not know if she was killed or injured because the Russians took a lot of — especially women and children, they loaded them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and s-shipped them to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , especially women. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">In fact, after the war my brother and I were loaded onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> many times to be — to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but we knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> like a book, we — there wasn’t an address we couldn’t find. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And we, for awhile were guides to some of the Russian officers going from point A to point B.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Previous to you losing your mother, were di — di — wasn’t there a situation where you were taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We didn’t — we didn’t cover that. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under false I.D., and again in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> , and I was there by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I think I may have been on my way to this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And we’d do that, sometimes my brother went to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And this was on April 15", 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I was caught in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And the reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And they had an I.D. check and I had the I.D., I was — I don’t remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So again, they make you drop the pants and they knew pretty much if you didn’t have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And of course, to a 12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they — I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They tied me up, my hands behind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">That was the <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And they had a kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , like a <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> where they questioned people, not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were tortured at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And again, according to the archives — the archives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> do not s- say what happened to me when I was arrested April 15". </span><span class="sentence" id="800">It only showed that on April 17", I was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> on a t — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Well, for t— two days there, between the 15" and the 17", I was tortured, but they didn’t get any information out of me because they beat me and things they did, pulling teeth out, I have dentures. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or anything, and usually I’d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And that was April 17, according to the archives. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And I ended up, after two days roughly, 1-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , which I believe was the only concentration camp that still was open and there with a route between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that still was open and there with a route between Berlin and Munich. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I never left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , railcar that I was in was mostly — were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Then there were a whole bunch of people on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I don’t know how long they save, you know, kept the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> until it was full, completely full. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So there were a number of people that I know were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And it was — it was the worst <span class="NPIP">hell</span> I’ve ever been in. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And it was either April 19" or April 20", I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Again, during th — fr — apar — from the records that were kept, I turned up missing April 20". </span><span class="sentence" id="816">It may have been th-the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But during and air raid, there was an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> that we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Why, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I kind of think is that the German guards — they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was liberated April 29". </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And this was let’s — let’s say this was April 20". </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the <span class="DLF">railcar door</span> figured maybe they’d get better treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And so that <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn’t too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We ended up on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They were not SS, they were German soldiers, and they were teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a rifle because at that time now they made everybody defend the Motherland — the Fatherland. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And anyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn’t have no weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">But in groups they just attacked the Germans, and like I say, over half were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">This is tape number two, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar — overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though they had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">They just looked in awe, and the Russians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And then they started to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of one of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And I followed the railroad tracks, because I knew there were old <span class="DLF">Autobahn</span> , the <span class="DLF">freeway</span> — not — not <span class="DLF">freeway</span> , <span class="DLF">highway</span> <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , because I knew there were old Autobahn, the freeway — not — not freeway, highway, was right next to the railara — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And so I walked towards there and I decided to flag down a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that went by was a German SS car, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German SS car</span> , a Mercedes and two SS officers were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Well, they stopped, and I said I’m — I need to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I was at this camp here and Russians came by and they killed everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I’m the only one that is left aline, and I want — a- alive, I want to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and meet — and go to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And they said come on in, jump in, we have a message for Hitler, that’s where we’re going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Now remember, I didn’t — the only language I knew was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I talked like a German, I was German, except they didn't know I was a German Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">There were numerous <span class="DLF">roadblocks</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , however, we were waived through every <span class="DLF">roadblock</span> because they were again — I don’t know what rank they were, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the <span class="DLF">windshield</span> , and they hardly even ever slowed down for a <span class="DLF">roadblock</span> , 1t was opened up for them to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And they dropped me off at <span class="BUILDING">Anhalter Bahnhof</span> , which was — actually, that was our meeting place where we always said if we get separated, this is where we meet, and — and every day we’d go and meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Well, we got to — I got to <span class="BUILDING">Anhalter Bahnhof</span> and there was my mother and brother who almost fainted when they saw me in the Hitler youth uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But anyhow, this was — you see, it’s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the midwife, we went to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I did change clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I didn’t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take me like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So I didn’t want to be in the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we were injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that’s really how we lived until the Russians came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  How do you explain how you kept your equilibrium through all of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="851">You were so young, you were 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Let’s even go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Well, no, let’s even go back previous to that, to how you were tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Ho-ho — you were 12 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Well, they were so animal-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">They had, like I say, after some pain, I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And by the time — I was never — why I didn’t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Another thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I mean when — after the war, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn’t much heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn’t recognize tha — how thin I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I probably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn’t see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I think their whole thing was to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to let Hitler — probably what I think happened is because they knew the allies were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , probably to ask Hitler what should be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They could have been general officers, I’m — I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But, I mean, we practically flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I mean, they drove that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> as fast as it could be driven and of course they’re — the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> you saw on the <span class="DLF">Autobahn</span> were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicles</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  And then when you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> , was that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  It was a cattle car, and this is why even today, right here at this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I — I’ve been here four or five times, I have never been able to step foot in that cattle car that is right here at this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , and this is why even today, right here at this museum, I — I’ve been here four or five times, I have never been able to step foot in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> that is right here at this museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  How do you explain your keeping your composure, your sanity in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> like that, when you were — when you were going through it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  Well, I knew I was going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I knew my — that s — that I was caught, they’re taking me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I didn’t know which one and I knew the end of my life was near. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And I accepted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And of course my brother and my mother, we all knew that we are living from day to day and it could be at any time we could be arrested and put to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I mean, we knew our father went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Even though we thought, again, him being an American, he will survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">QUESTION:  Did you know what a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, we knew and we knew they were gassing Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  How did you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER:  It spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I believe the — this midwife told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">But we knew, and th-the word spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">The Germans knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Of course they said they didn’t know, and now they all say they never knew, which 1s a lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">They all knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And of course the way they beat people up into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcars</span> , I mean, not only Jews, also Jehovah Witness was one, gay people and of course Poles or other foreigners that were enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And they were just beaten, literally beaten up into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcars</span> and squeezed together like cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Did the older people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> help you, as a 12 year old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  No, I would say the Russian soldiers helped me and actually kept me from getting down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , because they knew if I would fall, I wou — could be dead, because I’d be trampled on. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And I will say the Russian — incidentally, they treated me well, and treated my brother well after they liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  But in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  I-In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> they treated me very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They kept me up and made sure that I stand up and don’t try to lie down. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And especially, I mean I — sleepy. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">You know, I was there at least two days, nothing to eat, nothing to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">But they kept me from lying down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">QUESTION:  Was it dark?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">There were — there was some light coming in daytime, but very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And with all the people stacked in, it was mostly dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And it was still — well again, we were so close together. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">That’s one good thing, otherwise we would have been freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I mean April in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> still gets — the nights get very cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  Was it all men, or was it men and women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  Men and women, men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And it was very unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">There are things that — well, I was young enough really, I didn’t know about a woman having a period. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I didn’t know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Of course, that transpired there. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And a lot of people had diarrhea, and again, no sanitation facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And it’s — that’s what went on there and I’m not the only one that suffered like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And — but again, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> was probably as wor — as bad as having been tortured, because in the torture, so much of it, I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And though I woke up with pain, but still, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> was the worst thing that could have any — happened to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  Besides the Russian soldiers being of help to you, did you sense that people were helping others? </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Other people were helping —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  You mean in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  — other victims in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  No, I think — I think most of them were in there much longer and were too weak to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I think the Russian soldiers that helped me and were helpful, I think were c-caught on the eastern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which the Russian came in on. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I think they were caught shortly — about the same time I was, or maybe it — two or three days sooner. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But of course they were not tortured, they were just loaded on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> til 1t was completely full. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">But I don’t think they were in too long and were still strong enough to survive this ordeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  What does death mean to a 12 year old? </span><span class="sentence" id="921">You said you knew you were going to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  It meant strictly, that’s it, you’re going to be — you’re going to be away from this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">It’s — to me, I knew death. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Of course, remember, I saw my stepbrother kill himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And I knew he was dead, he would never be alive again. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And that’s really what it meant to me, I’Il be just like Klaus, my s-stepbrother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  Were you afraid of death?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  No, that’s the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">My brother, and I think this 1s probably why he can’t remember anything, he feared death, he — he feared the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">We sometimes had to hold him or he would run right into the fire, practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">He feared death and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I just took it one day at a time and always took it, and I guess I still feel like that today. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I mean, I spent time in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and I just felt like, when the time comes, I — I’Il die. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And I thought my time was there when I was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , especially with all the dead people around me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  When you got back to your mother and your brother after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> , did you tell them what you went through, and the tortures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  Yes, I told them where I was at, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And of course, my mother just cried and hugged me and so thankful that I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And she suspected that 1s what had happened, because we had never been separated more than a — a day, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">No, I think one time, my mother couldn’t come back and she was gone for one night, but then we got together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But other than that we’ve always spent the nights together, wherever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  You were very, very quick thinking and quick witted to put on that Hitler youth uniform and flag down that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">What do you attribute that to? </span><span class="sentence" id="943">That was a very brilliant decision, and you were 12 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">ANSWER:  Well — that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Well, I think my brother would have done the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Again, maybe our mother brainwashed us in there — in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us whenever things like happen, what to do, I — I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially when I couldn’t follow the Russians and here I was all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And — and I decided, well, the only way I’m going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn’t be forced to take a rifle and start shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And again, I didn’t know like, at the time that the allies were out or the — outside the Dachau camp that the ger — Russians were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau camp</span> that the ger — Russians were outside, I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">We knew it was the end of the war coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Well, we knew that and th-the word spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">People, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And I used to hear people say, look at all those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> there — to other people — look at those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , there’s not enough gasoline to operate the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , they’re out of gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And so the Germans weren’t quite as afraid any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But of course afterwards, and I — I do know women, I know men that would say, oh we’re — we have a secret weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">This just when the Russians were really fighting for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they’re going to kill the — all the Russians that are coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">There were still those fanatics around and I heard women say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I’m going to pour boiling water on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And Pll do everything, they’ll never get me, I'll kill them, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Of course, after the Russians came in, oh how sweet you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And — and honestly, the Russians would wa — rape the women right out in daylight in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Again, things I didn’t know until 1t came true. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And you know, I had no remorse on those women that used to — I used to hear in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> that they are going to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they’re gonna put boiling waters on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">That’s how they felt then, and then they were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">So, the Russians that came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> were completely uneducated. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">They had no common sense, and they were — in fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian — I think the front line soldiers were maybe from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , or people that were politically arrested or other — some reason other arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And they were — they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they treated us well. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And of — of course after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was divided between the Russians, the French, the British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  When — so you — le-let’s get back just chronologically, you — you — the ra — you found your mother, you saw that your mother had been shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  You came downstairs, you told your brother and then the Russian soldiers came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  What happened, we went to the Russian soldiers and we found somebody that spoke German —no, we even found a Jewish soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We found a Russian Jewish soldier who spook — spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And so we communicated in Yiddish and said we were hungry and we told them we were Yiddish, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And they gave us food, they gave us water. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">They actually nourished us back a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">QUESTION:  Did you feel liberated at that moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">ANSWER:  Yes, we felt liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">QUESTION:  And what did that mean to you boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">ANSWER:  Freedom, food. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We can talk freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">We don’t have to worry about being arrested by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We don’t have to worry about being beaten or spit upon by other German kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">That’s what it meant, it just meant full freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And — and after we received food and everything from the Russians, we then — this Russian soldier, I don’t know what his rank was, or what, but he was — this Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated and we became the guide to his officer, and showed him where to go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> from point A to point B, because we knew it so well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">QUESTION:  Wher-Where were you living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">ANSWER:  We were still living with the Russians, very close to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anhalter Bahnhof</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> where our mother was killed, we think. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">In fact, this soldier wa — by the time we went back outside the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , our mother was not — there was nobody by this fire hydrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And that Jewish soldier did try to find our mother, but couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">So we do not know if she was taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or buried, or what.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  And you s — you still expected to find your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But then after — after the division between the Russians, the — and the Americans when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was divided up in sectors, and then we went to live with that midwife, we knew that — that — we found out that the people that were in concentration camp by that time would have been back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by that time would have been back in Berlin or we would have known and our father would have known to get in touch with this midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And when he didn't — and the same thing with our mother — we knew our mother — again, we didn't know, and of course, I still don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Even today I don’t know if our mother died in this crossfire or if she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , because the Russians did take thousands of — of kids and women to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I’m sure you are aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And so that, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">We did, before we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , we had to identify our mother, and we had to get a birth ad —-a—a-— a death certificate of our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And we said well, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Well, if you want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you need to have a death certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">So there were a whole bunch of people and so we just identified yes, that was our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">They showed us pictures of several people, I said yes, that’s our mother, so we could get a death certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But if she really died there, we don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION:  You stayed with the Russian soldiers —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  For a—</p>
<p>QUESTION:  For how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Well, I—I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">There must be records. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">When — when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was divided into the four <span class="REGION">sectors</span> , it was until the division, we stayed with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">One thing is, we were their guide, but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> didn’t run and things like this, until the division really, and wa — there was no way we could have gotten to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schoneberg</span> to the — to the midwife, and we didn’t even know if she was still alive or — or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But it was after the di-division that we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schoneberg</span> , to the midwife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">QUESTION:  Before that did you meet with people — meet people who had also been in hiding, other Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Well, you saw the picture of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but no that was — no, I didn’t, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">QUESTION:  I-I meant in the very beginning, after liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">ANSWER:  At the very beginning no, we did not meet anyone that was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">No, I’m co — incorrect there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I know of about two or three people that also received this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I.D. that were not in hiding, that were out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , because the Russian government, or the Russian military produced these I.D.’s that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> very close to where I was at at that <span class="BUILDING">Anhalter Bahnhof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And I — I did meet two or three people, elderly people that did get out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and also received this I.D. But as far as people that were living in hiding, at that time no, I ha — did not meet anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  So then you — you went back to this woman —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">QUESTION:  -- the — the midwife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">ANSWER:  To the midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And of course — she actually signed us up, we did go to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> there after the war for a little bit, but not very long, about two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">QUESTION:  She was willing to take you back in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">ANSWER:  Yes, she took us back in and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you assume your old names, your real names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">ANSWER:  Yes, we — we assumed our real name and she even provided clothing for us because we wore practically rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But we weren’t the only Germans that wore rags, you couldn’t buy clothing during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But anyhow, she got us some clothing and signed us up to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And I think she started me in the second grade and my brother in the third grade in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">But we only went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about a month or two, and then the British military, they inherited what used to be a—a rest and cu — recuperation camp outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , about three or four hours drive out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luneburg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">recuperation camp</span> outside of Berlin, about three or four hours drive out of Berlin in Luneburg, and where the Germans had a rest and recuperation camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And they took a bunch of — at that time now, kids that were either in hiding or in concentration camp, they looked those people up, including my brother and I, and in British ambulances they drove us to this former [indecipherable] camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luneburg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , they looked those people up, including my brother and I, and in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British ambulances</span> they drove us to this former [indecipherable] camp in Luneburg, where we were nursed — we were given complete physical examinations and we were nursed back into health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And that is straight — before we went to that camp, my brother and I then got to know some of the Jewish American soldiers who opened up the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and this one, Werner Nathan was his name, a private in the U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually was responsible in opening up that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> at Rosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got the Joint Distribution Committee 1n touch with us, who sponsored us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> my brother and I then got to know some of the Jewish American soldiers who opened up the synagogue, and this one, Werner Nathan was his name, a private in the U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually was responsible in opening up that synagogue at Rosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got the Joint Distribution Committee 1n touch with us, who sponsored us to come to the States. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Well, trying to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And while we were waiting to co-come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , we went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rest camp</span> that the British sponsored, that should have been for, I think eight weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">For two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Well, we were there about three months when a American soldier, not Werner Nathan, some other American soldier came, looked for us and says we are going to be coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">We have our — our visas and we’re going to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> So we left that camp early, went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he drove us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I don’t know if it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">private vehicle</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp early,</span> went back to Berlin and he drove us back to Berlin and I don’t know if it was a private vehicle or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U.S. Army vehicle</span> , I don’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">QUESTION:  When you were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rest camp</span> , there were other Jewish children, did you talk and compare stories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Nobody wanted to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">They didn’t really want to talk about it, including me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">We just survived, and some of them were living in conditions like — you know, maybe in a <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> someplace and never saw daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Or somehow that they had — maybe people hid them, and really hid them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And mo — and lot of the kids I know were in — out in <span class="DLF">farms</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And — but again, lived in hiding where nobody knew that they were in that — a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And — but nobody really wanted to talk about it too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">QUESTION:  What do you attribute that to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">ANSWER:  I don’t think — even me at the time, I was still thinking, is this real? </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Am I really free? </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And yeah — and nobody asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">I may mention something here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Two years ago I met a woman, she too was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rest camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We met each other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> at the Child Survivors of the Holocaust conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And — but if — we just didn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> after they rescue — recuperating, and my brother and I, and we told the midwife, Frau Noelting that we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And oh, she was upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">She says, you’re German, you can’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">But we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">QUESTION:  T-Tell me more in detail how you met Werner Nathan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  After the — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was divided, again our father being an American and being pretty much told that we’re going to come to — go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> some day, we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U.S. Army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And where we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schoneberg</span> was the w — <span class="REGION">American sector</span> , fortunately enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And so we just went to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> and we started telling at the front gate really, 1s there anybody here that speaks German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And most of them don’t, you know, and — and says yes, and they called this one private out, which was Werner Nathan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">He is ori — was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and they went to the States before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">If he is alive he’d be in his 80’s now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And anyhow, we talked with him — and he was very Orthodox, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And he says, well he’s in the process of finding a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and they found a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the only <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> that was not burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And that he was opening up that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And that’s really how we met him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">QUESTION:  So he stayed in contact with you from that day on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And he 1s the one that contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">QUESTION:  Did you go to the Rosh Hashanah services?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">This is a picture, and here is my brother and I at the Rosh Hashanah services right here in this picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">QUESTION:  What were your thoughts during that service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">ANSWER:  Thanking God that we are alive, and — and afterwards this so — Werner Nathan forced us to study a little bit more Hebrew, and the various prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And I think it was a month or two later that we — maybe not even that long, I don’t know exactly, is when we became Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">My brother and I were the first two Jewish boys Bar Mitzvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">This is tape number three, side A, and you had begun to talk about preparing for your Bar Mitzvah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">ANSWER:  Right, well, having been away from really, the Jewish religion for all these war years, we were taught by this American serviceman, who was very Orthodox, and he probably knew as much as a rabbi, and he made sure that we learned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And even though I was only 12 years old and my brother were 13, he recruited one of the Jewish chaplains fr — chaplains from his American company in the army and we were officially Bar Mitzvah, went through all the various prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And I do not know the exactly — exact date, but I would say it was some time in 1946 and probably I would — I’m guessing now, between March and April of 1946 when we were Bar Mitzvah, becau —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So you were already 13, cause you were 13 in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1084">ANSWER:  Ah, no I wa — that’s correct, I was 13 in January, so I was th — that’s right, I was 13 and my brother was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And of course, he was a year late before he could be Bar Mitzvah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">QUESTION:  Did you want to have a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">ANSWER:  Yes, we’ve always wanted to be Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I mean, even though we were never very religious, we were very conservative, but 1t was always our parents saying that when — I remember always saying when my brother becomes 13 years old he’s going to be a man, he’s going to be Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And the same thing was true with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And yes, I did want to be Bar Mitzvah and we were very proud when we became Bar Mitzvah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">QUESTION:  Can you describe what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">ANSWER:  No, that I do not remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I do not remember, but I know there was a big party afterwards, at that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and it was a — a day of celebration, but what we did, I do not remember, but it was probably the most enjoyable time in our lives, from the day I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">QUESTION:  Who came to the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">ANSWER:  A lot of Jewish, as well — Jewish U.S. soldiers, Russian soldiers and I’m not sure but I — something in my back of the mind, I— I’m sure that the midwife’s stepdaughter, who was a photographer, I believe she took pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I do not have any of those pictures, but I b — do believe she was there taking pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And that’s all I can really remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  Was it difficult not having your parents there at your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">ANSWER:  Of course it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">We missed our mother, we wished our father could have been there even though we knew the fact that he was dead and perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And so we — but we did miss our mother and again in — in th — at that time we still were not sure, we did not know whether she was still alive, or — or dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">We didn’t know that, so yes, it was very, very hard not having our mother there, though we celebrated, it was joyous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">But we still wished that our mother could have been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1104">QUESTION:  Were you trying to locate your mother still, at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">ANSWER:  Oh yes, all the time, we — whenever we learned of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that had records, and regardless what section, whether it — whether it was French, British or what, we’d go over there and see if we could find anything on our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">But we, of course, never found anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  Did Gertrude Noelting come to your Bar Mitzvah, or just her daughter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  I do not recall her coming, but I — I’m not 100 percent sure if her daughter came, but I — I really believe she did come and took fi — pictures, but I’m almost positive that Frau Noelting never did come to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  So d- and you had the celebration at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">ANSWER:  That is correct, they had a big celebration that we had food, and we had fruits that we haven’t — had never seen, like a banana. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">We almost didn’t know how to peel a banana and I believe we had banana the first time since the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I do remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">QUESTION:  And your relationship with your brother then, did it — it was still as intensely close as it had been during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">ANSWER:  Oh, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">We’ve been very close, even though after we got older and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , just like brothers one year apart used to fight and argue, which we did, too, but still we were very close and even today we’re still very close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">QUESTION:  And did you two talk about the wartime at that — in 1946, did you talk about the previous years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  No, we never did, even when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , we hardly ever talked about the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">It’s something that — and it was probably more so my brother than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">He just did not want to talk about it and so I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">He — he took the whole thing a lot harder than I did, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">QUESTION:  And in order to get food you said you had this folder, this camp folder, the red — the red side of —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, oh, oh, that, yes, most people that were — that have survived from a concentration camp, that were in a concentration camp, first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , that were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , first in Berlin were given a little identification by the Russian soldiers, it was in German and Russian, indicating that we were discriminated against and have survived a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And it was a red sheet of paper with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> logo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And once we — if — when we held that certificate going through <span class="DLF">lines</span> , buying food or other items, we could just hold that and could go to the front of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And there was not a single German that ever complained, us going to the front of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">In fact, they turned the other way, they didn’t even want to see this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> logo, they all knew what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And we had full privileges, even when we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Shortly after the war, some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> started running again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and we could go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , never had to pay to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , I mean we had a free hand in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> right after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  Were you able to go back to your original <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , original <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  The original <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> — well, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where th — I call it the ghetto type of a <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , where we were forced to live, that was bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">That was no longer in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">However, both of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , the first <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that I remember as a very small child, that my father had in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse and not very far, couple of blocks from there in Leipne(ph) strasse, which was the <span class="DLF">street</span> where — that suffered from the Kristallnacht, that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> <span class="DLF">Leipne(ph) strasse</span> , which was the street where — that suffered from the Kristallnacht, that store was still in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And I don’t recall us visiting either one of those <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> right after the war, before we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">But I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for my first time in 1975, I believe, and I did visit that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And it didn’t change much, and I just, a year ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">berli</span> — in April, a year ago when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I did visit it and of course there’s the one on Leipne(ph) strasse was for rent and the one on Petsalozzi(ph) strasse, there was a Chinese family living there and also they had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> <span class="DLF">Leipne(ph) strasse</span> was for rent and the one on Petsalozzi(ph) strasse, there was a Chinese family living there and also they had a store of Chinese artifacts and souvenir type items. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">In fact, I stopped and talked with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Their son, it so happened, graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University of California</span> , spoke pretty good English and I talked with him for probably close to an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And he found it very interesting that as a child I was living at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , at a — it did some — was some major remodeling done and more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Well, we had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> 1n that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> when we lived there before the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">A-And now it had some much nicer and more roomy type of <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and it was almost like a very comfortable type of an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  When you were with — studying with this young American soldier, was he helping other Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">ANSWER:  If he was, I’m not aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I don’t think so because he still was a soldier and I think he was a company cook and he still had to do his duties there and in his off time he worked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">So I doubt very much that he helped others, because we were not as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">He worked with us strictly as individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">QUESTION:  Did you learn English then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1146">ANSWER:  No, we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">We — the only word of English I knew was hello, goodbye and where’s the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">I think my brother learned a few more words of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">But incidentally, both my brother and I were able to communicate in Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We were not fluent, but we were able to communicate in Russian pretty good, because we’ve lived with the Russians for about 90 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">QUESTION:  And you were able to pick up the ru — Russian language?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">We were able to, and like I say, communicate and pick up, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I have completely forgotten it, I still know a few words, but I could not carry on a conversation and I can understand very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">QUESTION:  And then how much longer did you stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">ANSWER:  Okay, again, I think the Bar Mitzvah was in the spring of 1946 and we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in September 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">QUESTION:  I forgot to ask you an important question, did you get any gifts for your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  I don’t believe we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I don’t recall that we received any gifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">We were just so happy to be amongst our own without fear of being arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">That was a gift alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">QUESTION:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Did you feel connected to the Russian Jewish soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">ANSWER:  At the time, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">The — we didn’t meet too many of them, but yes, they treated us well, and I was somewhat connected, but not as much as once the Americans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I mean, we didn't even keep track of the Russian and Jewish soldiers, except some of them were at the Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">But we pretty much got connected to the American Jewish soldiers, both enlisted men as well as officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I even remember some of the names, Lieutenant Nowalski(ph), who helped us out, and there were a few other officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And the only names I can remember was Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) and Private Werner Nathan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">QUESTION:  Important names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And the name of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , you said you’re not sure?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  No, I wished I would know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I don’t know the address, I — I do not know the name, but I do know it was the only <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> not burned out, not burned by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with the German children your age, the non-Jewish chil-children? </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Did they talk to you, did you play with them, did you do anything with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">After the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">ANSWER:  After the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Well again, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for two or three months after the war, and we played with them and I still sensed there was some prejudice towards the Jews by some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But like I have shown you this — this is — the funny thing is is how I knew there was a write-up in this British magazine, The Illustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And there were — was a picture of my brother and I in that Illustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">It was a German kid whose parents knew English and subscribed to that magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And they are the ones that showed us that magazine with our pictures in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">You’re talking about the October 6", 1945 issue of The Illustrated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">ANSWER:  That is the issue I am talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And it was really one Jewish boy that was in our class after the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , that brought that magazine to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and showed it to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And so you s — how — you said you sensed some prejudice on the part of the German children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">How — an-an-and can you give an example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1191">ANSWER:  They were not friendly to us aft — they know — knew we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">They could — they could see me go in front of a <span class="DLF">line</span> to buy a loaf of bread, and they resented that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">The adults, they didn’t say a word, but th-the kids resented that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Of course, they probably didn’t understand why we had those privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">But I-I di — definitely saw resentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Wat — was there any more overt anti-Semitism? </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Any spitting, like you said before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1199">ANSWER:  Not that I notice it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Not that I notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I have notice anti-Semitism, especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> in the last five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1202">QUESTION:  We’ll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So you stayed, and you said Werner Nathan made arrangements with the American Joint Distribution — Jewish Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And so can you — let’s just talk about th-those arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Werner — we again explained to Werner — fortunately he was fluent in German, as he came from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> — that our father was an American citizen, died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we want to come — go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And again he did, on his own, he contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in New York, and a-again, I don’t remember how long it took, but I know in the meantime we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luneburg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and a-again, I don’t remember how long it took, but I know in the meantime we went to Luneburg where we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">recuperation camp</span> sponsored by the British military, who put us back into health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And it was an American soldier — in fact, I think it was that Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) that picked us up from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luneburg</span> , took us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and it was — again, that must have been in late August, because September seventh we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> on the SS Marine Marlin, that was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And besides — just recently I met an old man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , who was a seaman on the sister ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who also brought Jewish immigrants to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sister ship</span> of the SS Marine Marlin, who also brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don’t know anything about, never heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his — the — his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sister ship</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">SS Marine Marlin</span> , who also brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don’t know anything about, never heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his — the — his sister ship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So it’s quite a small world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">QUESTION:  What were your feelings about leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">You said that you felt partly German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">ANSWER:  I felt more — I was German and I acted like a German during the war, living under false or assumed names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But the day we walked onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , it was the greatest feeling you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you bring anything special with you from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  No, we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">We didn’t want anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Like when the Russians came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we — my brother and I each picked up some very expensive Leica cameras from <span class="BUILDING">photography stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Everybody else took it, so we took some of this belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">They took our belongings, the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">But we did not want anything German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">We did not bring anything back that was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">We — on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , we made a few dollars on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Well, I did, my brother got too seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">He was sick most of the way across. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">For some reason I did not get seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And pe — other refugees that were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> wanted to buy shaving cream or things that was in the — that you could purchase on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And they didn’t want to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> and so I used to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> for — for them and buy what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">In fact here’s a — I still remember this one gentleman wanted chewing gum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And I purchased and I took the German pronunciation for ch-chewing gum, which would be shaving gum, and instead of getting chewing gum for him, I ended up with a tube of shaving cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I still remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And I ended up — I have finally ended up selling it to somebody else, because he wanted chewing gum, not shaving cream.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1233">QUESTION:  Were there — was it all refugees on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">ANSWER:  I would say 99 percent were refugees, and again those were people either that were — survived at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or lived in hiding someplace, somewhere so — somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1235">QUESTION:  And again, did you talk to each other about what you had gone through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1236">ANSWER:  No, I don’t believe — I didn’t want to, my brother didn’t want to and I don’t think anyone aboard wanted to talk about what they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">It’s — yes, they wanted to get that out of their mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">QUESTION:  And how long did the voyage take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  It took 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">We left September seventh, we arrived — when I saw the Statue of Liberty in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that was September 17". </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Greatest sight you can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">QUESTION:  And what was it like to put your foot down on <span class="REGION">American soil</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  Oh, it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Something that we thought we would never see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And there were quite a few kids like us, orphan kids on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , again, also sponsored by the Joint Distribution Committee, most of them had no parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And they were like we were, maybe some of them thought they had a relative there, but again didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And again, it was representatives from the Joint that picked us up and took us to 441 Caldwell Avenue, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> — I mean, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> <span class="DLF">Caldwell Avenue</span> , Brooklyn — I mean, Bronx, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> <span class="DLF">441 Caldwell Avenue</span> , Brooklyn — I mean, Bronx, New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And of course we were fed and treated wonderfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And the next day we were interviewed by German speaking people, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Wa-Was this a family that you went to on — 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1250">ANSWER:  No, it was a— I really would say like an <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">It was for children, and we were in there and they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , several <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And they, of course, separated the boys and the girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">QUESTION:  And then after your interview, what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">ANSWER:  And then, of course, we told them that we had two uncles someplace in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> And they said well, were they from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And we said yes, they were originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , now ber — <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And they said, well there is a newspaper that has a nationwide publication plus <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Of course, we didn’t know <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was a neighbor of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">But they said they will put an ad in the “Aufbau” and see if our uncles — at that time we still thought they were uncles — if our uncles by any chance were to read that newspaper, as most German speaking Jews were subscribers to that newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Well, our uncles did not read it, but very good friends of theirs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Louis</span> , Missouri read that ad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And there were pages and pages and pages of kids or adults looking for people and most of them — it was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads, and these friends of my uncles, which turned out to be cousins, read that and called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">They were in Saint Louis, and my cousins — we’|I call them my true things, my cousins from my father’s side, were called up and said there are two kids, just came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they are looking for Alfred and Felix tau — Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And of course that’s when we learned they were cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And my cousins were both brothers and they had just, actually not that long ago had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , because one cousin lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> during the war, while the other one lived in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">But apparently they had kept in touch all through the war and they ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">How they ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> , I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> is a small community of about 35,000 people, and that’s where they ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And since they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the social welfare agency, Jewish social fe — agency wouldn’t let us live there and so we went to live with foster parents in Kansas City, <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> , Missouri. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">A family by the name of Levinson, and he was a very Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and we lived with them for probably four or five months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">But we had really problems living together, because we were not raised Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And so then we were moved into — in to another family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> th-then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">ANSWER:  Yes, we started th — both of us started in the eight grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Now remember, my brother went through the third grade, I went the second grade of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Even after the war, the short time we went to the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> then was still only the second grade, didn’t know English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">But we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in Kansas City, <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> , Missouri for two years, and they assigned a teacher to us who knew a little bit of German, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">She was Jewish, Mrs. Weinberg, and she worked as — worked with us — tutored us to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And what my brother and I did after we started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we took a German English dictionary and just studied it page by page, word for word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And after awhile it got so that we used words that the English teachers didn’t understand, or we used it in the wrong context. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And my brother then — this was in the ninth grade, I believe, I had a different English teacher than my brother did and my English teacher, she says — a Miss Ulrichi, she says, Fred, you have to buy some comic books and start reading comic books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I don’t care what comic books you read, but buy comic books and you will have the — a much — maybe not the best grammar in the world, but you will get English that is being used every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And I will say it really helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Reading the comics, I had a — seeing the pictures and getting most of it out, I probably learned more English from that than anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1283">QUESTION:  And what about your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">You were then — by then Fred? </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Was that your decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1286">ANSWER:  Oh, ba — my — my cousin who we lived with then, after Kansas City when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> when we moved to Joplin — oh, I should say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in Kansas City for two years, and then my — in the meantime my cousin brought in one of their aunts who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , at that time I believe still known as <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> for two years, and then my — in the meantime my cousin brought in one of their aunts who was in Israel, at that time I believe still known as Palestine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Well, it was ’48 when <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was — became an independent state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And they brought her there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and then we were permitted to live with them, and we went to the 10", 11" and 12" grade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">QUESTION:  And you s — and — and when did you change your name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1291">ANSWER:  We changed our name when we — we became citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Actually, I did not change my name from Horst Alfred until after I got out of the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Maybe we should go back to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , my brother finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  Did the — did the Missouri children accept you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Did you feel like an <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">We — in fact, we were asked to speak at assemblies about our — some of our lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And didn’t really want to talk about — we didn’t talk to a lot of the detail because we were ashamed to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">For instance, I didn’t want to talk, in fact I didn’t tell anybody I was in a concentration camp or in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or in a train, I was too ashamed of it, especially how I was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I mean, no 12 year old kid wants to talk about why they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And we didn’t say that we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but we just talked what it was life, the bombing and how it was life, living in fear, trying not to get caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And that’s really most of the things that we talked about to other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">But we were very well accepted by the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">We made a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">In fact, both my brother and I go to reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">In fact we have, in September, we have the 50" year reunion coming up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> , which I plan to attend and so does my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And we’ve made a lot of friends there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1309">QUESTION:  Did you take part in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities and sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1310">ANSWER:  Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Not in sports so much, but I actually was in ROTC, Reserved Officer’s Training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And we had rifle teams, we had drill teams a — which I participated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I also belonged to a — to various clubs, like the Key Club, which is the forerunners, I think to the Kiwanis, and I was very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">My brother was not too active, my brother — actually, my a— one of our cousins who we lived with was a pianist and he also taught piano, and my brother always wanted to learn the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">So while I was involved in a lot of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activity, my brother practiced and played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , but he, which I was not, got to really enjoy playing baseball, and learned — and became a very good baseball player. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And he belonged to a baseball team, a high school baseball team and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And that’s where his activity was, while mine was in drill teams and rifle teams and Kiwanis clubs and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">In fact, I even learned how to be a speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And this is why I do a lot of speaking engagements now and it doesn’t bother me to be — be speak in front of public, or even on TV, where I’ve taught many, many times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">QUESTION:  Did you feel very American at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1321">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I felt — after I got pretty proficient in English, in fact when I went in the U.S. Army, five years after coming here, nobody believed me that I was a — originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I spoke English like an American, rather than a foreigner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Through the years I started speaking German again, also learned Japanese and I speak both languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And so I — it seems like I’ve reacquired an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">This is tape number three, side B and you were talking about how you kept up — you were — you have an aptitude for languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">So then you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1328">ANSWER:  Graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1951 and then I applied to go to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Missouri</span> law school, since I had two uncles from my mother’s side that were lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">We also had uncles that were dentists, mostly from our mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">In fact, I know of one uncle who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> during the war, and I met somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> who — whose dentist was my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">But anyhow —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You — bu-but you were — what about undergraduate at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">What do you mean you applied to law — you wanted to apply to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  I applied after I got out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I applied to go to the University of Missouri and then eventually go into <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> <span class="BUILDING">University of Missouri</span> and then eventually go into law school, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Well, when I took the entrance examination for the <span class="BUILDING">University of Missouri</span> , apparently my score on the English part of the test was above average. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And I was told that I cheated because the results of the test score was much higher than it possibly could have been with the lack of education I have had and the short time that I have been in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> I did ask to take the test over again, but back in 1951 that was not done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">At — times have changed today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">But so — since I could not go to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Missouri</span> , I didn’t really know what I wanted to study then, because my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my parents wanted me to be a lawyer, my brother to be a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And so I was 18 and a half years old, or almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the army and get that out of my — out of my life here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And so I joined the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  And this was during the Korean war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  That was ko — during the Korean war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And after I took my basic training in Fort Leonard Wood, <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Leonard Wood</span> , Missouri, I was assigned to a replacement company there as a company clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And then one of the generals who was reassigned from Fort Leonard Wood, who was reassigned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , wanted a native speaking German to be his driver in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Leonard Wood</span> , who was reassigned to Germany, wanted a native speaking German to be his driver in Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">So I was picked to be the driver for this general, since I was a native speaking German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">But I, at that time I was not prepared to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and since I was still a citizen of the u — of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I did not have to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">QUESTION:  All right, you were not a citizen yet of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">ANSWER:  I was still a non-citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Now, I did take — this was kind of odd — I did take the examination for citizenship in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rolla</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Leonard Wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">In fact this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">college town</span> , I think it was a — still is a very well known <span class="BUILDING">engineering school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And this is where, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I took my exam for citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">In fact, one of the questions that I was asked by the examiner — and I was in U.S. Army uniform, I was a corporal at the time — and this examiner, one of the questions asked, if I were called to serve in the U.S. military in time of war, would I do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And I looked at him, I said, well... And he says yes, I — I’m sorry that I have to ask that, but that — that is the rule, and I realize you are in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">It k-kind of struck me odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">And anyhow, I took my citizenship examination, which I passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">Of course, it was everything I had learned in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , in government and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Was a — to me — for me it was a very simple exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And it was really about — shortly wi — thereafter, when I had the orders to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but then I looked up the Jewish chaplain in Forth Leonard Wood, and I told him a little bit of my story, and of course he got my a — says no, I don’t have to go and they canceled my order to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">But abou —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Why did you not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1360">ANSWER:  I-I still had too many bad memories in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And the feeling there, I just was not prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And I also — besides that, I didn’t want to be a driver for a general. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">I wanted to learn something while I was in the military rather than drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> around and be what I considered a nursemaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And so my orders three days later were for <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And I had a two weeks leave, went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joplin</span> , visited my friends and said the goodbyes and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And I went to Fort Lewis, Washington, which is about a fr — one hour drive out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lewis</span> , Washington, which is about a fr — one hour drive out of Seattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And I kind of fell in love with that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I said to myself, if I make it back alive from <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , this is going to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and that was 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">QUESTION:  How did you feel putting on an American army uniform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">ANSWER:  Proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">I was very proud to be wearing the army uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And I think this is why I made, even through the enlisted rating, I made rank much faster than ma — the average American citizen counterpart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">While these people complained about the military and they didn’t want to work, I did my duty and I was proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">And I believe this is why in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , even though there were sergeants that were 15 years in the army, I passed them up and received the rank of warrant officer appointment, when others way ahead of me should have received it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">It was probably a responsibility I had at my age that I shouldn’t have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">I was only 20 years old when I became a warrant officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">21 years old, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">But I always felt proud to be an American soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1379">QUESTION:  What were your duties in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1380">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> I — my fir — my first duties were to code reports that came from the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , and pick out the soldiers that were killed in action, wounded in action, missing, and I also had the locator; an assignment I wasn’t supposed to have had as I was not a U.S. citizen, but I had that assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And then I got — those papers I got ready to be put into, which now are computers, in those times they were machine accounting, we programmed them with — through plugboard wires and punch cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And the man that was really in charge and doing the actual operating of the equipment was a warrant officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Well, he was killed driving over a <span class="DLF">mine</span> and — which I didn’t know, but he — he was late in bringing the reports in, which I had to code, for him to process through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">But instead of him coming in, the — a colonel came in and stuck a couple of warrant officers’ bars on my shoulder, tore off my sergeant stripes and says, you have just been appointed to a warrant officer, you are going to be — replace Mr. Eberhart(ph) — a warrant officer is addressed as mister — who was killed in action, and we will have a replacement for you shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">After my replacement came in, they assigned another warrant officer to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> and sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> for three weeks, where I learned how to operate those machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And after three weeks I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and continued the duties as a warrant officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1387">QUESTION:  Did you ever — when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , did you ever see any bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1388">ANSWER:  I see — saw a lot of bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1389">QUESTION:  And did that remind you of your experience during the war, being in the railroad car and during the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> and during the bombing of Berlin, seeing bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1390">ANSWER:  No, it did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">It did not remind me at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">Is — was sad, seeing American soldiers dead, but it di — it was not even close to reminding me what it was like in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> , because first of all, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> it was dark and you — most of the time you couldn’t see the bodies, you couldn’t see the faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">And even if you could, you didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And you just saw people that were dead and I never related that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">I felt sorrow for the poor American soldiers that were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">And again, it’s just like I felt that way ever since a child in — during my life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that when my time is up I’m going to go, and if not, P’Il keep on going and living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">QUESTION:  And how long did you stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1476">QUESTION:  Are there any sights or sounds today, or smells that remind you of your wartime experience, that kind of triggers a memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">ANSWER:  Well, a good experience is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> just about three weeks ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">Again, like I say, I’m still in the computer business today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">One of the things we do is we host websites. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">The — we have a election coming up very shortly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , one of them is for mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">A man that’s running for mayor is presently the city attorney, who happens to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And his website is Sidran for Seattle mayor dot org, dot com, we’ve used all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">Well somebody who doesn’t like him put up another website and called it Mark Sidran dot com, which is this — this attorney who 1s running for, his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">Well, his website is only Sidran for Seattle mayor because Mark Sidran was already taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Well, that website has a huge swastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a — a Nazi, as an SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And it’s somebody that is upset with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And that — seeing that swastika bothers me more now than it did when I saw it every day and lived with it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Another time — and I refuse to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — I — a few years ago I had a client in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and we were doing big business, really, with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And finally — and we always talked over the phone, always in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">This was, of course, back quite some time, before email really, where we sent faxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">We sent faxes back and forth, always in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And in 1979 I visited him in person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">And we had a appointment at 15 minutes before 12 at his <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I got there at 15 minutes before 12, told his receptionist who I was, and she said yes, I’ll let Mr. — I forgot his name now — I’ Il let him know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">And so I waited, and then I asked the receptionist, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I spoke no German at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And ask him well, does he have somebody with him, is he busy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">She says no, but he must be busy, but he’Il be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">And at exactly 12 o’clock — and at exactly 12 o’clock he comes out and he starts speaking German to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">Herr Taucher, and used the German pronunciation and didn’t say I’m sorry or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">And I spoke in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">And he didn’t even know I spoke engli — German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">We never before spoke German, it was strictly a business relationship in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">He spoke very good English when we talked over the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">His communication in English and on faxes was excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">And I said, don’t you s-speak English? </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">You know, we’ve been communicating — yes, bu — and in German he answers, but you are in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you have to speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">So I finally said, okay, I'll play your silly game. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">In German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Of course, that startled him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">And the next thing he says, oh it’s 12 o’clock, I have to go lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Well, thanks for stopping in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">I said goodbye, and I have never communicated with this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">And we gave it to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">And I have found other times in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , that is the mentality I find in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">Anyplace else, and that includes <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> , I have not found that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">The people say in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> you have a lot of anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found that myself in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , yes, I can see kids even, 17 — 18 year old kids giving the Hitler youth — I-I mean, the Hitler salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">That is completely illegal and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in <span class="REGION">east Germany</span> that’s not permitted and they get arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> the police turns around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">And I see the Nazi mentality all over again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and I refuse to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1522">QUESTION:  What does that do to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1523">ANSWER:  It —1it hurts me, it bothers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">And again, if I were younger, I would probably get myself in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">But I — I will say my training in judo and karate does teach you discipline, and you don’t start a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">But I-I am afraid in my younger days, I could have lost myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">It does bother me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">QUESTION:  Do you think about your experien — your wartime experiences now often, more often?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1529">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">What — when I really we — in fact, that’s the first time in many, many years that I have nightmares is when I took Patricia, who you met, with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> last year, and I took her to the <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> , the old SS — <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">In fact, that was Himmler’s headquarters, where they also had the <span class="INT_SPACE">torture chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And they had some records of me, and I was asked to give a taped interview there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">And the first thing, of course I asked, why do you want it for? </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">What do you want it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And this gentleman who I talked to, he was in his middle 30’s, I'd say, he says, well there’s so much denial going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that we want to get interviews from people that have been here, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">There were a number of Germans that were also arrested and tortured there, and we’d like to interview every one of them, and then we are s-spreading those tapes through high schools throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> throughout Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">So, of course I agreed to that interview and I had probably a 45 minute interview there, all in German, so that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids can fully understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1539">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you before about that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">How 1s it that you did not release any information when they were questioning you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">You were so young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1542">ANSWER:  I think it’s — I first knew that if I released information, my mother and my brother would also be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">I knew that first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">Second, every time when I was ready to talk, they tortured me so much that I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And when I came to again, again I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">I mean, there were times, I’ve told you some of them, like pulling teeth, filling teeth without any medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">Other times I remember they had me jump in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathtub</span> full of ice cubes, full of ice, and then immediately go out in very hot water, and — which, I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And it — things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Some of it I— I don’t even want to talk about it, it’s just — but when I did visit that <span class="NPIP">place</span> with Patricia, they make — made a memorial out of it now, maybe you’re aware of that, I had nightmares for the next two or three nights in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">Yeah, they really brought back the memories like it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1551">QUESTION:  Are there any smells that — that stimulate mem — are any smells that stimulate you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1552">ANSWER:  Occasionally so-some things maybe — you smell something, maybe there was a dead animal around in a real hot climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">Yes, that — that does remind me, but I try to wipe it out of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">But yes, occasionally that has reminded me, mostly of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">And even — I'll say it, even smelling dog feces, that reminds me of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">This is tape number four, side A, and we were talking about sounds and sights that — that trigger memory for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Anything else that you wanted to include?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1724">ANSWER:  Maybe time and age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">And I have gotten used to talking about it and feel it is necessary that the world still knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">I have found too many young people, educated people that know so little of what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">In fact, some of these people even believe what they read on the internet, that it didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">And that’s when I started to talk about it more, and that’s why it’s a lot easier to talk about it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">Even today as we were talking there were some times, I don’t know if you noticed, I was getting choked up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">And that I can’t help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">But at one time I just could hardly talk, th — I had to take a break and couldn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">But now it’s — it’s not like that any more.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Were you active in the Civil Rights movement, or — ve — well, because you lived in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where people’s civil rights were denied?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1757">ANSWER:  No, I was never active in the Civil Rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">Again, I was too young, and of course — well, I don’t know if you ever heard of The White Rose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1759">QUESTION:  Yes [inaudible]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Then you know I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">These were Germans, and they were all executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">In fact, I think they were first tortured at the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> I was at, and then hung at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plotzensee</span> , which was the place where the — where the gallows were where they hung the Germans that didn’t go along with the regime or helped Jews or so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1762">QUESTION:  A-And what is the connection? </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">We were talking about your activity in the Civil Rights mov —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, I was not — I was not active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">I was just saying the people that were active did not live very long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1765">QUESTION:  No, no, no, I — that’s not what I meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">I meant, were you active in the Civil Rights movement in the United States, because you had lived in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because you had lived in a country that deprived others of civil rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">Did you — was this something that you’ve worked towards as an adult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1768">ANSWER:  As an adult, no, I was not active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">I think — I think you’re going back to the 1960’s and 70’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">First of all, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , we did not have the problems there that you have had in other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">For instance, we’ve had Afro-American mayors in s — in — 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">Exec — the present county executive is a — 1s a black man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">And lately here we’ve had a few more problems, but that is because we get these activists coming in, not even from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , that demonstrate on — any time there’s something going on, starting when we had that WTO there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">And these are people that were — are actually being paid to demonstrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">And — but lately we ni — didna — we have not had good leadership in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">The mayor, even though — the present mayor, even though I supported him, Paul Schell, is not very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">The previous police chief, the present police chief is not very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">And if anything I am an activist now to get those people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">And again I’m very much up within the city councilor, like I said earlier, I’m sort of on the sister city council of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> and I know most of the politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1780">QUESTION:  So you are active in the political life of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1781">ANSWER:  In the political life, yes, I am very active in the political life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1782">QUESTION:  Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1783">ANSWER:  Well, probably it goes back because about 30 years ago the former governor of the state of Washington, Albert D. Rosellini and I became good friends, strictly through my C.P.A. And my C.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And the former governor is an American, but he is from Italian parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">In fact, a book has been written on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">And my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph) introduced me to Governor Rosellini, and they have been long, long friends, and they always speak Italian together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">And over the years Governor Rosellini and I have become very close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">And he is the man — again probably because I am in the computer business and I did mailings for candidates and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1789">QUESTION:  So it’s not because you were aware of what can happen when a political system goes awry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1790">ANSWER:  No, definitely not, it is just that I helped in the political party and some of them — right now yes, I’m very active to get Mark Sidran elected as mayor, because first of all, he is Jewish and he tries to eliminate demonstration that shouldn’t be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">Again, people like — that put up that swastika, and he’s definitely, of course, against that, and he is against, naturally, anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">And lately we have seen a little bit of that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1793">QUESTION:  What does that do to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1794">ANSWER:  It bothers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">And again, that’s why I’m very much in support of Mark Sidran for mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">And hopefully he will have a police chief that can do the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1797">QUESTION:  When you see pictures of victims in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">Sudan</span> , what does that do to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1798">ANSWER:  That bothers me, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1799">QUESTION:  Because of your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1800">ANSWER:  I’m sure it is, and again I say why does that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">Again, I was all for the U.S. to help out with troops over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">I didn't like the way it was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">And again, 1-it bothers me, is just like the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> could have helped many million of Jews being saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">And why they aren’t helping out further bothers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">I don’t like what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">I think they — it was good for us to be in there, but why not get rid of the main cancer in <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> , which is still over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">And those things bother me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1808">QUESTION:  Do you think you are more sensitive to that than those of us who did not grow up in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1809">ANSWER:  I’m sure I am, I’m sure I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">I know a lot of people, including Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> that did not like us going into <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">They say why should we get involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">I said, the same reason we should have been involved to save Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">And some of them, like I say, even other Jewish people I know, were against that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1814">QUESTION:  Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1815">ANSWER:  Yes, lately I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">I have spoken to two different rotary clubs in the <span class="REGION">Seattle area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">I spoke to the troops in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lewis</span> , mostly officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">In fact, had a long talk afterwards with the assistant commanding general of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lewis</span> , a two star general. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">And yes, I do talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1820">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1821">ANSWER:  Again, like I say, it cannot be forgotten and the people, so many of the younger generation, are not learning enough in <span class="BUILDING">s-schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">And I’m talking about even college students do not know enough about it, and they should know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">And that’s why it feels very important, people like me, survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , should speak publicly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> now, we have the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Education Center</span> , and they get the requests for speakers and I am signed up as a speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1825">QUESTION:  Do you — have you been to any conferences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1826">ANSWER:  Yes, I attended the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and was the chairman of that ho — Child Survivors Conference of the Holocaust in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , that we had last September. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">And the — prior to this I did not, as my ex didn’t want me to go to any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">But — and now I plan to go, as long as I’m healthy, I plan to go to every one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">The next one is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> in October, and the following year itll be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">And right now I’m not at liberty to say there’s another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in another state that wants to have a conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">And they have asked me to help them organize it because they were in — the main organizers were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , and — and again, that state has very few survivors, which of course <span class="REGION">Washington state</span> has, and I put on, I feel, a fairly decent conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1832">QUESTION:  How is it that you got to be the one to put on the conference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1833">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> know what I’ve been very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">I serve on the United States Olympic Committee, and we put on several fundraisers that I have headed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">And incidentally, Governor Rosellini is the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee for <span class="REGION">Washington state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">I have also been involved in professional associations where I have put on conferences here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">At that time data processing management association, of which — End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher, and this is tape four, side B, and you were talking about putting on conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1838">ANSWER:  And anyhow, some of the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , the survivors and so forth, knew that I had been very active in different activities, putting on conferences and banquets and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , at the conference there, I was asked if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> could put th — on the conference, since initially it was scheduled for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vancouver</span> , B.C., about a two hour drive from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">And if — they cancelled the Vancouver consom — conference, but still wanted it, and then asked if we could put it on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">And I said, if I can get the proper facilities, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">And so I found the proper facilities and then I got the survivors — child survivors of the Holocaust in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , there were about eight or nine of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">And I presented that, and with the exception of two people that dropped out, they asked me to be the chairman of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">And that’s how it came about that I headed that conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1845">QUESTION:  And obviously you feel a connection to these other child survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1846">ANSWER:  Oh, I certainly do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">And we — we meet monthly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">And we’re just a small group, but we do meet monthly and kind of talk about how we survived and what we can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1849">QUESTION:  Are you proud of yourself that you were able to make a life after such a difficult childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1850">ANSWER:  Yes, I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">I am very proud of what has happened, and some of it I blame my parents for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">I mean, they tre — they raised us — and I’m saying rus — us, my brother and I, the proper way, even as young as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">And I am proud of my accomplishments and I am proud of my brother’s accomplishments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">Be — being — going in as a private recruit in the army, no college education, working up to a field grade officer, which a major 1s, he can be proud of himself, and I am proud of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1855">QUESTION:  Did he marry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1856">ANSWER:  Well, he actually has been — he’s on the third marriage right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">And as you probably know, a lot of survivors do have troubles staying married, but he now is married to a girl from s — originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , and they’ve been married now for about 22 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1858">QUESTION:  Does he have children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1859">ANSWER:  He has one daughter from his very first mar — marriage, which he never should have married, and then he has two boys from his second marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">I think he is somewhat in contact with one of the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">And he has two children, a boy and a girl from his present marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1862">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">Did you, when you c — came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , try to stay in touch with Frau Noelting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1864">ANSWER:  Yes, we did, we wri — have written to her, but e — I think she wrote back once, and it was a very disturbing letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">She still — she was just as upset when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and also wrote to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">First of all, she criticized the ge — the poor spelling and so forth, and grammar we used in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">Of course, we had a second and third grade education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">So of course our writing skill wasn’t very good in German. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1869">sneeze] Bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1870">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1871">ANSWER:  And she criticized that and she really criticized us going to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> And I think we did answer her, but we never heard anything from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">Now, my brother, when he was stationed as a military soldier — in fact I think he was a lieutenant or a captain at that time in the army — excuse me — and he was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , he did visit Trowta(ph) Noelting, the stepdaughter, and they did get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">And I think they had a very good get together, and I think it was shortly after Frau Noelting had passed away, and they talked about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">She — she was very old in age, and really didn’t want to die, but she knew she was dying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1875">QUESTION:  So your only contact with Frau Noelting was that one letter, and then her return —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s what I can remember, and I’m pretty sure my brother will agree to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1876">QUESTION:  And then what was your connection with Werner Nathan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1877">ANSWER:  Again, I actually visited him with my ex-wife in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">And again, it must have been — I was an officer in the Data Processing Management Association and we had a convention in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that my ex went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">And that must have been in ’69 or ’70 and we went to visit him, but then I lost track. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">I n — lost track of him once when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> in the army, but then I found his address again and actually was able to look him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">And he was doing very well, he had a very successful ber — furniture business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">We went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">In fact, he picked us up at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , I think, in a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cadillac</span> at that time, I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">And he was very well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">But then again we lost track. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">Again I was in the midst of building a business and spending too much time in the business and didn’t take time to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">And then I know I had written him again maybe six months or a year later and the letter came back and no forwarding address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">So — and that’s when we lost track. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">And he may be — may have moved out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">But I have tried to look it up on the internet, but unless they have a listed phone number, you can’t find them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1891">QUESTION:  Do you receive reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1892">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">And this is again one of my reasons that I’m going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> next month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">It’s one thing — first of all I play to reestablish my German citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">I have found out a lot of survivors, especially in our new group here, have rees — established their citizenship and I know some people are getting as much as 1100 dollars a month pension from the German government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1896">QUESTION:  When you say your new group, what do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1897">ANSWER:  The group that we have formed, each state has formed their own little group, a survivor’s group and then we are combining it as the Holocaust Survivor Foundation, and all the various other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">For instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> we have formed the Survivors of the Holocaust Asset Recovery Project. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">And we are going to join as an affiliate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">We’re still separate corporations, but we will be part of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">And a number of these people, they are all elected officials from their own state, just like I am president of the Washington state group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">And — and a lot of these people have reestablished their German citizenship because now in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , dual citizenship is permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">And by reestablishing the German citizenship, there is a chance to recev — receive a pension. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">And I’m going to take every penny I can get out of the German government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1905">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1906">ANSWER:  Well, they took too much away from my parents and from me, and I think I have a moral right to get some monies out of — I can live without it, I don’t need the money, but I think morally it’s right for me to get some money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1907">QUESTION:  What are your thoughts about Holocaust survivors today who are indigent or in — in dire straights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1908">ANSWER:  Well, this is — I have a real problem with the — you have the Claims Conference, that has received billions of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">In fact, the U.S. government gave them four million dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">And the — there are people, especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> that are living out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and begging for food, that are concentration camp survivors and not receiving any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">We had, at our meeting two days ago, we had Gideon Taylor, the — I guess the s — executive vice president from the Claims Conference talking and say well, half of the survivors are living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and the Claims Conference also has to look out for the people living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">And we have built memorials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">Well, we don’t want memorials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">We want money for the people that need it the most, and so we are trying to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">And first of — also, the Claims Conference is made up of mostly self appointed people that are not Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">And it should be Holocaust survivors that do the distribution of the funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">And that’s what we are working on right now, even if — if it’s necessary, we will sue the Claims Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">And they have to release some money because our people are dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">I have the 1999 tax return from the Claims Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">Oh, I didn’t bring it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">I didn't bring it with me, but where they had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or income of over 247 million dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">And yet they don’t have money to pay the people that need it the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">That is not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">And Mr. Gideon Taylor, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was 184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I don’t know what those benefits are, plus expense money that we don’t know how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">That shouldn’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">And we are, our group is trying to do something about it, and that’s why we met here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> last November, and just this week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">So in fact, I think you said you were at the — at our <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1928">QUESTION:  Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1934">QUESTION:  Why do you say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1935">ANSWER:  Well, were six million Jews — people tortured and murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">Children put to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">Yes, there were a lot of them, but I don’t think that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">And forced in sof — put into forced labor until they couldn’t stand up any more and then murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">I think when they were murdered, they were murdered a little more quickly than what the Germans did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">But a — a lesson learned? </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">No, I’m afraid not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">And again, it will take <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , Great Britain or other free <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> or other free countries to make sure it doesn’t happen again.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1945">ANSWER:  When you see things like this happen, don’t let it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">If you are in military age and you get asked to serve in your military in — of your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , which appear to be American, U.S., serve, and serve proudly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">I feel very strongly again, about the Vietnam war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">It was wrong, we all know it was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">But for every American that refused to serve, somebody else went and died for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he did a fairly good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">He was a real friend towards <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">But I never voted for him and never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said he was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">And somebody, with that being in mind, avoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstrating against his own county — country about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">And that’s why I never voted for that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">Like I said just earlier, every American man that refused to serve, somebody else went and died for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">Look at me, I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> for five years, getting out of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , but I served my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I was proud to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">My brother served this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and proud to serve, both of us as officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1958">QUESTION:  You said that you — earlier on that you lost your childhood, you weren't a little boy after awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">Did you ever get that childhood back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1960">ANSWER:  No, no, that’s — that’s gone forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">I will say that when my brother and I first came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> , we for some reason started loving watching cowboy movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">We'd go all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> , if there was a cowboy movie on like a Roy Roger, or Gene Autry, Johnny McBrown, I can still remember some of those names, we loved to watch those movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">And maybe that’s maybe coming back a — a childhood where kids maybe at the age of 10 would love that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">We were 13 and 14 and we loved those movies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1965">QUESTION:  Did you t-talk about your parents with your brother once you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">Is it still a topic of conversation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1967">ANSWER:  Yes, at first we definitely did and we always for many years thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">We talked about it, we wondered where our mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">And probably my brother more so than I, that I quit talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">We talked about our mother and father and he would start crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">And for some reason I —I would not — I— I mean, maybe mentally I was stronger than he was, I am not sure.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  What — what do you attribute the difference in response to your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1974">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">Again, maybe — I was younger and my brother was a year older and I think maybe he matured more — he was more mature in that respect than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">A-Again, I can’t really give you a full answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">But I remember more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">And yet, when it came to memory of our parents, my brother was much more emotional than I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1979">QUESTION:  Did he have more awareness of the danger that you were in, or do you think it was equal, that your awareness was the same as his?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1980">ANSWER:  We were both aware equally, but my brother was more a-afraid, more scared, not only of being caught by the SS or the Nazis, but also he was scared, very scared of the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">That frightened him, when he could hear the bombing, the artillery, the anti-aircraft. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">He was very, very frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1983">QUESTION:  Was it because of sound for — he was more sensitive to sound? </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">You said he wanted to be a pianist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">Do you think maybe the sound was more harsher for him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1986">ANSWER:  You know, I never th — gave that a thought, but he is very musically inclined, and now is a very excellent pianist, incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">And I never gave that a thought, but maybe that’s what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">He — his sound 1s better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">I mean, I tried to take a — violin lessons, but I’m just not musically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">But a — I don’t know if that’s it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1991">QUESTION:  Was he as physically strong as — as you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1992">ANSWER:  Probably more so physically strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">Again, in sports, he was much better in sports than — than I was, especially in baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">Too bad I bra — didn’t bring it aga — along, I should ha — should make a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">In 1947, the “Kansas City Star” had a picture of us both first coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> , and we were playing baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">I think my brother was a batter and I was a catcher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1997">QUESTION:  What did baseball represent to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1998">ANSWER:  <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> <span class="COUNTRY"> America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">And we learned how to play baseball very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">I was never very good at it and my brother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">I was a better swimmer, I — than my brother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">I think in — in sports my brother was much better than I was, except for swimming, which I could do better. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">I guess I am more in a individual sport like swimming and martial arts and so forth, while my brother was more in a team type of sports, like baseball.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2006">QUESTION:  Are they named after anybody specifically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2007">ANSWER:  Walter was named after my uncle, who was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">No, I had two uncles by the name of Walter. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">One of them was a lawyer and one of them was a doctor — a — a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">And Audrey, her middle name we gave to — as Teresa, which was our mother’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">But actually, she thinks — she and her mother are very close, and she and I are very close and she doesn’t hold our divorce against each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">She — she understands her mother, and — but she did change her middle name to Cavanno(ph), my mother’s maiden name. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">I mean, my wife’s maiden name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2014">QUESTION:  Do you think that the — the interest in the Holocaust now is something that’s permanent or just a passing —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I think it’s permanent. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">Yeah, I think it’s very permanent and my daughter is very much interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">When we had the conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , the Child Survivors of the Holocaust, my daughter went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> to participate in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">Because — I was probably one of the first to include second generation, much to the disagreement of the previous people from the Child Survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">But I included quite a number of the second generation, I had seminars that both second generation and survivors could attend, because I found out some — a lot of the second generations wanted to be involved and hear from other survivors than just their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">And so I did include a number of activities the second generation, and my daughter did attend a lot of the sessions.</span></p>
