<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can you tell us your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Esthy Adler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I think I was born in , <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> , but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Any of the information that I'm likely to give you I think, but there was nobody close enough to me to corroborate any of the information, so I really am not entirely sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Give us your earliest memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My earliest memories going to <span class="NPIP">seaside place</span> with my parents, which was not too far from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My guess is, and speaking to people, I was told that it was probably on the Baltic because is not too far from the Baltic. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">That's really my earliest memory that I have of my parents and being there and not wanting to be left there because we had a caretaker with two children, and they were twins, and they were very mischievous and they always tried to play pranks on me, and I never wanted to be left alone there. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So, one of the earliest memories I have is my parents bring me out there and wanting to leave me there and my absolutely refusing to stay without them. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They didn't leave me, actually, they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, that's one of my earliest memories I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Do you have any recollection of what they look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Very vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I remember my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I seem to remember a dark haired woman rather pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father all I remember is that he wore glasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Isn't that strange? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I don't remember much more about him but that he wore glasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Were you an only child as far as you rememberâ€™?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, as far as I remember I was an only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What do you remember after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Did the war come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Well, I do remember that on one of those trips to our <span class="BUILDING">summer place</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , I remember being very tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I didn't understand clearly, but I understood that there was something going on and that my parents were very tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They were trying to leave me there, and I didn't want to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Then I remember that we couldn't go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">After that, we just couldn't go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Somehow, we had to go somewhere else, and we ended up going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my mother's sister lived, and we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I remember the language was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I remember she had several children including a pair of twins, twin girls, red headed twin girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Isn't that funny some of the memories one has? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I remember they spoke a different language and they sort of made fun because I couldn't speak the same language, but it quickly sort of faded because I seemed to have learned enough words to get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My guess 1s is that was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and that's when I started learning Polish, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So, that's some of the earliest memories I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Then I have another memory of my mother dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I remember she was ill, but very briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I have memories of my mother going out and bringing back donuts, jelly donuts, and I remember hugging her and she had snowflakes on her shoulder and her hair, and that's one of the early memories that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I assume it snowed quite a bit in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so I probably had that experience more than once, but I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Then I remember my mother dying June the 9th and my father bringing me over to my aunt's place, which was in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> only a different <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I remember a great deal of upset in my life as a result of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Were you aware that she had died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My father told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My father came to get me from my aunt's and told me that my mother had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I think that's the way he put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And that I wasn't going to see her anymore and that I had to be very brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And then I remember a woman moving in with us, somebody who took care and cooked for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Then still later, I remember my father remarrying, but that's only a vague memory, and I remember my aunt being very disapproving of the marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Apparently he made an unsuitable marriage, and I remember always a lot of talk about it behind closed <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and as soon as I walked in there would be silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I figured there was something wrong with the marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">She was very young, the woman he married, and she was a very good looking woman and I suppose that didn't go down too well with my mother's sister and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So, that's some of the earliest -- and then suddenly a great deal of the war started intruding. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I remember being on the <span class="DLF">street</span> once with my father and Germans marching, and my father was holding on to me in such a tight way that I knew there was something wrong that he was tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">You know, how you communicate with children that there is something not quite right and he told me to be very quiet, which I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I remember the Germans marching and a lot of the people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> applauding as the Germans marched by. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was a very somber atmosphere suddenly and neighbors kept on dropping in and there were meetings late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Sometimes I would hear through the slightly opened <span class="DLF">door</span> that there were people meeting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , you know, and talking and sort of making plans on what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I knew there was something very menacing going on, but I didn't know exactly what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Then the first inkling how menacing it could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We were at dinner one day and I heard an enormous explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The noise, like my heart stopped for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was so close and so loud and I was told that that was a bomb that dropped very closely by. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, that's how it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">That's how I remember the war really. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Then I remember people organizing themselves in a <span class="INT_SPACE">hiding place</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> was made ready for people to go down in case of bombings and in case of raids also by the Germans and the Poles together I assume. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I remember very often being woken up and being asked to dress very quickly and very quietly and everybody was trooping down into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">After coming out on one of those raids, I wanted to go and see a friend who didn't live in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but who lived just a couple of <span class="DLF">streets</span> away, and my father said I couldn't go by myself anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I used to go by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was just maybe around the corner, a couple <span class="DLF">streets</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, he took me there and we walked over there and suddenly all I saw was a pile of rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was gone, and my friend was gone and everybody in it was gone, and I remember coming back and for the first time feeling very threatened, really threatened, that maybe the same thing was going to happen to our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and to us in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That was a very threatening moment I remember very distinctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">From the on there was a whole series of raids and bombings which I --it got to a point where I was afraid to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> you know, because it was very frightening when it happened at night and I felt if I didn't go to sleep maybe it wouldn't happen, but it just kept on happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">On one of those raids we all trooped down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and I remember, there must have been bombs falling all over because the noise was just absolutely deafening. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I remember very distinctly that stay in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> because we ran out of food and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There were some children, and there was one child who kept on yelling for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He sat next to me and that child, that little boy and I remember on one of those occasions when he started yelling his father put his hand on his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I didn't see it because there was no light, but I could feel his arm and the little boy started struggling and kicking and then he just lay very still. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My father said you have to be very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You cannot do what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You cannot yell or cry or do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You do exactly as I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He was telling me that in my ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I really did what my father told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I really learned how to be very quiet, because even though I didn't fully understand what it meant I knew it was something final and terrible that had happened to that little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So, I knew that I had to do as my father said. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We stayed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and I don't know for how long because one day they just discovered us and they ripped open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they got us all out in German , of course, and it was full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was at night and barking dogs and when I hit the <span class="DLF">air</span> I fainted, so I don't remember what else happened there except when I woke up we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I was with my step mother and aunt and the two girls, but all the men were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were only one or two old men and all the other men were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They must have taken them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That's the last time I saw my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don't remember ever seeing my father after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So, that was the beginning really of most of my memories of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That's the way it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Did you ask people what happened to my father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  You asked but you didn't get answers and I very quickly learned not to ask because it was annoying, and my step mother was very short tempered. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And my aunt did a lot of crying and she had two little girls who were always sort of hanging on to her arms, so there was really nobody I could ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">There was some other people that I knew vaguely but I didn't know them well enough and I very quickly learned not to ask questions unless I would get an answer immediately I never asked a question again because I knew it was annoying. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Very often they couldn't give me any answers and I was learning not to annoy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was too dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  How old do you think you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  I don't know, maybe five, maybe six. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I don't know how old I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Did you feel close to anybody after your father left at that moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  I was clinging to my aunt, really, because my step mother I hardly knew, and she was not a patient or sort of nurturing kind of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">She was very distant, so I didn't feel comfortable with her, but I was trying to cling to my aunt, but she had two little girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, there was a limit of how much she could really do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, I was learning very quickly to be alone, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  There were other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  There were some other children of various ages, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Were you friends with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I didn't know those children because I didn't know where they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I'm not even sure that many of the people who were with in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> survived, because we were there for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My guess is a week, no food no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That is a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I think probably a lot of the elderly died. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The men were all taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They're weren't that many left, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Some of them I knew by sight but I really didn't know them well enough and there weren't that many children in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There were my two cousins and that little boy who died and if there were any others I hardly remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So there weren't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There were other children in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I didn't know them really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Tell us about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="128">What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  It was out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It was surrounded by <span class="DLF">fields</span> and trees and it was obviously <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> , is that what <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> must have had because that was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It must have been <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Also, you know, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and such and there were mostly <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and people were housed very crowded in and every morning the younger women would be marched out at daybreak into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to work, and the others were left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="133">At night they would come back and we would all congregate on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> where they would bring out some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Everybody went up. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We all had a tin plate or something or wooden plate, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I don't remember what it was really and we would get something to drink and some soup and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Then, one day they marched the women out as usual and then instead of leaving us in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , the rest of us, the children and the somewhat elderly, people not well enough to march out, they rounded us and they started marching us to one particular <span class="REGION">wooded area</span> and when we got there we noticed that there were a few men digging a sort of a deep <span class="DLF">hole</span> and then they told us all to line up and I noticed that they had machine guns lined up across from us and they opened fire on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Then all we did was sort of topple into that <span class="DLF">hole</span> into that <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Those of us who weren't hit, fell anyhow because there were so many bodies milling about and I fell in there, and I must have lost consciousness for a while because when I woke up I started moving and I was sort of on top of bodies and there were other people on top of me and I felt some stickiness and I looked and it was blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I wasn't sure if I was alive or dead, but I sort of sat up. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">By then there was nobody around, and I sort of climbed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was easy enough to climb out because it was on even ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I climbed out and I sort of ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and I sat down in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There was very thick <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and bushes, a real <span class="ENV_FEATURES">undergrowth</span> , and I sat down there because it was daylight and I figured I couldn't go out into the <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Then I heard a man with a dog coming, one of those big -- and suddenly I looked and there was the man and that huge German shepherd walking towards me and I thought, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I thought that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The German shepherd stuck his head in under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Went like this and stuck his head out and continued with the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">To this day I don't understand what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I really don't understand because those dogs were really trained to hunt people, and I don't understand what happened, but they passed and I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I stayed there until it was dark and then I came back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to where I stayed with my stepmother and everybody wanted to know what happened because everyone realized what had happened, that something had happened, but they didn't know exactly what, and that particular <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , you know, most of the people in it were missing and there were a few other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where probably some survivors had also gone back, but you didn't run back between <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> once you were into your <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , so everybody asked me what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Then it was decided, there was one other little girl who had come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I didn't even notice her, you know, I didn't even know where she was from, and it was decided that the two of us the next day when the women marched out to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> that we would stay under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and we weren't going to move until they came back at night, and that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So, in the morning when everybody left the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , by then it was just the working women in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we too, stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we stayed under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don't think we stayed there too long because shortly afterwards they rounded everybody up at sunset, you know, after they came back from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and they started marching the whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">All the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were rounded up and there were a few children and the children were sort of hidden between women, large skirts covered the children, and I guess they didn't look too closely at the legs to notice that sometimes --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Were you under the skirts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The skirts were sort of wrapped slightly around us, and they marched us to the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and they shoved us onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Can we go back for a moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Were you wounded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I had a wound -- at that particular time I had one wound in the back, one bullet wound in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Later on I got other wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I have about one, two -- I have seven wounds, seven bullet wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">That was only one in the back that sort of grazed my back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION: <span class="DLF"> Sideways</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Must have been sideways, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  When you walked into the situation and you saw the guns, was there any time for something to go through your head or --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  There was no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There was no time and there were people sort of falling all over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">People were yelling and trying to run and you know how it is when people try to run and they don't know in which direction because no matter <span class="NPIP">where</span> they looked they were either standing with rifles or there were machine guns set up, so there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to run really. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">No, I don't remember realizing what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">All I knew was that I was tumbling into the <span class="DLF">pit</span> with everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I didn't really realize what else I could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  When you touched this blood --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  I didn't know if it was mine or if 1t was somebody elses. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">When you are hit by a bullet it doesn't hurt right away, but when it gets cold it gets stiff and it hurts, so my back was bothering me and obviously when they were trying to take my shirt off when I got back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , 1t was sticking to my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So, I must have had some kind of a bullet wound in the back because I remember it stinging by then I had learned not to yell or cry about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You learn very fast that there's no point in complaining, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So, I think I had one of the wounds there, it happened to me in the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Did you explain when the women asked you, did you explain what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I don't think anybody believed me about the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I don't think they believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They looked at me in such a peculiar way and one of the women said well I know they have a dog, and I know they walk around with that dog, so there was a dog and I could not have invented him because I don't think I was familiar with German shepherds and I described the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Except I described him but he had green eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">How can he have green eyes? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I saw green eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I don't think a dog has green eyes, really, but I described you know adequately so they that they thought maybe I did see a dog but they couldn't believe that the dog walked right past me and didn't start barking or tearing me a apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That was the point, because I think that's what they were trained for. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That was sort of a bizarre episode, that I just stopped talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I decided I'm not going to -- but it stuck with me really, it really did stick with me that bizarre episode with the dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Were you very hungry in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  I very often was very hungry, but what I remember most is thirst, always being thirsty and never having enough to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I think at one point I sort of lost my appetite for food except when you know you have a grumbling stomach, but I didn't know really. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I was always full of fear and hunger doesn't always assert itself when you're full of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Yes, I remember times that I was hungry, but not so much hungry as full of fear and very thirsty always. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There was never enough to drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Did the women -- I don't know if you remember, did they share their food with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  You mean after this? </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They would always bring back a piece of bread or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They couldn't bring back soup or something because they would have seen them, but they always managed to put a piece of bread in their pocket to bring back a piece of bread for us or something that could be carried unobtrusively. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">You know, they couldn't opening carry something because it would have given it away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  When were you fed, at night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Was there some soup?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  There was some soup or potatoes or something like that or cabbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There was very often cabbage and potatoes cooked together in sort of a soupy stuff which they handed out and a piece of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  Did the women there also give you some of what they were given?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Oh, you mean when we were still in the open? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">When we were still in the open they gave us some too. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">After that supposedly there weren't supposed to be any children or any idle mouths to feed so from then on, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But before that carnage, I don't know how else to call it, they did give us some food too, maybe not as much as the women, but we didn't need as much really. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Mostly what I remember is cabbage and potatoes, you know, cooked with some water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  But in spite of your fear, you were thinking very clearly where to go and what do to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I had to get out of that <span class="DLF">pit</span> , that I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I had to wait until it was dark because I didn't feel too comfortable being out in the daylight uncovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">By then I had already learned that I couldn't be anywhere where I was seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I did have the instinct to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where I had been with my stepmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">That I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I always had sort of a very good sense of direction, even in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , how to navigate my way and I learned very quickly how to navigate my way through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Was your stepmother there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  She had gone out and your aunt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  My aunt was killed with the two girls on that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">She and my two cousins were killed on that afternoon, and I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Don't ask my why. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It's a lottery definitely, yes, it really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Okay, so now they take you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for transport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  We went sort of shoved into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> and what I remember -- that's a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I really want to forget that because it was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I don't know how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> they had and how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I don't even know where they got all those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I didn't think there was that many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">It was very crowded and they really shoved us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was very hot and it stank and it was night, you know, and I was absolutely petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I was petrified then. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> stopped and they let us out, there were like search lights and again I could hear the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I could hear German spoken and dogs barking, lots of dogs barking, and they kept on pushing us, quick, quick ; they kept on really pushing us to this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and to that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I was so petrified that I don't remember the route that we took from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">All I know is that we ended up in another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> somewhere, but I do remember <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> with guards just a little bit off the ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> just high enough for them to be able to see what was going on and the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and everywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We ended up in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That other little girl was there too, and my stepmother and her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And then there was a third little girl in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> whom I didn't know and her mother and plus assorted other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">This was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> , and again every morning they would open up the <span class="DLF">gates</span> to get the women out into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , out in the <span class="DLF">working fields</span> , and we three children were taken to a big <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> which had a lot of carriages or not carriages but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> really, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">farming carts</span> and such and we three girls were told to stay there and not to move from there the whole day until the women came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we did usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I don't know for sure, but my guess 1s that all three of these women, my step mother and the two others were sort of the favorites of the guards very quickly became the favorite because they got privileges and I think the guard who usually patrolled that particular <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> knew that there were three children in there, but they didn't harm us. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We just sort of got used to the routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">At night they would bring us into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">The women usually brought some food back for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They went somewhere else to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I never saw the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And very early in the morning before they marched out the three of us would just sort of go in the shade, there was <span class="DLF">path</span> along the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was here and there was a <span class="DLF">path</span> here and we would go along the <span class="DLF">path</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> , and we had to just run across another <span class="DLF">path</span> and into the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> and we felt safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">One morning the guard appeared at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and told the women to walk out, and she took one of the little girls by the hand and said you come with me and he told the two of us, me and the other girl, you stay here, don't come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">By then we didn't want to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , we thought maybe he was trying to save her and leave us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So, we kept on following him and he kept on saying go back, go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He was getting angry with us so we sort of crept after him along the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and he walked out with that little girl to that <span class="DLF">path</span> that was between the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> and a body was lying on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It was the other little girl's mother and he took out a gun and he shot the mother and he shot the little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So, the two of us really very quickly ran back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We realized -- we didn't know what had happened, but that night when the women came back, one of the women was the sister of the woman who had been killed with her little girl and she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">She had red eyes, and when she walked out the others were saying that her sister had small pox or something and they didn't want the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or something contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I think it was small pox, because I remember noticing that the little girl had some pimples, so I figured it must be something like that, so they killed both of them to make sure that the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> didn't get infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Why I don't know, you wonder why. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But, from then on, it became even more threatening to be there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We had sort of gotten used to a little bit to the routine but 1t became very threatening. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I was sort of turning more and more inward and to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I spoke very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Inever complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">From then on I was just sort of living full of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I remember waking up a couple of nights and seeing there was a candle and they had put a blanket over the <span class="DLF">door</span> so that it wouldn't show through and they were digging the <span class="DLF">hole</span> , the women under one of the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And my step mother walked over very angrily told me turn to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and don't look. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">You haven't seen anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That's all she had to say to me, believe me, I didn't see a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">What I realized later on was they were digging a <span class="DLF">hole</span> to go out from under the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and since we were surrounded by <span class="DLF">fields</span> there too, came a night when they woke us up, the two little girls, and the two mothers, my step mother and she and we all made our way under the <span class="DLF">holes</span> and we were out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and we started running and we walked all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So, from then on, the routine was, we walked at night and we slept during the day in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Food was not often. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Sometimes we would pick up apples so it must have been June, the late summer, it must have been the late summer because I remember also a lot of stubble on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> where we walked which meant they must have cut the <span class="DLF">crops</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Sometimes we would steal something if something was to be stolen and once I remember a peasant, a woman caught us while we were sleeping and the two women started talking to her and asking her for food and they offered her a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">One of the women had a ring and they offered her a ring and then she didn't come back and we were sure she was going to go and get the Germans or somebody and we were ready to leave and then she came back with some bread and cold boiled potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They never tasted so good, so we did get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">This whole trek was taking place because my step mother had a brother who was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and she was obviously trying to join him so I don't remember chronologically how long that journey took, but eventually we did meet up with that group in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , which was a very motley group. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">What I remember best was that her brother was very angry that she had a child in tow and it didn't pay to have children around and he tried various means to detach me of the group and dispose of me, but by then I had become very watchful and very clever about avoiding him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  You mean literally trying to kill you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, oh he would have definitely disposed of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I knew it, so I tried never to be left alone with him anywhere and with a group I knew I was a little safer because he couldn't very well start shooting into the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That became my life for a while living in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> it was full of escaped Jews from various camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Incidently later I thought that this camp was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> before they installed the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> because the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Reading in books and I didn't know it until there was a gathering of Holocaust survivors here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , quite a few years ago, ten years ago, longer than that and there was all kinds of books which Jim picked up, my husband, and reading up on it sure enough <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was to begin with a women's work camp, and then they installed the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , so we must have left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> escaped it just before it became really locked up and they started disposing of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So, we must have just come out, because the <span class="REGION">area</span> was right, and it was a fairly large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I remember that the gatherings of women there. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so it must have been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It wasn't just another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like the first one we were at. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, there we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and during the summer it was perfectly okay, and there was quite a motley crew in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They were escaped people from the Russian Army deserters, there were Poles in it, women, children, lots of young women all of them carrying around guns, and armed, which was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don't know where they got their guns really and several children. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and at night they went to raid the <span class="DLF">farms</span> and they brought food back, so we did have some food in those <span class="NPIP">places</span> really. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Never enough, never enough food and water was always a problem because the Germans were very often hunting us and if they had any suspicion if there was a group in the <span class="REGION">area</span> they would poison the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So, it was very-- we were told not to drink anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You had to be very cautious where you got your water. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The winter was very rough and they just kept on hunting the groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You know you never knew when you were going to be denounced by some people in the <span class="REGION">area</span> who had been robbed of food or such, and then set upon by the Germans, or the Poles more like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">There were more Poles than Germans at this point who were doing the hunting. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They were the Poles who were in uniforms, in those black uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">On one of those hunts they kept on driving us like you would hear shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">You would run in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> and they drove us out in a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> and when we got out in a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> we realized that they had machine guns set up on three sides of the <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Then they just opened fire and everybody war running back and forth and back and forth and on that particular hunt my step mother was hit and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I saw her die. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I literally saw her die. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">For some reason I escaped again. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">There weren't too many left of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Again, we retreated towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we stayed put until it was dark, completely dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Usually their favorite time of hunting was towards the end of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Then we sort of congregated together. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We couldn't drink because they poisoned the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">That's when I was really wounded because I had several bullet wounds from that and so did the other little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The other little girl was with us still. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don't remember any other children left except her and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Then they decided, the people who were left, that they had to -- we couldn't stay in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> the way we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">We were going to die, so they took both children to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and all I remember is that they brought out a peasant, mine was Polish speaking, I don't know what the other one was because I don't know where they took her because some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were Ukrainian speaking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and some of them were Polish speaking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They told him that he had to take me in and take care of me and if anything happened to me they would lock him and his family in <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and burn the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And they did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They used to do that, so he knew they weren't bluffing. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So, he carried me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they put me on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bread oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They would have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bread oven</span> and then around the corner on top there was a little knish like and you could climb into the knish and it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I must have been very sick because I remember very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I remember waking up and them feeding me some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I must have run a very high fever and then they told me at night they would put me there and then they said they couldn't keep me there during the day because they had two boys or three boys even and the neighbors would sometime come in, although not often. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There was very little traffic between the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sort of at the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I guess that's one of the reasons they picked that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So, they told me he was going to dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He was going to lift a couple of planks and dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and I would have to be there during the day and then at night they would come and get me and put me on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> to warm me up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That whole winter I remember that constant going back and forth between that little <span class="DLF">hole</span> where I was just sort of reclining. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It was just barely big enough to recline in and at night being taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I was completely stiff, and put on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> to thaw out. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It was pretty cold that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I couldn't make any noise either. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I wasn't supposed to make noise because if anybody came around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they might hear if any noises were coming out of there, so I kept very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I was sick a lot of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I probably was delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I don't know, but quiet, in a quiet way. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Then, the spring came and the peasants said to me you know during the spring the neighbors come and go and everybody 1s out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and if they know you are here they could easily tell that to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, they talked it over it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They were good people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They really were good people because they really sort of nursed me and they said what I should do is he was going to bring me part way to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and then I should walk to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They were going to provide me with some shoes and clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I didn't have any shoes or clothes by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I suppose they must have cut off my shoe because I had -- and I was going to have some shoes from the boys and they would give me some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">His wife was making me some clothes, and I was going to tell them that I came from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> and I needed to hire myself out because my family was too poor and could they take me in as a cow hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">That's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I walked to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and they hired me as a cow hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So, from then, what I remember is spending a lot of time in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> with the herd, driving the herd in the morning and staying in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and I was told very precisely which <span class="DLF">fields</span> they were to graze when because they didn't want them to just ruin the <span class="DLF">field</span> so you had to drive your cattle to one <span class="DLF">field</span> , let it graze a certain amount of time and when the sun was at a certain point you drove your cattle to another <span class="DLF">field</span> and come back at night and they attempted to teach me how to milk the cows which I wasn't too successful at the beginning, but I learned eventually, and assorted chores around the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , which I did and I stayed on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian speaking village</span> until the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I remember the Russians coming and being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were just as happy to get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">By then the Germans never put food there because they were somewhere else already so you hardly ever saw any Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Nobody was doing any hunting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They were such remote <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">There was no electricity, no <span class="DLF">sewers</span> , no water, nothing like that there, so they didn't bother. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">The safety lay in that they were so remote, those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I remember the Russians coming through, the Russians soldiers being stationed right outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I remember the guns going and I was told that that's when they had the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You could here the guns, all through the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They were those big that the Russians drove in. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">When they were all gone, that peasant came back and said now you can come back and live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, I went back to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they were pretty much decided that they were going to keep me. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They had boys and she wanted a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">She wanted to teach a girl how to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She needed somebody to help her how to make all the clothes and to spin, and actually I had learned how to spin in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> during the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I remember one winter when I was taught how to spin and how to sew also and how to weave. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They were completely self sufficient in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They made all their clothes, all their food, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So, I was with this Polish family and for all I knew that's where I was going to stay for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  I want to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> just before the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">You had said that you were not so close with your step mother, but clearly she seemed to have wanted to take you with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  I'm not sure really. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">She was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I think that one of the reasons she took me with her was because the women in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> chose the women with the children to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I think that was her ticket out, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I'm not sure she would have been one of the ones who would have been chosen to escape if it hadn't been that she had a child with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So, in a way, you know, we were mutually what's the word, necessary to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So, that's why probably she took me with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  But she also knew that her brother was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I don't know how she knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I don't know how she knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I have no idea how the information came to her but she knew he was there and we definitely had a <span class="NPIP">destination</span> when we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We weren't just ambling around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">They tried to walk in a certain direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Of course they didn't have maps or anything like that, but my guess was they knew their general direction which they wanted to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And my guess is they might have missed the group a couple of times and then finally met up with the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Now, you said her brother wanted to kill you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  But there were other children in the group also. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Do you think he didn't want any children there at all or was there something about your presence with his sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  I think it was my presence because I was a burden to him and his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You know, ina group like that you never knew how long you were going to stay with a group and those groups were forming and reforming all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You might leave one group. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">There were many of those groups roaming around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and he didn't know how long he was going to stay with the group and he obviously was going to take his sister and why did he need a child at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I remember them as being very young, both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So, I don't bear grudges. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">A child was a burden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Was this a resistance group as far as you could tell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Yes, indeed, some of them were resistance because I remember they would go off on missions at night to <span class="DLF">mines</span> somewhere and to blow up certain point so they were a resistance, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They were part of the resistance group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Did you have any particular job in this group, any kind of responsibility as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  I don't think I had a responsibility, but I seemed to acquired a peculiar what do you call it, a peculiar calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I seem to have an extra sense of when we were going to have the Germans descend on us in a hunt and I seemed to dream about my mother the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I have talked about it to some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It's a ridiculous thing to say that I had a premonition or something but some people interpret it as I probably I had extra good hearing and I could hear maybe hooves of horses or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> rolling somewhere and I could feel it because we all slept on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">That probably would trigger a dream where I was in danger and I would always wake up yelling and if I woke up yelling, everybody packed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So, I sort of became the mascot in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">You know people who are in danger, whose lives are in danger are extremely superstitious and anything that helps them stay alive they will clutch at. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">That wasn't as far fetched as other things when you're trying to stay alive and you really don't know where your next salvation will come with. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Esthy, you were explaining about this dream and your prophetic --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  Powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I don't really remember it that accurately, but I think the first time when I woke up, the <span class="NPIP">dream</span> , when I woke up I was yelling because I was frightened and I think the dream was, my mother, whom I knew was dead was chasing me and I didn't want her to catch me, and I was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">You know how you run in your <span class="NPIP">dream</span> and you're sort of slowed down, and then I realized that I had a scarf, so I took the scarf and I let it float behind me like a sail and I was sort of jumping from stone to stone and floating away while my mother was trying to catch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I was running faster and faster and I felt myself falling, and that's when I would wake up yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">That happened to me the first time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as far as I can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Of course someone was near me trying to put a hand on my mount to prevent me from yelling, and then everything around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was talked about and known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Wait one second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  So, they must have discussed it and they asked me what my dream was. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Somebody came up to ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">There was always a leader in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know, somebody was always a person whom they looked up to this was a man and he came to ask me what I had dreamt and I told him and he sort of listened and didn't say anything and then the next time it happened the woman woke me up, but this time she wasn't trying to stifle my yells. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">She just woke me up and I stopped screaming and she went and got the man and he came back and he asked me, and I told him it was the same dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So, he left, and very shortly after the order was given to break <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Usually an order would come and everyone would start packing up their immediate belongings and we started moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And from then on, ovariotomy I had the dream, we packed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we moved, so I figured it must have something to do with my dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Somebody once asked me whether I wasn't tempted to just sort of give false signals. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And I said absolutely not, believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I wasn't about to test anybody to give false signals because it could have been disastrous and then where would I have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I had to depend on the good will of others to survive and this was no way of doing it, so you didn't give false signals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  Did this give you a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I felt safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I felt much safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I felt for instance very often at night we went on long marches when we were changing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and from then on there was always somebody if I was lagging too far behind, somebody would pick me up for a while, sort of carry me around for awhile, carry me on, and then let me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Very often before I was afraid I was going to be left behind and from then on I sort of sensed that I wasn't going to be left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was going to be carried along if I faltered and if I stayed too far behind, which happened some times. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It wasn't intentional, but I was sometimes so exhausted and my feet hurt that I just couldn't walk anymore and I would fall behind, so it was sort of a helping hand that would come along and sometimes even two people would relay themselves and carry me for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So, my status definitely did change from then on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  What you didn't describe was how they connected your <span class="NPIP">dream</span> with a raid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Well, the next day there was a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">There was a raid after the first dream, and so the next time they obviously talked to each other and they decided to pack up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sure enough there had been a raid on that camp, because they sent back somebody and they found that the water had been poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They got to test the water from time to time on a dog or an animal they would test it. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">There was no other way of testing the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They decided there must have been a raid too because the water was poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So, from then on I became the lightening rod. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Is that the word for it? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">If I had the dream they would pack up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">As I mentioned that before when I checked with somebody the explanation that makes the most sense to me is that I must have had very good hearing, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I had excellent hearing and eyesight too, that I must have heard some vibrations on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Horses hooves or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> being rolled along and that might have set me off that there was danger coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">When you live with danger, even when you're very young, you often develop an extra sense about when danger is coming and where it's coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You really do, so that must have been my sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  What about clothes in this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">What were you wearing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Rags, whatever you could to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Feet were usually -- shoes didn't last very long or if they got wet they got too hard and you couldn't wear them so whatever you had you would wrap around your feet particularly if you had to march around at night because you were going through all kinds of terrain, like <span class="DLF">fields</span> that had been harvested and where the stalks are very hard to the soles of the feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Or pebbles or things like that, so you did the best you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You stole clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Very often they steal food, they stole clothes too. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was very hard to keep warm during the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">During the summer you didn't care really what you wore, but during the winter it was very hard to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I don't remember ever washing now that I think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We must have washed sometimes, but I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I guess it wasn't very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Do you remember getting thinner and thinner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  I don't remember noticing. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Probably I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Probably I was never very fat, but I don't remember noticing that I got thinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">No, I never really looked at myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">You never looked at yourself naked, well maybe I really thought of it I would have looked at the arms, but you tried to keep warm, you know, you try to keep bundled up. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">You don't notice whether you're getting thinner or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  Was there lice because people weren't clean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Yes, oh yes, absolutely lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I'm sure we were all covered with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I remember having lice when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They had to shave my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They shaved my head completely because I had lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I have a funny story to tell you about my shaved head but maybe I will do that later so that we do it chronologically. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Any other questions about that, about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  When you were caught and they were machine gunning you and you were shot, where were you shot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  I have four wounds on my left leg, two bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">One entered at a peculiar angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">One went through the leg and came out the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">One bullet went into my right breast and came out under my arm and that one must have touched a little bit long because I was spitting blood for a long time, so it must have touched the lung slightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  But you were nonetheless able to run and escape this and they didn't chase you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  No, because they were further away behind the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So they weren't chasing because they would have been caught in the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They weren't chasing. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They were just sitting behind the machine guns really. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They weren't chasing you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Nobody had anything to help you with the wounds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">As a matter of fact, I think they probably must have just put some rags on my legs and my other ones so there wouldn't be a trail of blood when they carried me to the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they had the farmer pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They must have bandaged it up with rags because it would have been too dangerous to have a trail of blood I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">When you get hit with bullets, you don't feel, unless it hits a bone or something like that, it takes a while for the wound to stiffen up and hurt really. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">At the beginning it doesn't hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea about how many people were in the group prior to this machine gunning episode and then how many after?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  It's difficult for me to tell because the group was -- there were people coming and going all the time, new arrivals, people who departed and went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and I really didn't have any sense of counting either. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">There were lots of people, but how many I couldn't tell, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  But obviously afterwards there were enough people that this farmer would take very seriously this threat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Well, they never knew because usually they would only send two or three people on any raid or on any mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You know, they wouldn't send too many people ever so he had no idea how many survivors there were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Were you frightened with this farmer at first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  I was too sick to be frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">By then I was really sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I must have gone into delirious state because I remember very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I just remember them feeding me something to drink or a little bit of food, some soup, some potato soup or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I couldn't even eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I don't remember being frightened because I was beyond that. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I thought I was truly dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I wasn't frightened by the peasants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  How long were you with this particular family before you went --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  Throughout the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I was there through the winter until that following spring when it became dangerous, when they were going to go out into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and when the neighbors were going to start dropping in and the boys were going to be in and out, it became too dangerous for me to stay there, so one evening, one night, he took me halfway and then he told me to stay in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> until day and during the day to walk the rest of the way to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and then --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  But you felt kindness from these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I didn't feel that they meant me harm, and I had developed a sense already who meant me harm, but they didn't, so I felt comfortable with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  And the boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  They were wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">They were wild, the boys, but when I left the boys had never seen me, remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I was hidden during the day and I slept at night <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and before day break he would come and put me back in the <span class="DLF">hole</span> so those boys never saw me until I actually came back from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They never saw me the boys, but I could hear them, you know, and they were wild boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Now was it common for young children to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Sometimes you would have a <span class="DLF">farm</span> which was particularly impoverished where they couldn't feed all the people that they had in their family and it was quite common for the youngsters to go an hire themselves out as cow herdsmen, whatever you want to call it, and for the older ones to hire themselves out as laborers, so that was not at all uncommon, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Nobody thought twice about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They told me what name, by what name I was called, and they told me the end name, which I have forgotten since, that I was to tell the people who hired me that I came from that <span class="DLF">farm</span> , which was their name so it would have been if they wanted to inquire it would have been -- but they never did anyhow because the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> the Ukrainians never talked to the Polish and the Polish never talked to the Ukrainians, so we were pretty safe that nobody was going to go in to inquire.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  Did they give you a picture or anything to take with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  No, no, they didn't give me a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I just went and but he used to drop in from time to time to come and see me so they knew that I had somebody to whom I was attached and it was obviously a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">You know, it was obviously a Polish peasant so they never thought twice about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Then when the war was over, he came back for me and he said he wanted, would I like to come back and live with his family and I said, "oh" and he said well, mother and I -- I think that's how he called her -- mother and I talked about it and we have the sons but we need a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Would you like to be the girl and I said sure, so I went back with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">She taught me how to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">She liked very much my sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I was a good seamstress, so they were quite pleased with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Were you pleased to go there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, I was very interested in what was going on in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I was fascinated by the seasonal business of the sewing and then the crops were growing and the planting of potatoes and the vegetables and taking care of the livestock and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I thought it was very fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I was fascinated also by the fact that they did everything themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Like they made their clothes and they built everything and when it came to the fall they would all slaughter together. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They came to help if they slaughtered a pig or a calf and then what they did with the meat and how they kept if for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I thought it was very fascinating, so I stayed there and I thought that was going to be my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I was still going to be -- obviously my job was going to do a lot of sewing and weaving because I seemed to have a knack for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">That was going to be my worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">It beat the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> let me tell you, so I had no complaints about that, plus the <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I always loved the <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , being out in the open, so that pleased me very much, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian village</span> were you still worried because the war was going on but by then did you have a sense that you were pretty safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  I was worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I wasn't sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I was worried, and life was hard in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They were violent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I never had a chance to see what it was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> before because I was always hidden but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian village</span> they were very, very violent like for instance the <span class="DLF">farm</span> I was on there was a mother and a son and the son when he got drunk he beat up his mother and he would beat up anybody and I learned how to run very fast because I made myself scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They beat up each other and they would get drunk periodically so it was violent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Were you ever beaten?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">He never caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">When he was sober he was okay, and I was out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> most of the time and I always did what I was told to do so there wasn't really any reason but when he was drunk he could have easily beaten me up, but I was always very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I could tell already when he was working himself up to a state of drunkenness where he was going to beat somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Did people talk about the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Hardly ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Mostly they talked about the daily work and what they were doing, and then while I was there on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> he got married and that was an enormous event because at Polish wedding, literally it is a Polish wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It takes place a whole week of festivities when there's a Polish wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">That was a lot of fun because everybody gets into the act. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So, I was -- but he beat his wife too. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It didn't take too long before he beat his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So, that was sort of interesting and that was a big event and ovariotomy a wedding takes places it's a big event in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">QUESTION:  How was your food intake at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  I ate like the peasants did. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We all ate together. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">In the morning there would be mashed potatoes and if we were lucky there would be a little bit of bacon that would have been fried and mixed into the mashed potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">IF there was a little bit of butter milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The butter we never had because that was taken maybe once of twice a year and they took butter and eggs you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They exchanged it, they bought it with other <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for necessities like plows and things like that, or seed. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">It was a very simple diet, but I don't remember being terrifically hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Bread was baked once a week and the bread was stored. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There was always meat from the slaughter that took place in the fall, and it was hung in that <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Bacon and sausages, blood sausages. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">A lot of blood sausages, I liked it too, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">During the summer there was alot of vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Cabbage, the potatoes were delicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Let's see what else, there was a white cheese which they made in the cloth from he butter milk which was very good, which mixed with potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Everything was mixed with potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Every once in a while a chicken died. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I killed one once unintentionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You had the chicken for the eggs so you often didn't kill the chickens but when a chicken wanted to sit on the eggs, the farmers lady would say to me just don't get in cold water for a little while, it will stop sitting on the eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Well I dunked it a little too much and the poor chicken just you know got too much of a dunking so we cooked the chicken of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Somebody asked me once, didn't you kill another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I don't think that would have went over too well if I had killed another chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, every once in a while there was some foul. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">A lot of meat from the pig. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">They mostly killed pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">They didn't kill calves because they needed them for the dairy products. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I don't remember any lambs at all on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">There must have been <span class="DLF">farms</span> that had lambs, but not in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was mostly cattle, cows and poultry. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Hens, and geese and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They would make a goose for Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The food was skimpy but enough to keep you healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I think people now a days would approve of a diet like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They grew a lot of fruit in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">There were apple trees and pear trees, small ones, the fruit was never large, but it was quite good, and cherries, yes, that's the main fruits that they had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  You weren't thirsty anymore?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  No, water, there was plenty of water there and everybody drank water. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">You drank something called , | believe, which was made from cabbage which had a slightly fermented tasted almost like apple cider only it was much sourer than apple cider. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Lots of cabbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We had lots of beats, lots of beats, lots of cabbage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Did you play at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">How could you play? </span><span class="sentence" id="628">No, there was no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Except I could sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I could sit in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> when I was watching the herds and the playing consisted of watching what was going on in a stream or birds, watching birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I loved to watch the birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Playing, there was nothing to play with really. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">What would one play with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Were there other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Because all the herds were kept separately and they would never graze together because each one of them had their plots and they would graze separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They would not graze together. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">There were children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but and sometimes they ran in a pack but I don't ever remember playing with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I think part of the reason might have been that they thought I was Polish and they were Ukrainian, so that was already it created a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They did not like each other, so they pretty much let me alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Did you think about particular thing when you were sitting there watching the herd, about what had happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  I kept on wondering about some of the people where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">That, I kept on wondering, where are these people now. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">That's mainly what I was thinking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Very often I was also very tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">You know you get up very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">You get up before the sun's up to get the herd out and when you come back and you have to do other chores, by the time you are -- during the day I was always tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">It took me a while to wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I would be out there, and it was cold also, and the June there was a slight frost even in the summer, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I spent a great deal of energy and thought on how to keep warm because I always seemed to be freezing in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I never had the right clothes for that, and I never had the right shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So, I would always try to figure out how to keep warm, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  Did you remain having dreams about your mother or did they stop after the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  They stopped after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They did stop after that, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I don't remember after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">From time to time I had them later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Usually when I was in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">When I felt myself in danger, I would have that dream, it would come back but usually it was because I was in danger in one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  So, then he brings you back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and you think this is going to be --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Then I got to know the boys who were very rowdy and I was sort of very sedate. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And the mother used to always protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">If they chased me too much I would always go and hide behind her and she would make a game of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">She like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">She liked having a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I thought that was going to be my life and it wasn't so bad, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So, I was there, and one day I came in and there was a couple, a man and a woman and the peasant said to me that they were people who had come they wanted to take me away and I said why. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So, they started explaining to me that they were Jewish people and they thought that they wanted to pick up all the Jewish children who were hidden in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They I remember they mentioned money that they would give some money and the peasant got angry and he said we don't want money. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">We want to keep her. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">By then I had been baptized and I had been given a little bit of catechism whatever you could get orally because I couldn't read or write, nor could they for that matter, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Everybody got it the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with them on Sundays, and I did not want to go back to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I felt I really was catholic and for some reason I felt like the Jews were really the ones who killed Christ, so I wasn't going to get mixed up with the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  And you had no recollection of coming from Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I probably came from a non practicing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that is why I have no recollection of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So, I don't remember how it ended but they left those people and the next thing I know we were working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">By then you know the spring was really advancing and we were working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and I liked to feed the chickens so I was always sent back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I would feed the chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I started feeding the chickens an | hear a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> drove up and here that man and that woman and she jumps down and she grabs me and she pushes me into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and off they ride with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I look back and the last picture I see is the peasants running after them shaking their fists and they drove off with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So, I was pretty miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I really felt miserable and they drove me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I don't remember much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> except for some reason, I don't know why, but when I see in those westerns, those make shift <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , I'm always reminded of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But anyhow, they drove me to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a collection center for children and I stayed with a family for a while in one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> consisting of a man who had lost his wife and married his wife's sister and his daughter and his wife absolutely doted on his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Every day she had a tutor coming in to tutor them in English because they were going to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They were waiting for papers to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And she was taking such good care of that girl and I kept on thinking wistfully God I wish I had someone to take care of me like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I felt really disoriented in that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I felt very homesick for the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and I felt very uprooted and I felt sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I just felt sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So, I don't remember too well that whole period except the next thing I remember, the next memory I have is being Bratislava, but I don't remember how we got there, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I have no recollection of how we got from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> was a stop off place and I got very sick there. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I don't know what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I must have had the measles or something, but I was very ill and most of those children left except for one girl whom you saw I have a picture of. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I don't know how long I was sick, but then other children started arriving and then we all were again a large enough group for us to continue and by small stages -- then I remember being on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> , and they got us out from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I think they probably must have gotten us through <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and the <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> we ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbizon</span> which is very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fountain Bleu</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It was truly beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">That's where I got my first orange. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">That's where I got my first taste of chocolate, and that's where they taught me to eat with a knife and fork -- not a knife, a fork. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">We started with a fork. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I don't think I ate with a knife for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">That's where they started teaching us things. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We were like savages really. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">That's when I had my head shaved because I was full of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I was also ill, I was quite ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I couldn't eat properly, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">My stomach wouldn't digest regular food. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I became very friendly -- it was so strange because the director of the camp was a man by the name of Eric Schott and he drove by and there was a group of us playing and he opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and he motioned for me to come into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where they lived which was on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , but it was very extensive grounds there, so he drove me to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they gave me upstairs I met his wife and his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">He had a son, and they gave me what you call in French , which is in the middle of the afternoon and they gave me little sandwiches with cheese and a piece of chocolate and some milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I thought that was absolutely delicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So, that was a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I have very good memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Once he asked me if I wanted to go and see what the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was like and I said sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I hadn't seen the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> in a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I remembered it from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we had, but he took his son and me to <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> for vacation for a whole week's vacation and it was absolutely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was for the first time I started eating certain fish which I had never had and shrimp and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I had never tasted anything like it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">That's when I rejoined civilized life, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">The older children in that group then left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> except for two, that little girl who stayed with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">She found an aunt and uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and she went to live with them, and I visited very often with them, and then when all the children had left, the director and his wife and their son moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I moved with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">That's when I really started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in earnest. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I had started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbizon</span> , but it was a <span class="BUILDING">one room school</span> with different grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">When we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I really started regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was very hard at the beginning because I didn't speak the language yet and I had to learn to read and write at the age of 11 and the French are very strict where they place you. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So, they immediately decided that I had to go into a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> with younger kids which wasn't very good for my morale. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">The first day that we had you know the spelling test, the teacher put my spelling on the board as an example of what not to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Twenty- three spelling mistakes, so I decided I had to learn fast, which I did, I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  Esthy, when they kidnapped you, were you screaming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Did they talk to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  They were just holding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">They said I had to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I had to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I belonged to the Jews and I had to come back amongst the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Oh, yes, I was screaming indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I was fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  Did you decide I have no power here, I will just take what coming as you did all the other things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">ANSWER:  I had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I really had no choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  Did you think about running away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Where was I going to run? </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Where would you run, you know, at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">If somebody fed you you stayed put because if you run who was going to feed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So, I wasn't going to run because I didn't know exactly -- I could have never found my way back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , never. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I was not going to be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I knew how violent the peasants can be, and I wasn't going to be caught somewhere like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So, running away wasn't an option really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  What point did you stop fighting or feel as if okay --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbizon</span> I sort of began to have a glimpse of another life. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">When we went away to <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> which I found absolutely beautiful, I particularly liked i 1 remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I have pictures with their son from with Rene, who was the son of the Schotts. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And, I began to have a glimpse of another life and then when I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I very quickly learned how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">When you're ready you learn it very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">You don't need several years like you have it here to learn how to read and write when you're really of a certain age and you're really motivated. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So, I learned how to read and write very quickly and I learned French very quickly and I started reading a lot and that opened up to me a whole new world once I started reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I knew now that maybe it wasn't so bad what happened to me, and I absolutely loved <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I found <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Everywhere I looked -- the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> I just couldn't get enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I used to just wander around by myself everywhere and it was safe at the time to wander around anywhere you wanted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I thought that that was the most glorious <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that I had ever seen which it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I was pretty happy by then and I was adjusting very well, and I was learning lots of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I was going through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I became very good at writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I was writing poetry in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I always found teachers who were always helpful and always pushing me along. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It became very challenging to me and very stimulating not to disappoint them, you know, that the French are very big on competitions and regional tests and this and that, and I became a regular at the various competitions in writing and such because all of them wanted to send me because obviously I had a gift in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So, I began to really enjoy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I had to work very hard, because the French school system at the time was very difficult to get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">It was very challenging and I had a lot of work to do and a lot of catching up to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">It was ridiculous, I remember doing calculous and they discovered my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">multiplication table</span> or my additions. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And we didn't have little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">calculators</span> at the time and you really had to be able to calculate and I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So, somebody would always step in to coach me so I would have several weeks of coaching in addition to the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They were sending me for competition in essays and they discovered that I didn't know the rules of grammar in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I had skipped the grade where there were rules of grammar so I had a tutor assigned to me from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a couple of weekends to teach me what the rules of grammar were. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">You needed to know the rules of grammar when you off to a writing competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So, I was very busy and I was very caught up in that life, and I really enjoyed it very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  You felt close to both Mr. and Mrs. Schotts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  I felt very close to Mr. Schott. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Mrs. Schott, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Mrs. Schott was a bit of a basket case and a difficult woman, although I couldn't blame her after she lost her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Honey died when he was --I was -- how old was I when he died? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">13 or 14, and he must have been 17 years old and he died of cancer, a young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So, that was a very terrible blow to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  Were you close to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  I was very close to him, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He was very protective of me, and I was delighted to have a big brother who was protective of me, so I felt very close to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I felt very close to Mr. Schott, in fact, I named my son after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">My son is named Eric after Eric Schott. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And I got to know his family in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I became very close with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He had a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and I became very close to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">In fact, I still see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Unfortunately he died, and his nephew died a couple years ago, but we spent some time before he died together because they were very important people in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I made friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I was doing lots of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  So you put your life together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I really did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">QUESTION:  Did you consider yourself a member of the Schott family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  Up to the time when he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">After that I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">After that I had a whole series of <span class="NPIP">places</span> I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">She wanted to remarry and after all to have a young girl on her hands was not the best thing for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So, I went to live with a friend of theirs who was my tutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Eric Schott was my tutor first, and they appointed an assistant to him in case something happened to him, and when he died, I went to live with that other family by the name of Katts, and they were a terrible family to live with. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They really were. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Actually, I don't think he particularly picked on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">They had two sons and he was equally cruel to his two sons, so it was not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I stayed with them until I reached the age of 18 at which point in the <span class="BUILDING">French court</span> , you can be declared mature of age if two witnesses will testify to your character and your maturity, which is exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So, I became essentially 21 at the age of 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">From then on I could do as I pleased and I went to live with a family of two doctors who had been at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbizon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">They were taking care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They weren't married, the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">They lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">She had a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Her husband had been deported during the war and killed and I lived with them until I married Jim. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I met Jim in the summer of 1954 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He was stationed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , and I was visiting with this family became they had gone back to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he was a doctor and he couldn't practice in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">The French medical association is very reactionary and very tight and they wouldn't allow him to practice so, since he took his medical degree in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> where his family was a doctor and he opened up a very thriving practice, so she had to join him there and I lived with the daughter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and during vacation time when we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> and stay with them and then come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> resumed. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">One of the trips in '54 I met Jim, who was in the United States Army, and I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and he went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but two years later, he came back and we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So, we were married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">QUESTION:  You corresponded during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Jim is not really a letter writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I know he can hear me. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Telegrams mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">He sent me telegrams, and also I must say my English wasn't very good, so it was hard to correspond when your English is not very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  So, did you take these people's name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Lehman, yes, I took their name, that's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  So you were married --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We were married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , but then when we came here, his parents wanted a wedding too, so we had a second wedding for his parents, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I didn't know anybody and it was very funny because whenever I was introduced to somebody and we would turn around to somebody else I would hear, is she Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="840">At one point I said to Jim why don't you make a sign and put it on my back, I'm Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  Were you taught anything about Judaism after the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbizon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Yes, as a matter of fact, I was in a very peculiar way. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">You see, in order for me to catch up with the French school system I had to go into a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> for a while to catch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And it so happened that I was sent one year to a very special <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> which was not Jewish and one year I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> which was Jewish, and the only way they would keep me there is if I would learn how to read and write Hebrew right away, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We had religious instruction and we read the Bible every day in addition to the regular curriculum, so I learned about Judaism there, as much as you can learn in a couple of years, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I learned how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I learned even how to read , which I cannot do any more, but if I had to, I probably would again, I would learn it, if my future life depended on it, I would probably learn it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So, I did learn a little bit about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It didn't take. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">It really didn't take. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I think that the first time I really felt Jewish was after the Six Day War. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">That's when I really felt Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I don't quite understand why except that maybe I saw the Jews stand up and fight and that did it forme. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">They were defending themselves and they were defending their <span class="REGION">land</span> , and for the first time I felt Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So, I feel perfectly Jewish now, but I didn't for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I really didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  What does that mean, do you think, feeling Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  Feeling that I'm proud to be part of that breed. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Feeling that in spite of all the trials that we have gone through we are a very strong and resilient people, not feeling that I'm ashamed of being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">That's what it means essentially to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I can't say that I'm really religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It's just that I feel very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I really do at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I feel that I'm part of this minority, and I'm going to stay that way and I'm going to tell my children about it and I hope my children stay part of the minority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  Is there a piece of the child in you feeling angry about what Jews did or didn't do during this period of time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  I think, yes, there was a certain amount of anger in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">There was the anger of our marching off like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I was very angry about the, but I have come to understand that we really didn't have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">We were trapped and we really didn't have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">But I did feel angry for a long time, you're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And I think that's probably why I didn't feel Jewish because I didn't want to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I was angry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But the Sixth Day War showed me that if there was a way, the Jews can fight, you know, and they will fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">That made a big difference to me really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  You're identity is something that you've created in a way that most people don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  Don't most people create an identity for themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION:  Yes, but you have a history that is lost to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  That's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Well, I had no choice really. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I had to create an identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">You're right. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I did create an identity for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I didn't realize it was that unusual though. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I thought most people created their identities, no?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  But your history is one of so much oppression and so much terror as a child that you couldn't be a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  No, I guess I was always adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I guess I was always adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  What was it like for you to raise children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  It wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">You know the best way of understanding another person is to put yourself in their shoes and I am very good at putting myself in the shoes of adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I couldn't put myself in the shoes of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">As a consequence I was probably very over protective of my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I was always trying to keep them safe, which doesn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I have come to certainly realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">You can't keep anybody safe, but part of the reason was that I didn't remember what it was as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I couldn't venture out as a child because it was too dangerous, so consequently I probably tried to keep my children from straying somewhere where there might be danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And I know that I had peculiar fears like if they had a rash it used to drive me crazy until I realized that it had to do with that little girl that that was shot because she had pimples. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I associated pimples always with being sick and if you're sick you're going to get shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So, my kids never had a rash I can tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I drove them crazy but they didn't have a rash. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">You know, it's things like that that I probably overdid as a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But for a long time my children didn't know my past, which is again, I'm told, I didn't realize but I'm told that this is not usual with survivors of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I remember the first time my daughter came back from <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> and they were talking about the Holocaust and she asked me point blank are you a Holocaust survivor, and I said yes, and she got very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">By then I think she must have been 10 or 11 years old which is an advanced age and she never had a glimmer that I might be a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">So, you know, it's --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  Did you then tell her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  Some, but then I wasn't able to talk about it all so I was very reticent and that probably created more anxiety than if I had told her. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Our son never questioned me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">He's the kind of a child probably that I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">He absorbed things by observing. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">He doesn't ask that many questions so he just absorbed and watched and didn't ask too many questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">My daughter is a real questioner. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">She likes to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Some of the answers I gave weren't entirely satisfactory. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Part of the reason was I wasn't able to talk about it then, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">It didn't come until much later when I was able to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I just sort of decided this was my past life, another life. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I was living in a different life and I was going to pretend I'm just as normal as everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So, that's really the mission I took on. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I was going to lead a normal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  Did you imitate other mothers that you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And also, I had an instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I have a protective instinct to begin with so I would never do any harm to a child, so I'm very protective of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So, that's -- and I read so I understood some of the things that were going on, and I did let go of the children, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Maybe not as fast or as soon as they wanted it to happen, but it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">No, I understood suffering so I was always trying to nurture and avoid suffering, but I suppose that I must have brought certain hang ups with me that other mother's didn't have, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  Maybe we should bring the pictures over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Why don't you explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">ANSWER:  This picture was taken, it doesn't show my finger, is that okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">This picture was taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> in 1946, and I am the girl in the middle next to the white bunny and the little boy who leans on my right arm we call him the Englishman because nobody could understand what language he was talking, which he spoke in. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">We all had a smattering of different languages, but nobody understood his. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So, that was the Englishman leaning on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  So you're second to the left there in the first row?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  I'm second to the left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Do you remember the other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  No, I just don't remember them, except for that little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">He was always next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">He was always leaning against me, but he didn't speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">He never spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I never heard him speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">This picture also was taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> and that's the whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">You can see it's a pretty large group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  Where are you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  There I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">That's the one, that's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Around time, that was taken around the same time I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Same hat, same coat, I didn't have any more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Maybe somebody who knows <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> will recognize the monuments, but I don't remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I know it was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , although we were also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , but I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">This picture I'm the one holding on to two hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  So you're this person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  That's me, that was taken later. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">That was taken in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">By then you can tell my hair had grown back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I had my head shaved when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and by then it was growing back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I forgot to tell you a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Mrs. Roosevelt came to visit the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I was designated to learn by heart The Raven and to recite The Raven to her, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">When I was finished she patted me on the head and said, "What a cute little boy." </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So that was my first meeting with Mrs. Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I met Mrs. Roosevelt later on because my husband and I started a Reformed Democratic Club when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and she came to be our speaker and Jim and I went to pick her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I told her the story when I first met her and she looked at me and said, "My you have changed." </span><span class="sentence" id="964">So, those were my encounters with Mrs. Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  Thank you so much Esthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span>
