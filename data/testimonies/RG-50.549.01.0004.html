<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I would like to start with where you were born, and when, and what your name was at birth, and what your name is now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay, that's easy enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My name was Renata Goodman, and today I'm Irene Hizme.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  You did not stay very long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you born in, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I guess about three or four years, and I have a twin brother by the name of Rene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Where did you go after you left your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">birth town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  We went with my mother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Razenstadt</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We were sent there and I think we were there -- I don't really recall how long, but in 1943 we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  I would like to go back just a little bit to clear -- you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> first, and lived there for a little while, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I think we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We were born in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tetraslifkanov(ph</span> ).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Could you give me a sense of your family a little bit? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">You mentioned a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Do you have other siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  No, but there was a father, and my mother and Rene and I and my memories are not very vivid, but we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , upstairs, because I remember because I used to watch the <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> , and it had the number 22 on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Do you remember whether your brother and you were close?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We were each other's friends, playmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We always played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I don't remember ever socializing with any other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Did you know that you were twins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Just that we belonged to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Do you recall your parents at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Not very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I just recall moments of things we sometimes did together, and I remember we used to go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> together with my dad and my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But my dad was- one night there was a big commotion and some men came in and they took him away, and I just remember my mother was crying and we also were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It just was a terrible memory for me, and we never saw him again after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother, I remember in particular, she used to play a game with us at night -- at least I'm the one that wanted to play this game. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I wanted her to set us up, hand positions and to think that we could sleep that way the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  The memory of your father being taken away, was that the earliest memory that you now know had to do with the Nazi occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  I'm not sure if that's -- I don't think I knew it had to do with anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">To me life was the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I always -- there was a feeling that my parents were not happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was something going on, but of course I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I didn't feel anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I didn't understand about my father being taken away, and I don't think my mother really explained it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I think we always felt that he was going to come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Do you remember soldiers taking him, or 1s it just a memory of him being taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  It was some men. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I don't know if they were soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Do you recall anything in particular about that night, anything more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Not really, not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  When you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , what do you remember getting there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Well, I remember that we went on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it was quite nice, I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Then we were just in a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  You were together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I was together, Rene and I and my mother, and I don't have a clue to what we did during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> are really very vague except again, just for moments here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I remember cobblestone <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I remember watching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> with dead bodies, but it didn't mean anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I didn't understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was with Rene, and I was with my mother and so it was fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  You don't remember any kind of activity that you did there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  I really can't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  You do remember music from there sometimes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Yes, there was music, concerts, sitting in an audience and watching some kind of presentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Yes, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I think that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  You had to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Yes, that was when -- it was December '43 and it was a very cold night. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was snowing and there was snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and I remember it seemed like we had a long walk, a very long way to get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We were walking with my mom who was carrying a suitcase and she said we were moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I remember that on this walk it was a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It was not just us and there were soldiers and there were dogs barking and every once in a while there would be a gun shot, and I think people were dropping-- falling down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I don't really think I understood that they were killed or that they were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I know I didn't want to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I just wanted to stop and sit down, I was so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My mother just kind of pushed me on and said you must come. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You must be still and just walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The next thing I knew we were on this very crowded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was not like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we had taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was just <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> and you were squeezed very tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">People were crying and moaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">People had to -- I don't recall having any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I remember we were hungry and it was so tight you really had hardly <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to breath and I was little so all I can remember is legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Even though Renee was there and my mother, but I remember being scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Do you have any sense of how long -- how much time was spent on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It seemed very long, but I don't know what the ride really is even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I've never asked anybody how long is it from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but 1t seemed endless. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">When we finally -- when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> finally stopped and we got out, and we walked again for a while to this big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> like structure, whatever and it had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> like thing down the center and that was our new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  What happened when you got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , do you remember in more detail what the procedure was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Not too much actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I just know my mom was holding on to us, and we just followed her and many other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We were all going to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Do you remember getting tattooed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  It's a very vague -- very vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I wish I could recall it better. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I do vaguely remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  What are your memories then of this place of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Well, --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Did you stay together at first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  In the beginning we were together and it was also with many other Czech families. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I just remember it was just very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I used to see people get hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I know we were hungry almost all the time, and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">There were soldiers and I really didn't understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We had to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting for things and every once 1n a while my mom took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the doctor to look at us and I remember the very first time, especially because Rene -- I always felt he was a crybaby and I was afraid that he was going to cry, and I knew that if he cried something terrible might happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I went first and to be examined and I was -- I didn't utter a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The whole time I kept hoping that Rene was going to be good too, because I didn't want anything to happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, we went with our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I also -- before we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I remember there was one time where I remember we sat with our mother and we were being photographed, and I remember that particular moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">As it turns out we subsequently learned those were actually propaganda photographs that were sent out, and I have the picture today of Rene, my mother and I in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  What was it about that moment that makes you remember’? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Is there anything particular about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Well, we were kind of like on stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I think they kept saying smile, but we really didn't feel much like it, but what I remember was being like close to my mother, feeling her coat and just the closeness of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  But you could not stay together for very long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No, at some point -- I know now it was six months afterwards we were separated from our mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I remember it as being physically really taken from her, and I definitely remember a scream from her and I remember her getting hit by a soldier or some person and I just remember really -- it was very, very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I just somehow knew I'd never see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Well, in fact that is what happened because the entire lager was killed that night, and also not only was I separated from my mom, but then Rene and I were also separated because we were -- though we were twins, we were of the opposite sex, so they didn't keep twins of the opposite sex together. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So, Rene was put in with twin boys, and I went in with the twin girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did you know where he was? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Were you aware of him being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  I think throughout the whole time that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I always felt in my heart that Rene was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I had a vague idea where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> it was a little over to the right near some <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> or something, and in fact he really was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That's how I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was once some kind of a fire and I was terribly scared that Rene's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> may be caught up in that, but luckily he wasn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Did you see him sometimes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, I don't recall that I saw him, although Rene says that he did once catch a glimpse of me, so, it's possible that I saw him too, but it didn't quite register for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But somehow I always knew at some point no matter what this was, and I didn't understand what any of this was, that we'd somehow be together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You asked earlier about memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I guess most of them are really quite bad and I don't like speaking of them very much and I haven't spoken about some at all and I might never because I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the things that I remember very clearly is having to stand for hours for roll call, and I remember that I was one of the youngest and I was little and I always tried to hide behind somebody else, somebody taller so that I would not be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I think this was my mode of operation, is to be invisible and you can't get into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I used to get a piece of bread, usually int he morning, with some black stuff to drink and I remember that I would always, since I was always -- maybe it was in the afternoon -- because I was always hungriest in the morning so I thought it would be really clever for me to try to save this piece of bread so I would have it the next day and of course it usually was gone and I didn't understand it but now in retrospect I think the rats and mice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> must have loved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They knew who to come to. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I remember standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> , humiliated standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the cold naked waiting to get into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and also terribly scared because somehow I knew that you didn't always come out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I didn't know quite what happened, but I knew you didn't always come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I'm amazed at my, I guess call it chutzpa, because I had a locket on my neck, a gold locket from my mom and I was determined to hang on to this and of course if they had seen it, I don't know what would happened to me, but I took it off my neck and held on to in my hand and somehow got passed the guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I think what happened is in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> it finally dropped out of my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But there was a little bit of me that said I got away -- I saved my locket. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I remember once that I actually hid among dead bodies and I don't know exactly what was going on but I thought if I really lay still and make believe I was dead I would somehow escape whatever was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There was always this cloud of smoke in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and there was always this smell that after a while I heard comments you know they're burning people. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It's flesh burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I don't think I still understood exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I said, you know, it couldn't be. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I think my most horrendous memories are those of Doctor Mengala and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I seemed to be a favorite candidate. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I don't know why but I remember getting injections and I remember having some little surgeries here and there, and things with electrical wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I spent a lot of time in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was pretty sick very often, but somehow I held on because I knew that Rene needed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I had to get by.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  How did you know it was Doctor Mengele?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't really think I really knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I think I know that today. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was just a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It just seemed like he was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mean to me he was like in charge of everything, next to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  You were alone there from your family, but did you relate to other women? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Do you remember women of different ages? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">What was the relationship between you and the others you were with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Unfortunately I think I really for whatever reason, I had no relationship with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I was a very quiet child, very introverted. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I didn't mingle. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It didn't seem like there were any children my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They were a little bit older, and I somehow didn't belong and so I found myself just being kind of an observer. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I watched a lot and I always again tried to make myself invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Always get behind somebody tall, behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , behind whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">One very, very sad experience for me was one night when I had to actually go to the latrines and somehow I got so totally disoriented that I just could not remember where my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> was and I remember trying to just -- I remember it was almost dawn and I knew that if they found me I'd be in real trouble so I tried to just get into anybody's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and maybe it was the people or the times but I was just being pushed away and being told this is not your <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">This is not your <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but finally there was one woman and I don't know who she is, she finally said -- just grabbed me and let me come in with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I missed my mom a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  So, you did not have an experience that other women have had of women taking care of each other a little bit in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I also know that twin girls also had camaraderie because they had their siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But I think my overwhelming sense was just loneliness. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I felt that I was just alone, always all alone and didn't belong anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  How did you get through those days? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Did you talk to yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You had to do something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Well, I think I day-dreamed a little about -- I don't know exactly about what. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I think I used to remember that I had a doll and I had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the toys I used to have, little building blocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I remembered my mom and I used to remember the walks in the <span class="DLF">park</span> with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I think that's how I got through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Were you ever beaten?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Not that I -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">No, but I did witness other people being beaten, and I witnessed people being shot and people running into the electric wire, <span class="DLF">fences</span> , but no, I tried to keep out of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I had a sense that I had to be really good and listen and obey and I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  What happened when finally liberation came and the Red Army came? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Do you remember that particular day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Well, what I remember is that there was a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Suddenly there was a difference in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I don't think that I understood that it was liberation day because I don't think I understood that we were at war. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">To me, I guess I always hated that the saddest thing is that I really thought that what I had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was the way everybody lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">This was life, but there was a change, a definite change. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">There was a lot of scurrying about. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Things weren't as strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">There seemed to be -- there was no order suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There was just no order, and at that time I was extremely sick and I was lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I could not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I think if another week had passed I probably would have been dead, and I just remembered that a Polish woman picked me up and she piggy-back carried me all the way to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That's what happened to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  So you were very weak then, very sick, then when they came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Right, and I saw people running here and there and there was some kind of shouting. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It seemed there was a little almost joy like something good happened, but I couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So, I was just wondering what was going to happen to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  So, this woman carried you to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that's where you stayed for a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Yes, she lived right in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> proper of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I remember being in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I remember -- 1t must have been a doctor who came to see me and I remember these hot glasses on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">A lot of that, and eventually I guess I got better because I got enrolled in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I knew that she was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I also somehow knew that I was Jewish, but Jewish was not good, and so I wanted very much to be catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">That was fine with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  How did you communicate with her? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">She was Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  I think I very quickly learned how to speak Polish because I had no trouble in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I had no trouble in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I understood everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So, maybe as a child it was easy for me to pick up the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  How did you communicate in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Did you understand people there? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">What languages do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  I have to be honest, I don't think I spoke to anybody, but I understood everything that was being said because I think that I did speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">My dad and mom were originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and that's where we were born, but I believe we spoke German, because I still understand some German today, so that's probably true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Can you describe a little bit the new life that you had there at this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Did she have other children? </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Did she want to know what had happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Actually in retrospect now it was probably very peculiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">No, she did not want to know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She had no other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">There was a man who would come and be there every once in a while, but I don't know exactly what he was to her or not to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I had a very strict regiment that I had to follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I had to take care of bunny rabbits and sometimes she served these bunny rabbits and I didn't want to eat them but I had to because if I didn't I would get hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">She was very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">When she enrolled me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she knew exactly how long it should take me to walk <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and if I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> two minutes late, I'd get hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">With all of this, 1t was certainly better than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I did get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was outside in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I had to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , set the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and do various other chores. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I don't think she ever hugged me or kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">In the summer time she had some family living outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we would make this very long journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It seemed like a couple of hours worth, to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and there there were some children, and all I can remember is that they made fun of my number and nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I cried because I wanted to be catholic and they were telling me I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I surprising did very well at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But it was not -- there was no love in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but she obviously -- she fed me, she clothed me and she expected certain things from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The gentleman who frequented the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at times-- I didn't understand then, but I think he had a drinking problem, and if I was in the way of his temper then I got it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  He would hit you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I think I must have been with her for at least a year, perhaps a little longer, because I remember Christmas, and I remember her telling me if I was very, very good I would may be get a present from Santa who was going to come out of the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Of course I believed her and I stayed up all night looking for this Santa who never came, and so I decided I must be really bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Did you get a present?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I did get a cookie from somebody, a gingerbread cookie. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">That was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Did you eat it or did you save it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  No, I saved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  So, nobody during that time--, you stayed there for about two years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  I don't think it was that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">A little over a year I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Nobody ever asked you what happened and when the children made fun of you, what did they say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  They were saying something about me being Jewish and that I was a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I really didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It so happened that at the time that I was with this woman, the Russians had occupied this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and almost diagonally across from her is where the Russian soldiers were living, or maybe it was an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And I do remember that she used to send me to there with some kind of packages, which I really don't know what any of this was, but I have to say that the Russian soldiers were very nice and very loving, and I liked going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The other thing that is very hard for me to talk about even now 1s one of the things that she used to take me -- we used to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we would sift through the remains, ashes and look for gold teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">She used to give me a sieve and I had to with a spoon or whatever had to pile it up and shake it and of course I had to find at least one piece of gold otherwise I was going to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, I had to be a busy little beaver there, but the feeling that I knew that what I was doing was something so not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I felt like I was -- even though I was young and didn't understand, I felt like I was touching something that shouldn't be touched and that this was not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But we went looking for gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Do you have any nice memories of that lady, anything that has to do with warmth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Well, I have to say, and this might sound strange, but I loved going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> because it was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The <span class="DLF">windows</span> , the statues, the music. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I only wanted to know when I was ever going to get called up for the -- to get that little wafer that looked so wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But I never got it, I never got called up, but I loved going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  So, you wanted to be catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Then one fine day, I didn't know at that time, but now I know that it was Vahasala (ph), a Jewish organization, and there were other children in <span class="BUILDING">Polish homes</span> and they were rescuing them, and one fine day I found myself, I was told that I was going that I had to leave and that I was going to go someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It probably will sound bizarre but I was actually sad that I was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Not that it was wonderful, but it was the only <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I had and it was certainly better than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I wound up in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> and there I met a girl, a few years older than I, and she kind of became my mother figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Her name is Miriam and we are friends to this day, and she is the only person I spoke to for about two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I never spoke to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I hated this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was not organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was sloppy, not neat, nothing ever was on time. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I remember looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> with Miriam -- she also was not too happy-- and we kept thinking how we could escape as we were holding our rosary beads, how we could escape from this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish place</span> and get back into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I was just really very unhappy, very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I wanted to go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  But Miriam was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Yes, Miriam was Jewish, but she was like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">She was also indoctrinated at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We thought we were doing our rosaries and saying our little things and --. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Then we were moved again, and this time we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to another <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and there were a lot of children at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was somewhat better because I guess there were more children and not so many adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But, again, I felt out of <span class="NPIP">place</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I would listen as many of the children relate their tales of what happened to them and how they got to be here, and many of them were hidden by catholic or non Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Some of them still had relatives and parents and were just waiting to be reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Some had hidden with the partisans in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and some had been housed I think actually by ministers and clergy. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I was the only child with a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">In fact, I was the only child from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So, when I heard all the stories that were being told, I said, they're never going to believe where I was and I never spoke about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I never spoke about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Nobody asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The adults didn't ask and I only spoke to Miriam. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I was Miss Goody Two Shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I had to be the best at everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We had lessons and classes and I was the top student. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I did everything well, to perfection. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was sickening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  Why did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  I think I wanted attention and I think I thought if I was the best I'd get more attention some how. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It was to the point where when the entire -- all the children were vaccinated and that really hurt and every body was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Not me, I was up early, I was bringing breakfast to everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Not that my arm didn't hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It hurt just as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I had the same fever everybody else did, but no,I had to show that I was above this. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">An injection wasn't going to get me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I remember when a lot of us when we got there we had these sores on our bodies, I think scabies or whatever and we had to every day go and get medication to put on this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Sometimes the children would wince and cry, but not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Miss Perfect here never cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I needed nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But I was crying the whole time <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I was so lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I just desperately wanted somebody just to hug me, just to hug me, and I didn't know how to go about getting somebody to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But Miriam became sort of my surrogate mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">She used to do my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I had these long curls and --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  Did you tell anybody that you had a brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Did you tell the woman in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Her name was Mrs. Mucha and no I never told her and no I never --
QUESTION:  Did you tell Miriam?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  I think I might have told Miriam and I guess in the search after this I did find an aunt in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I was not searching but who ever was doing this who actually 1s my mother's sister and she was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with her husband and a son, a young son, about my age, and she was asked if she wanted to take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I guess it was a hard time for her because she said no, things weren't good and she already had a son and a husband and she didn't think she could handle another child. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">She knew we were twins so --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Before I ask you the question about Rene you said that you had long, long curls. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Did you like yourself at all then? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Was it important to you to look nice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  It seemed to have been important in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I don't know if I liked myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I think I thought I was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I must have been bad because all these terrible things had happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">If I had been good, none of this could have happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I guess a little childish reasoning there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  So, what happened after? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">You and Miriam did not go together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">What happened was, as I said, some children they found <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Some were actually blessed enough to be reunited with family, and then a lot of them were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was the beginnings of Aliat Israel, and Miriam was slated for that, and I thought I would be as well because I wanted to go with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But I was told by this gentleman who used to come to visit us at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fluebane</span> that he was going to take me to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Lucky me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I wanted to go with Miriam. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She was the only person who I felt close to and so this very nice gentleman said to me, well it will only be for a little bit and we'll bring you right back. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I believed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The next thing I knew was I was together with another little boy who was selected from another <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We were on this big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> on the way to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Nobody explained about a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We had -- they sent a young woman with us who spoke only French. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The boy spoke only French. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Didn't understand a word of French, barely. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I mean I know that we were in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but we always, the children we spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I thought a thousand times this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> was going to blow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I had no idea what a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> even was, but we did finally land. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Then, it turned out there was a lot of commotion about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Subsequently, I learned that we were chosen to raise money for the war orphans of Europe by this organization called Rescue Children, and I guess we were quite successful because they did raise quite a bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We stayed at <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and I saw white bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I saw things that were totally magical to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We were taken to this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , this <span class="DLF">Sax Fifth Avenue</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnwitz</span> , I don't remember -- <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> of -- I could not believe my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They bought us things and they gave us things. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was unbelievable, unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But I have to be honest, I only wanted to go back and be with Miriam and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and all these extraneous things, the teddy bears, the dolls, the chocolate didn't mean anything to me, even though it was exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">When it came time to ask well when am I going back, this very nice gentleman said to me, we're not sending you back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  How did you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I was very, very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">There was a very loving and caring family by whom I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It was a temporary arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I thought I was staying permanently however. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">She had a son and she was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, I think, around that time, and I thought that this was going to be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I quickly learned English and Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I don't know how, but within -- well, I just first started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with them, but then it turned out --
QUESTION:  You thought that you would stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  I thought, but it seemed that it was really just a temporary arrangement and they were trying to place me. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">There was a family that was interested in me, but they wanted to try me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So, I was invited to spend shobot with them, and they had a little girl that was about a year younger than me and a boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He must have been about four or five years younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I spent Shobot there and I was very uncomfortable the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They thought that I would be a good playmate for their daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">There was only one problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I didn't know how to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I had never played. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">She had lots of games, lots of dolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I really didn't know what to do with this stuff and I was again, I was very introverted, very quiet, not at all talkative, not at all bubbly. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It just happens that the little boy also came with me for that Shobot and he was exactly the opposite of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">He was extraverted, bubbly, cute, a child anybody would want. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So, when they brought us back, I guess they must have told these people that well, I didn't quite work out, but they'd be very interested in the little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So, that is what in fact happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So the search was on to find me a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I think at that time, I did tell Eva Best, who was the woman, that I had a twin brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Her husband, who was at that time the director of Rescue Children, started making inquiries. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They also found a wonderful, wonderful family who had originally wanted to adopt a boy and were thinking that they were going to get Charlie who when they were told that the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they thought was for me didn't quite work out, would they be interested in a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It seems now that she has a twin brother, would they be interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So, this was more than they ever anticipated or expected, but they said certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We'll be happy to take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And they did come to see me and they had seen me and they knew that I was introverted and shy. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I never said hello to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I never looked at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They were up to the challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So, very shortly after that, Eva Best took me over to Mr. and Mrs. Myer Slatkin who eventually adopted me and Rene, but that's a whole story, but I was not happy in the beginning because again, I felt like I had been given away again. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">This was the Polish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , it was the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and now it was this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It seemed like nobody really wanted me and I only wanted to keep going back to Eva Best and I know that my mom though, she tried real hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She bought me things. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">She tried to get me involved in going shopping and things, but I only wanted to go back to Eva Best. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It took quite a long time before I got really used to being with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I continued in the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they were exceptionally loving to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I started in the third grade in I think December and I think by March and April I was in fifth grade with children my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">To the credit of my mom who worked really hard with me on English. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Hebrew I was on my own because she didn't know Hebrew, but I seemed to have done well. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">In fact, I excelled at Hebrew and they had a lot of patience. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Slowly, slowly, I realized that this was going to be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and when they heard that I had a brother they right away got busy looking for him and they spared absolutely no expense and believe me, lucky they had it, but they spent thousands of dollars to find Rene and to be finally able to get him here. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But the one thing all through this is nobody ever asked me "What happened to you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Nobody ever asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Nobody ever wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  What time was that now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  This was -- we're about 1948, December '47, 1948 January, with the Slotkins now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Yushiva</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It followed the traditions of what I had learned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fluebane</span> , because that was also run by an Orthodox group. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I felt that I had a great need to excel and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I graduated at the top of the class and won a scholarship in eighth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  You just talked about the great need to excel that you even got a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Where do you think that great need came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  I think because I felt really that I must have been bad to have so many horrible things happen to me that I wanted to prove to my new parents that I was worth adopting and that they could be proud of me, that I could be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I think that was my need. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Of course, I have to say that perhaps it wasn't so hard to excel at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I came from a very European kind of view of education where everything was very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You never spoke back to the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You wouldn't dare show up without your assignment completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Here I noticed that children just yelled things out in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and even spoke among themselves while the teacher was giving the lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I thought they were going to get killed but I saw the teacher just said "be quiet," and nothing terrible was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">A lot of times they came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they didn't have the homework and I just could not relate to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I thought something just terrible, terrible would happen if I came without my homework or if I spoke out of turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So, I really, really could not understand the American system. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It was very hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I felt very <span class="NPIP">outside</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I never kind of quite got into the fun of the activities at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I always had a certain sadness and memories that just kept haunting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It didn't help that nobody ever asked me anything or wanted to even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Even at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and though I'm quite sure that all the teachers were perfectly aware that I was their one and only Holocaust student, a survivor student. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">No teacher ever befriended me especially or tried to help me especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They just kind of let me be. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But then again, now I'm thinking about it, I was very, very shy and very introverted and maybe they thought it was better to just let me be. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">My mother helped me a great deal with the English. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She worked with me constantly because she was a teacher and she had a great deal of patience. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Hebrew I was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">As great as I had all the material things I could wish for, and I seemingly fit in very well with the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I was in the right crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was among the most popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was in the right clique, but it was never right for me because nobody -- I had a lot of problems <span class="NPIP">inside</span> that I didn't know how to deal with and it seemed nobody else knew either at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Also, I got the feeling that if I ever spoke about prewar things, somehow my parents didn't like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They wanted me to forget and just accept this as a new life, as a new start and just go on from there and forget everything from the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I had a lot of trouble with this because I very often had dreams and flashbacks and I had nobody to tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  What kind of flashbacks came particularly strong or what are the recurring memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  I was terribly afraid of electrical things, a lightening storm, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I mean if my mom said plug in the radio, it was like "do I have to, couldn't Debbie do that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I don't know why, but I got this huge anxiety attack when anything electrical came into play. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I know there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I never wanted to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I always wanted only to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">That seemed better somehow because no matter how hard I tried, everytime I took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> I could not help but remember waiting in <span class="DLF">line</span> and how humiliating 1t was and how cold and how scared I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I was afraid I would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="481"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> rides. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It's a big treat for child. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Let's go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We'll go through the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I had to make believe this was a real thrill but when I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all I could think of was it's a journey into oblivion. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I just wanted to get off, and I couldn't say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I had to say, "oh, I love this. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">This is great.</span><span class="sentence" id="490">"So, 1t was really very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I only liked stale bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">My mother only served fresh stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I would always leave things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I'd save them for later so they would get stale. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Bizarre. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">She didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">She didn't have a clue, and I felt strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I really did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  Did people see your tattoo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well, I was so totally ashamed of my tattoo because I felt that this was a mark of some sort that I had committed some great grievance sin for which I had been adequately punished, but I certainly didn't want anybody to know that I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I mean that was like, my God, I would sooner die than have someone know. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So, my mom was very understanding about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">In the winter I only wore long sleeved things and then in the summer she bought all these pancake powders and started mixing them to match my skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Every morning she'd get this waterproof stuff and she'd mix the color to be exactly right and we'd feather it and powder it and I thought it was really quite good, but in all honesty, anybody who had any eyes would have seen that there was something on my arm that I was covering, but no one ever asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">In fact, it's strange, I remember over hearing a teacher in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Somebody who came to teach after I was already there and somebody must have been saying "See her, she's the little girl that came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> " and this person in total ignorance and I heard this said "It couldn't be. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">No children survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So, blotto me out totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I had no -- they had no psychologists. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">My parents never thought of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I was in desperate need.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first time you felt really at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Was there anything in particular that made you feel, now I can trust the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  I think it was a very gradual -- I know they overwhelmed me with presents in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I got this doll -- in fact I still have her. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">She's probably a treasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It's a honey bunch doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Dick Tracy, whatever, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I was the envy of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I was overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I think the trust came little by little because I saw how my mom always worked with me on my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> things. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Whenever I needed anything for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she would take me, anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">When I saw how they were trying to unite me with Rene, I think that's when I knew that these people really care. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Again, it didn't feel like my real mother and father, but I guess as close as I could come to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  What had happened to Rene in the meantime and how did you get reunited?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Well, Rene was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> when the Red Army came, and he did go on that march whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Somehow there was a Doctor Kilina who liked Rene alot and he took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and Rene became part of his family, kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Sometime thereafter, this Doctor Kilina had to flee because the communists had already taken over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and someone had something about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Anyway, it was necessary for him to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So, he had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rene</span> , and it really broke his heart because Rene talks with great love for this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He knew how to reach a little boy who had been through trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">He knew just what this little boy needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He needed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It broke his heart, but he gave Rene into the care of his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">In the meantime, Rescue Children was trying to locate Rene. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I don't know what enroutes they were or were not making but when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to raise all this money, Life Magazine had done a complete story about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It seemed when Doctor Kilina got to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he happened to pick up that Life Magazine issue, saw my name, Irene Goodman, and it clicked for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">That must be Rene's twin sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And that's really how he called and that's how we found out where Rene was. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Of course that was wonderful because then I started writing to Rene and my parents really did -- it was very hard to get him out from behind the Iron Curtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> for a while, but Rene loved it because he learned how to ski. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">He really was just up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and he had a great time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Then I think he had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for while, but anyway, make a very long arduous <span class="DLF">path</span> with lots of politicians helping, lots of money passing hands and the help of a most unique individual, and I'm going to name him, Mr. Maurice Enwright who saved hundreds of children, all just out of the kindness of his heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">People just paid his expenses and he brought children back. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">He spent a lot of time with Rene and finally came the day when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">That was quite a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  How was it when you two met again? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You hadn't seen each other for --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Since 1945, and this was now 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">When I was told he was coming I was very excited, very excited, but I didn't know how I was going to speak to him because you see I was now speaking English. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I had forgotten my Polish, not totally yet, but practically because I was still in correspondence with my friend Miriam, and he spoke Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He was learning English in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> but -- so I was a little apprehensive and I wasn't quite sure, and with all this build up and everything when we finally saw each other it was like we just stared at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">It's not like we ran towards each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We just looked at each other and I thought, gee I'm much bigger than him. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He seemed kind of small next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I guess that's what happens when a girl is twelve and a boy 1s twelve, because he very quickly out distanced me the following year. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But, there was a feeling that we completed some kind of a journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Something came to completion and I remember thinking that my real parents would be happy to see that we are together. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It wasn't until the next day that we actually started to talk a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was not fireworks or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Did you have somebody now to talk to about your experience or did you not talk to Rene much about it either?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  It would seem that perhaps we would talk about this, but somehow I think the atmosphere in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was again, to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">This 1s a new life, this is <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So, that even Rene and I, I only remember one conversation with him and it didn't have anything to do with the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It had to do with a memory I had of long ago of him getting bitten by a bee when we were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">That led us to talking about some of the toys we had and going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">We only had this conversation once, and in fact, Rene and I were not terribly close. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Again, Rene was more extroverted and more social and not as interested in studies and more into fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So, we were very opposite and again unfortunately I excelled at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and Rene didn't, so my parents were constantly holding me up as an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">A terrible thing to do to any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So, in a sense Rene resented me a little but what happened was the less he did what he should have been doing, the more I felt I had to make up. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So, I had to be not only super smart, but super duper extraordinary smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I had to excel at everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So, Rene was more into social things and I was more into being very studious and quiet, but I'm sure it just came out in different ways for me and Rene, because he certainly had bad memories that he needed to deal with, and for me I sublimated myself in my studies and excelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">By the time I graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I was the salutatorian of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I was the editor of the year book. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I was the captain of the cheerleading squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I was on the basketball team. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">You name it, I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I joined the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I knew how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Was it difficult for you to trust anybody except maybe your parents or to trust the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Yes, I always felt that whatever I had, it could all be gone tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I never felt that it would be ongoing and that I could be lucky enough to really have a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So, I was a very serious young girl and teen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  Did you date at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Being a good American girl in some ways --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  I'll say I started dating later than my girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I was not interested in dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I don't think I knew how to form relationships like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It was very difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I didn't start dating until I was well into <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , probably close to my senior year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  You mentioned earlier that your name in Life Magazine article was Irene Goodman. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">How did the change -- you were born --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  Renatta Goodman. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Well, I think the Polish lady took a few liberties with my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I guess she didn't care for Renatta and name me Iranka, which I guess 1s a Polish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , again, nobody really asked me what my name was or wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> I was known as Iranka, but I knew that I was Renatta but nobody really asked me there either. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I guess here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> my parents just made it American and decided Irene. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They said Irene, I probably nodded my head and was Irene. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">To compound this, now I remember I also had a Hebrew name, Rifca, which I found out from my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">When I was enrolled in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the teacher asked me what my name was I said it was Rifca and he said to me, well, I have two other Rifcas in this class. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">It's going to be too confusing for me to have a third one, so I think we'll call you Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">That's exactly how it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  So you did not have a history that was validated? </span><span class="sentence" id="609">You did not have a name that was validated? </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Who were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I was this Esther Irene, whoever that was and that was somebody who needed to excel for my parents, to make them happy that they had adopted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">That was the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  What did you major in in terms of education? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">What kind of profession did you pursue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  It may seem odd but I had always wanted to be a doctor, even though the thought of going to a doctor is a nightmare, for me, or anything to do with being sick is not acceptable and <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> are totally out of the question for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">But I wanted to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I found when I started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and even in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I was very good at the sciences. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I enjoyed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I liked math, which was a terrible thing because all girls were supposed to be stupid in math at that time, and that didn't gain me much popularity. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I mean I even still liked math when I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> so I minored in it and minored in physics and majored in chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I didn't go on to be a doctor because the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that I was raised in, being a very traditional <span class="BUILDING">orthodox Jewish home</span> and you know "orthodox Jewish girls didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They got married, they had children and they became teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">They became teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I knew I didn't want to be a teacher, so I became a biochemist and I did research, chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I worked for <span class="BUILDING">Cornell Medical College</span> and Albert Einstein.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  Did you teach at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  I did teach also after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I taught biology and chemistry and physics. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I did teach, although I said I'd never teach, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">That was actually a horror for me because now I actually had to demonstrate things to the children and here we went with electrical things. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">But I got smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I asked for volunteers to plug in things and push the switches and do the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I've gotten over that now that I'm passed 50, but it was a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Housework, doing the vacuuming or plugging in anything for years and years would bring on major anxiety attacks, which I didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Now I understand that it was just anxiety attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  When did you begin to talk about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  Actually not until 1985. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">My husband knew that I was a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">My children knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">It was becoming a little bit more okay to be a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">People were finally interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Then Benjamin Meade has started this whole big group and there was the very first Holocaust reunion and I thought I might even go to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I was pretty excited about it but I don't know if I might have mentioned it to somebody casually that I'm a Holocaust survivor and they just kind of looked at me and said, "you're too young, it couldn't be." </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They negated my whole thing and what could you remember and what could you possibly remember you were so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So, I didn't go to the reunion and I felt very -- I didn't feel like I really belonged there either. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It's kind of a strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">My whole life is trying to find where I belong and here I didn't even feel welcome with other Holocaust survivors because they somehow belittled my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Kind of felt I couldn't remember much and how terrible could it have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Needless to say, they were so ignorant because they didn't have a clue as to what the Mengele twins had undergone. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">It wasn't until 1985 when there was actually an organization of twins that came about because of the first Holocaust gathering in '83 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> where Eva Core a twin went, and she started searching for other twins, because she too didn't feel comfortable with the other Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">We didn't have anything in common somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And so, when she called to tell me that she is a twin and we are having a reunion in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in January and I said "there were other twins besides Rene and me who survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="654">For sure I thought that Rene and I were the only ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Absolutely, the only children to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">She started telling me no, there are a hundred and some odd all over the world and this I said, I remember I called Rene in June and said "We have to go to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We have to."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  So, you decided to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  No, Eva was -- everybody was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> first and then on to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to hold this mock trial of Mengele, but Rene and I felt that we just -- going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a little too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We told Eva we'd meet her in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and that's what we in fact did. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I was amazed to see so many twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I was hoping that I would recognize somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I was hoping somebody might recognize me, but it just didn't happen for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Rene was luckier. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He did find twins who remembered him very specifically and in some way that's bizarre, but it kind of validated that he was really there, and yes what you think happened, happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But I wasn't getting any validation for me and I still felt like well, if none of them recognize me, where was I. Was I in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Was I in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> so much, or was I just so extremely quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Eva -- it seemed like a lot of the other twins remembered each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I was only three or four years younger and I don't know if that made the big difference or whether I was just so quiet and kept so to myself that nobody just ever noticed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Because I really truly did not speak to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I spoke to no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So, for me the trip, though I saw the twins and when I heard some of their stories, oh yeah, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It confirmed some things for me but I didn't feel totally validated because I didn't find anybody who really knew me until I met these older twins from <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They were originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> also and they had been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and I don't know if they said it to make me feel good, which is probably what it was, but they thought that vaguely they had remembered me from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They had worked as nurses in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they thought they remembered a little girl with long, blondish hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Well, there probably weren't too many because heads were shaved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , except the twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">My head was never shaved so I always had this long hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Then there was another woman, Ruth Elias, a horrendous story, but she was also from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">She was on the same transport with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and she thought that she remembered me from the Czech lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So, I had to be satisfied with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Was that the experience that made you do more research? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Did you ever try to find out what really happened to your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Never before. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I never read Holocaust books. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I did in late 1970s attend some lectures by Elli Resell, but now I felt I needed to find out more and I did start looking and asking questions and I guess doing major research on what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I learned a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I was able to find out a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I found out that there are very good records at the <span class="BUILDING">Polish Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I was able to get documentation about me and experiments on me and when. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">While we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for this reunion, we also managed to find our transport stubs on what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> we had to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with my mom and Rene and actually found a thing that said that my mom had died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> where they housed all the Czech documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I don't recall the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">We didn't find anything about my father there, but I found out just this passed year actually since having been to the Holocaust Museum, I found out a great deal about my dad and even got a picture from the <span class="BUILDING">Auschwitz Museum</span> of him in his prisoner's garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I can't tell you what that was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Because I have a great many photographs and I could see from when he was healthy and everything was good and to see what he looked like now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was really a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Also, we learned that he was killed as a prisoner and I can only hope that he didn't have too many days there and that he didn't suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But I'm now continually looking, I discovered this great book The Chronicles of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I'm in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">My number, everything, so I'm pretty well documented and so is Rene. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">My dad is in there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I'd like to -- I don't know enough about my mother except for what we found at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> that she died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but I'm like on a search to find out more what happened after we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I don't know if I'll succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  You just mentioned your number again, would you tell us the number?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  It's 70917.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  You also said that you learned more about what was done to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Do you know what was done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Well, again I'm not 100 percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">It does show that I did have some kind of blood work up. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I had some kind of injections. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I don't think I ever got all my documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was just what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I don't really know what was done to me, but it couldn't have been good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  I would like to go to your family, this family now. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">When did you and how did you meet your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  I actually met him on a blind date and that's how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">This is my second marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I don't speak about this too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I was married once before, for a very short time and my oldest girl is from that marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Unfortunately I was married to a wife abuser. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I wouldn't have been able to get out of the marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I probably felt I deserved to be treated this way except something about having a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I said I in my heart knew I could never subject a child to this kind of an atmosphere and that's what really gave me the strength and also a very good friend and neighbor who helped me through this very trying time. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And then of course my parents -- I was ashamed to tell my parents, so we had this charade for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I felt I would be disappointing them somehow that I had failed at my marriage but I finally owned up to it and of course they came and collected me. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They didn't like him anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Again, I married perhaps not for the right reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I still felt very alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Most of my friends were getting married and I wanted to have a family of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I felt I had nothing and this man had had a bad marriage, he had a son, and what could be better? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I could be a mom to this 13 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I was 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">What did I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">It seems nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So, part of me also staying in this marriage was for the son's sake because I tried to smooth things over because he was pretty strict with his son also. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I saw there was nothing I could really do that would change and I needed to get out for my own child and so I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  How long were you married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  I think six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  And then you met --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Then I met Sammy on a blind date. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I don't know if I was in the marriage frame of mind because I was beginning to see that I had a lot of things going on that were not resolved. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I had trouble with relationships and I wasn't trusting and of course I was a little scared of men too. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I didn't have the best image of men after the doctors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> either so, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Sammy was just so sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I married Sammy because he was kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">That was his outstanding quality and it's nothing against him if things had been different, I don't think Sammy would have been the kind of person I would have married, but I married him because I knew he would be good to me and he wouldn't hit me and he was kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  You did not really talk to him about how you felt about your problems either?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  No, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  How did you live with that? </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Were there nightmares?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Yes, nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He used to wake me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">He'd always ask me what's the matter and I'd say "Nothing, just a little nightmare." </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I did not talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Just before I married Sammy we were living with my parents and my daughter Lori and Lori had noticed my number and she was about six or seven at the time and she asked me what that was and I started telling her that I had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I wasn't going into details and my mother overheard me and she says, "You don't need to be telling her this." </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So, again, I just didn't know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I said, "Mom I'm not telling her anything, but you know how can I not explain to her the number on my arm?" </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But, my mother said you don't have to tell her anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So, I think Lori knew after that that I had survived but she never asked me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I never volunteered anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Part of it was my own thing was that I didn't want to lay this heavy burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I wanted my kids to have a childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I wanted them to have everything that I didn't and that's probably why I also remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I wanted Lori to have a father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  When did you ever do something for yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  Good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I don't know, I don't have an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I'm still the person who feels she needs to do for others, even though at this point in my life where I have this MS and I don't get out that much, one of the highlights of my week is visiting sick patients at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and trying to bring cheer to terminal patients who are suffering with cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">The only time -- I guess that's the answer to your answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I do something for myself by helping out people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  Is the MS, do you know whether or not that is in any way connected or might have been connected to things that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  Well, it can be definitely acknowledged because they really don't know that much about MS, but my neurologist said that certainly whatever happened to me predisposed me to an illness so that it wound up being MS. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">But certainly all those injections and the circumstances of my childhood could certainly lay the ground work for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  Did you ever go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> or did you ever visit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  I've never been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but I did visit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as I found out not too long ago that my father has a sister who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I was fortunate in having a wonderful, wonderful girlfriend who said, "Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I'll take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I'll treat you the trip and I'll go with you and we'll do it together." </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">That was -- I think it was in 1987 or 1988 when I made the trip and I met my aunt and her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">My first cousin, and I can't describe in words the moment that we saw eachother. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">This was truly something that they never thought they'd ever see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They knew all about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They knew about Rene. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">My parents had been in touch with them when we were born and sent many, many photographs to my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So, it was a dream kind of come true. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I never thought I'd be able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was still before the <span class="DLF">Wall</span> came down, and we spent four or five days with my aunt and cousin and my aunt told me lots of stories that she remembered and she showed me the many, many photographs and letters that my father had written to her from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">She even gave me the letters, and at the end of the trip she gave me all these precious, precious photographs and it was like getting a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">It was my life and she gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">She gave me a knick knack, a little music box that used to belong to my father and so it's very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It was also very special because I feel that I don't think we'll ever see each other again, but we are in correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">She just sent me beautiful embroidered tablecloths. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It's wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  Did you get a sense whether or not people in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> at that time knew that much about the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">ANSWER:  Interestingly enough, I think they knew hardly anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">My aunt, though she knew of the suffering, after all she did live through the Dresden bombing which killed my grandparents, she did not have any idea of what was happening and what happened to us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">She speaks German and we used an interpreter, a young woman in her late 30s who was absolutely astounded at the things I was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">She had no idea, not a clue, that this is what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">It was very sobering and kind of upsetting to me to see the such a trauma was going unacknowledged. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">People knew very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  Things have changed in that respect in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a little bit in the late '70s and early '80s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  Yes, people did start talking about it and there was some recognition and we had Holocaust Memorial Day and a lot of literature has come out, but there are always those who say what do we need this for and I always say, look at the world today. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">You shouldn't ask why you need to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Look at this world today. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Look where we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">We haven't yet learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">We haven't learned not to hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">QUESTION:  You started speaking publicly or in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Tell me a little bit about the reasons for doing that and what it was like to do that after so many decades of not speaking about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">ANSWER:  It was extremely difficult for me when I came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and there was quite a bit of publicity in magazines and New York Times on which we appeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I had friends who had known me many, many years who are totally astounded, shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">They could not believe that I was a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They said "You're so American." </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I took that as a compliment of sorts, but I also as Rene and I started talking and June started talking and started telling my children and Sam a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I realized that I have an obligation, that I had an obligation to my parents, if not to anybody else, to speak about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I suddenly found myself talking to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , appearing on TV, appearing 1n books and talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I also had the very good fortune to after the trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to make connection with a Doctor Kestenberg who saw me professionally and also as a friend and encouraged me to write poetry or talk about it and that has helped me greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I don't often talk, maybe two or three times a year because that saying it gets easier as you keep doing it, it isn't at all true with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Somehow, it's harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Every time I give a talk or give an interview I get pushed back into that time and it takes me weeks to get out of the depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I don't know why, whether it's because I'm older and I'm beginning to see that I'm at the end of my life rather than at the beginning or whether I feel so hopeless about the world because of the way it's going, feeling that all that's happened that somehow there was such an evil unleashed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that it's lingering to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We haven't learned or been able to rise above it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It was something not of this world happened there and it continues. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">It continues, where I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It's hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  Do you still think that you are being hurt now, differently, understood differently than all your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  I know my mom even though she's gone now but when I first started speaking she never came to anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">She never watched any of the TV shows. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">She could never look at the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">In a way I wanted her to. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I wanted her to be a little proud of me, not that I'd rather have done something else greater, but this 1s what I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I'm trying to make -- to do something for humanity with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">If I can just touch one person to kind of give over the message that we're all people and we all have feelings and we shouldn't hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">You don't have to agree with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We don't have to be the same religion but we can respect each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">We don't even have to like each other if that's too difficult, but there's a sanctity to human life which we've totally lost sight of and my friends understand me better today, but even today I'm still very much that little girl who's scared of authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Policemen terrify me. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I'm still very much that little Holocaust kid who's there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  Are you still trying to deal with everything yourself then, or have you ever seen a therapist or have you asked your family to help you in a different way? </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Have you ever reached out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">As I said, Doctor Kestenberg has seen me professionally as a therapist and that's been helpful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I think speaking with my brother -- we've gotten very, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">We're almost inseparable. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">It's too bad we live such a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">My children, it's still hard to talk to them but I think they're very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">They always want to look at the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">They always want to know what's the latest thing and what did I find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">They come to my lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They come to the TV things even though they don't want to be part of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">But it's hard for their kids too, because even though in my attempt all my life to protect them from this, I guess I was a little bizarre. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I mean, I was a strange mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Let's go back to the stale bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">They laughed me out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time with that, but my values seem to be somewhat different. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">So, I think they saw some crying and things that they didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">At a joyous thing you'd find me crying because I'm saying "My mom and dad aren't here." </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And what would life have been like, and I wish my parents could know my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Would they finally be proud of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">It's hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I think my kids have somehow subliminarily absorbed some of my hurt even though I tried desperately to protect them and not be an overprotective mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I deliberately leaned back the other way. "</span><span class="sentence" id="861">Yeah, you can cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> , okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I'm joking about that, but I really tried to be- I was always reading these child rearing books from Doctor Spock to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I wanted to be sure that I was not making them nuts with my worries and fears. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  Can you describe for me a little bit this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">What feelings do you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="866">What makes it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  Well, I never thought about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Well, my children would make it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me, but my older daughter is now married and my younger one about to get married 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So, I miss them a great deal but I have photos everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I think what makes this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me is the fact that I have finally gotten my hands on some memorabilia from my early childhood and I have a vast collection of pictures of myself with Rene and my parents and just looking at them I can piece together the kind of life we must have had and the kind of life my parents tried to provide for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">It looks like we were very happy children, so I think my parents did a really good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">In some ways, maybe their love and their strength helped both of us survive somehow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  You do have MS now. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">What is it like for you to live with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  In a word it's a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">The worst thing about having MS is that I've actually had to go to a doctor and I actually have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I actually need therapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I have to keep dealing with these medical people which for me is a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">It's my own trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I never wanted to go to doctors, and don't like them much. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I try to stay out of <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But I've had to come to terms with the fact that this illness I do need the therapy and I do need a doctor's supervision of medication and I can really say is that somehow I've been blessed I don't know whether by my parents who are gone, but I've been blessed with a neurologist who is so sensitive to my needs and understands my hang up with doctors and is so gentle and just kind of try to point me in the right direction and never pushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">He is actually not just my doctor anymore, he's just become one of my very best friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So, that's turned out okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But I still, when he says "Go to the <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> for blood work." </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I say "Do I have to? </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I really don't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Can we do it next month?" </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And he says, "Okay, we'll wait."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  Is there any distinction by the way between your feelings about female or male doctors because it seems that male doctors --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  Actually my neurologist is a male doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I've always tried to find myself a female doctor very unsuccessfully, so that's where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">The other thing I hate about MS besides the medical side of it, is that I'm no different than any other MS person. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">It's robbed me of my independence and my need to excel and be independent and do for others and this really curtails that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I find that I need to depend on people, which is very hard for me because I've never found that I really could depend on people and I do have now some wonderful friends that I can depend on but I'm still 1n the end and I try not to ask too much from anybody because I fell I'll overstep my requests and it will be hard to do things for me all the time so very often I just suffer 1t out myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I still feel alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  So this particular illness has in a way is doing the same thing to you that your experience in the Holocaust has done for you, has it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  Yes, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And it's also society and the way they react to someone who's not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">That doesn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Although I try to educate them and joke a lot with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I keep telling people that just because I'm in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheel chair</span> doesn't mean that I don't have a brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">You don't have to talk slowly to me and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Just kind of, when you think about it, it's sad that this has to be said in the year 1995. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">You'd think we'd be more educated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">QUESTION:  We have talked about the impact of the Holocaust on your life and also this interview, but if I were to ask you to think and describe in one capsule, how do you feel that experience has really shaped your life, what would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">ANSWER:  That's really a hard question. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I can only really say that no matter how hard I try, everything in my life always leads back to the Holocaust and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">It's just always, always there beneath everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Perhaps, it has made me in a strange kind of way I think I'm strong because of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">People always tell me, "Oh, you're so strong." </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I don't know if I'm strong but I feel I have an endurance that's beyond the average. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I can tolerate more things. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I have more patience. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I appreciate things more because I always know how elusive they can be and how very quickly things could change. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  For so many years your memories were denied, now that you're working on that much more in a positive way and also trying to work through it in therapy and so on, do you feel that some memories are safer to be buried to be gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I've talked about a lot things and I talk with my therapist about a great many memories and things, but there is -- I find there is some kind of a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">There are certain things I don't want to even try to put to words because I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I can't and I don't want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  Have you seen those movies that came out -- there was a great debate in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> too, anyway, do you think that experience can be expressed adequately in popular films or how do you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">ANSWER:  I think it's a two sided thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">It's important to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">A lot of people will not read the books and not attend the lectures and a lot of people need to have things -- movies that are popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I think it's always watered down, and somehow it takes away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I'm not even expressing it properly but it was so horrible and so awesome and so out of this world that you can dilute it and make it into a popular film, it just loses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  Is there anything that you would like to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  I have a lot to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">QUESTION:  There are some memorabilia from your life here on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> and it would be nice if maybe you could say something about them maybe one after another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">ANSWER:  This is Life Magazine from November 1947 and it is an article about me and another little boy who came from Europe to help raise funds for the European war orphans and we're pictured sitting on a step of some sort and behind us are all these clothes that have been bought for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">More clothes than we've ever seen in our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I'm sitting -- I have long curls. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I always say that's probably why they chose me to be this so-called poster child. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I notice that I'm wearing a plaid dress which was one of the best dresses in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and that is the only dress I came with. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">In the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> we wore the same clothing every single day and then for the sabbath we would get a new pretty little dress and then back into our old -- it would get washed and we'd get it back again on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">We didn't have designer jeans or I have to have a blue sweater today or a red sweater tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">We had what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I see about five outfits for me with a coat and a hat and Charlie also. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We each had a -- I'm holding on to a pink teddy bear and Charlie is holding on to a very nice gray elephant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  And that is the article that Doctor Kilina saw and recognized you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">He recognized the name Irene Goodman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Now which one has the letters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  The letter 1s in that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">On occasion packages would come to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with clothing and shoes and always Mr. Tenzer would bring us Barton's candy and gum which we kids just could not get enough of. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">One day a shipment came and there was this beautiful red sandals and I had been wearing brown shoes and this plain dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">We wore the same clothing every single day except for Shobot and I really wanted those red shoes desperately. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So, when we got to trying them on the shoes were really tight on me but I said "They feel great. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">They're perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I love them." </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">The next day we were on an outing near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we went on this long walk and I'm walking in my red sandals and before very long I can barely walk because I've got blisters and sores and my feet are bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">The shoes don't fit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">The shoes don't fit and the counselor who was with us noticed and looked at my feet and said "Why did you say that they fit?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="956">I wanted red shoes and they were the only red shoes." </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I hated my brown shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">The out shot of the story was they took the red shoes away from me, but they had to buy me shoes and I got the white, white sandals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">QUESTION:  So there was a little bit of vanity there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  Here's the letter you sent Rene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  Actually, these are two letters that I wrote to Rene after we found him. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I could read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">They're kind of funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">This is written March 5, 1950. "</span><span class="sentence" id="966">Dear Rene. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I thought you had lots of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I had lots of fun in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">We saw a play about Esther and (in Hebrew.) </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Today, I'm going ice skating with my friend." </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I've drawn a picture of an ice skate. "</span><span class="sentence" id="972">Love and kisses, Irene."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  What's the date on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  March 5, 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Now, another letter, but it's not dated. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">It's probably around the same time. "</span><span class="sentence" id="977">Dear Rene, I received your letter and I'm glad that you are well and enjoyed your trip to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I live near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and soon we will go bathing every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">My <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> keep me very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I'm learning how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Dear Rene, I hope you will be together soon with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Lot's of love and kisses from all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Your loving sister, Irene." </span><span class="sentence" id="984">The English is not so great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  This is another --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  This is a little hand-operated music box with an angel at the top on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> with birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">It belongs to my father and my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> gave it to me when I visited her, and it plays this song in German. "</span><span class="sentence" id="988">All the Birds are Here Again." </span><span class="sentence" id="989">That little angel on top has a mandolin and it turns around as the music is playing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">QUESTION:  I forgot to ask you one question. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Do you have any hobbies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="992">ANSWER:  Yes, I love calligraphy. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">It's just the love of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I discovered -- well, I've always loved letters but I wasn't aware of the so-called "art of calligraphy" until about 1978. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But, if I look at some of my notebooks from years back I can see even <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> I was making these fancy letters and always printing neatly, taking great pride in my writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Then, I discovered calligraphy. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I used to do it -- I thought I was getting fairly good at it and then this MS came along and kind of cut my career, but I love it so much that I continue doing it with my shaky hand by using weights. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I use a mouse stick as well and I look like a person from <span class="NPIP">outer space</span> when I do it but it really brings me a great deal of joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">I love making pictures out of words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I do it especially for friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I love making cards and I make my neurologist a calendar every year on his birthday and he's got an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> full of my work hanging on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">You don't see the work now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">It's all behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> because we've recently papered here, so everything came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I think if not for my calligraphy I would lose my sanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">QUESTION:  You have also done poetry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And I also -- a well kept secret, I do poetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I started it because Doctor Kestenberg has suggested to me that I write. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">When I brought her the first poem she said you should really do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">You really have a knack and every time I've done something she has made sure it has gotten into a journal, into a book, into a something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">I don't feel I have the talent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I think they're just poems, but she likes them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  Would you be willing to share one or two?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  I could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">QUESTION:  So, these are one or two poems that you have written?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  Yes, and most of my poems are really a reflection of how I felt as a child because that's how I understood things around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">This particular poem was written -- it was about Rene, my mother and I are going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and we're on this march to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that's going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="1018">The long column painfully marches on a journey to the end surrounded by the darkness black with terror yet untold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Silence shattered by rifle fire, dogs ferociously bark, bodies falling to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> eventually lie still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">The snow so white upon the <span class="DLF">field</span> is muddy slush beneath my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Icy chill invades my bones, fingers aflame with searing pain, weariness engulfs me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Mother quickly prods me on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I hold back my tears and silently march on." </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">This is one that I wrote about a memory I have about hiding among dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I was six and half years old at the time. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Some nights transport me back to a time where absolute fear was mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Like a stone between dead bodies I lie holding my breath afraid I'll die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> a cold wet gritty slime, stiff limbs with mine intertwine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">A shiver or twitch will reveal that I am one who still can feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I wait with a pounding heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Will the bullets split it apart? </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I shut my eyes so they won't see the sadness, fear inside of me."</span></p>
