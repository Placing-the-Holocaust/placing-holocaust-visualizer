<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Had you seen combat in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Yes, I saw combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I got into — I was in the Normandy landings on the day after D-Day — I — after D-Day on — on June seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was up on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and my duties then were, again, I — I had a — an interrogation team and we were interrogating prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But under the — at that point, of course, it was combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It was combat and interrogating and shooting some more and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Everybody was in combat then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  On your way through Europe, did you — did you encounter any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that had just been liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Through Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Yes, the only one that I encountered on the way through the — in the campaign was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Nordhausen</span> , which we came upon not knowing where we — that there was a concentration until we — til we ran into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was a — 1t was a horrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Knowing that my parents must be in one of those, I — I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could see my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It wa — it was a — an impression that stayed with me for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It was the — bodies lying around, people wandering around in a daze. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We tried June 8, 1999 to, the little time that we had, we were moving pretty fast at the time, chasing the rest of the Germans in the direction of the — of the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we were there for about a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">They — some of them, as I recall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of — of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> many of them by the way in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They wanted those guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And if I lost any of them on the way, I — I-I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But they — the guards were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we had ways of, you know, interrogate — ways of interrogate — this — this was not a friendly interrogation, so we made them talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Not by physical force in any way, but by — oh, various things. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Like we have him take off his clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And when a man stands there in front of you without his clothes on, he’ll start talking pretty soon, we found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That’s an interesting thing we learned over — over the — we sort of picked up as we went through the war and — interrogation techniques that they didn’t teach us in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But he f — he talked and I got — I got his story, of course, I can’t remember the details now. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But I did get a — the story of some of the atrocities that the — they were — they committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I turned the people over — the — the guards over to the military police that picked them up and took them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">June 8, 1999
QUESTION:  The guards that you said you — if you misplaced them along the way, you — you don’t remember, do you know what happened to those guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  No, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  You also said that you employed techniques that you didn’t learn in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Can you tell me a little bit about your training in — in some of the techniques that you were trained to use and some of the ones you learned along the way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yes, well, in the military I was — I was — I went to —I was originally in field artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I went to <span class="BUILDING">officer candidate school</span> and became — I was an artillery officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then I was, shortly after graduation at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Sill</span> , <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">artillery school</span> was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was called one night — one evening I was called in and was told that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to — wanted me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">intelligence school</span> , which was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ritchie</span> , right in — 1n <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> here, then called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">That was the <span class="BUILDING">military intelligence school</span> and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Oh, we learned all kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Don’t know anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign maps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to — to know what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">These were June 8, 1999 Maryland — Maryland maps, maps of the — of the <span class="REGION">Ritchie area</span> , but printed in various languages including Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I remember one night that they dropped me off someplace at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and gave me this — this map. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And from landmarks and all that, you identified where you were and which way you were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Well, that was important but in — basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in German, of course, my native language, I also knew French. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And that’s the direction we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if — if necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We were trained in order of battle, identifying — we learned everything about the German — we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their — their insignia. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That was all part of — of the training and the units, the organization of the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba — how strong they were, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That was all part of it because that was all part of — of the interrogation process. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And so when we — when I got into — to the combat are — zone, interrogating the people was simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">One thing, for example, was that every German had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Now that soldbuch — soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And it was easy to figure out who he was and what he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So the first thing we’d ask them is, give me your soldbuch. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that was — now you knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338" June 8, 1999 Fisilier-Batallion(ph), yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And he’d say yeah, and take it from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Most of the interrogations were actually not difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Most of them talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now you ran into some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that’s all they would give you. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But again, you — we — all of us, I think, found ways to — to break them. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend or enemy, respected rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So you made sure that the insignia you were — you were wearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank higher than the man we had, and we could read that. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So we — we played that game, it was — if you had time for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Now a lot of — most of it was right up in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , so you didn’t have time to — to play games. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And at those times we would just play tough, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would — we — we’d say — we’d tell them, okay, we’ll let you walk back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , right through the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Of course they wouldn’t do that cause they’d get shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And things like that, and they would — I don’t really recall anyone I could not break in an — in an interrogation, and I’ve interrogated thousands of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Now, what we did with the information, and we — we — in my case, being in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , I would — my targets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located, what kind of weapons do they have, where’s their artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I would immediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they June 8, 1999 could fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information — the — the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was relevant to who — who was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , what was their morale, how — how strong were they, what kind of weapons did they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And that went — well, we had a lot of good results. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">One of the things that I and my team always did was when we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through the <span class="REGION">area</span> we checked those targets to make su — to see if they had been hit like we — and I think most of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So, it was — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> it was — is rough, cause we were going from <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span> to <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span> , you know, one <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span> at a time, and you know, a hundred — a hundred yards a day, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But after that, of course, on the run, that was a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Once we broke through, it was — it was a different story, it was easier then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  You mentioned in your interview for the Shoah Foundation that British intelligence was superior to American intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Can you clarify that point for me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes, I—I went to —I was shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in December of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> until — until D-Day, so that was six months from — in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And at the time I was sent to — from where we were out in the near — in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> somewhere, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to study with — with British intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They June 8, 1999 had some <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and they — they took us into — and gave us some — some information. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The British had a lot more experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We had absolutely no experience, we were new. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We were — all of — not — I’m not just talking about the — the <span class="DLF">front line</span> type intelligence, but the OSS didn’t exist until just about that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained for years and years as intelligence officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We all learned fr — by — by doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The — I had some contact with OSS people afte — on — well, on — actually still in Europe, but on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the same time, and I listened to some of their stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They were dropped — one particular I remember, who was an artist, or at least that is what he — he faked. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was of Italian descent, a New Yorker who spoke Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He was dropped into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and he sat around painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was — to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was friendly right, to — <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was a friendly <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And that’s the way he collected intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first got in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He got in by parachute, got — the French helped him — French underground helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then he — he sat aro — he tha — he started painting and reporting and they had equipment to — to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And he was around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Course na — he brought nothing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He all gave that to — to his French comrades there. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But again, no June 8, 1999 experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Everything was — whatever we did was done for the first time, on the <span class="REGION">U.S. side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in- intelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the — with the <span class="REGION">colonies</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So — a-and in World War II, of course, they’d been in the war for three years before we came in, or almost three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That was wa-why I said that their — their intelligence was better, they were better organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We were just learning, but we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We — just like everything else, I think, in the — 1n the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Nobody — there were no real soldiers at th — in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">By 1944 we did the — the biggest — biggest job ever done in any — any invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And it was successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I guess as Americans, we’re — we’re quick learners. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We picked up an awful lot from the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They were very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They taught us then. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that I went to in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during that period were very informative, because we talked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us how — how they did whatever we were doing later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">That’s — that’s about — that’s about it for — on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you learned some things on your own and you were successful in — in your interrogations. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And you mentioned one thing that they didn’t teach you was to have your prisoner — June 8, 1999
ANSWER:  Strip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  — get undressed, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">What other kind of things did you improvise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Well, there are — there were — for example, the — the — what they didn’t teach us, they taught us that e-every soldier has a soldbuch, but didn’t tell us what to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That is we picked up ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I — I picked up the first one I looked at and I said, there it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I asked the man ha — you were up with — I told him, I didn’t ask him, I told him, you were up from this and this regiment, or this — and they said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And before that you were something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">One of the things that we did was when — when time allowed, was engage in some small talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Small talk about, well, you got your family back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that would open up suddenly, and then you lead into other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I had some interesting interrogations. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I had — and this is — this is one in a— in a—1na billion, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Had a prisoner, this — we were about — we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he had very little information, but he was willing to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He said tha — actually, he deserted he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I’m not sure that that was right, but it didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But I noticed in papers that he had on him that he was a medical student at the University of Vienna. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so I asked him a — whether he was — took anatomy from Professor Bernkopf(ph) Versowzer(ph) and his mouth opened and he se — di-di-ta-ba — how — but how did you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I said, I’m an intelligence officer, I know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And he just couldn’t understand why, June 8, 1999 and then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened to his family and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in a place that was known to me, that was the <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , there was one big one. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And she had been killed, and he told me that they were killing these — well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">They didn’t need them, so they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And you know, he was mad and so he said he deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, took him a long time to <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But th — it-1t’s that kind of thing that — that those are interesting little things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">There were many of them, of the different nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was holding one of the — you know, the corners of — of the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We were not penetrated, but we — we — we went in there to hold it, and that was in the famous Battle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hiirtgen Forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there with his troops, holding out. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we could — it’s a dense <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we just couldn't get him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And one day one of — a couple of Germans came out with a white flag and said that they’re currently — name I — I can’t remember the name, but it was a rather, later on, well known in — in — in the history of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">What was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Well, can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring — yeah, he was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He was very sick and he wanted to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And so who was sent in to bring him out, of course?

<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  When did you realize the full extent of the genocide? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">June 8, 1999
ANSWER:  Not really until the end of the war, until about V-E day. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">When we — when I talked to some people in — well, some Germans at that point, we were at the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> — no, that was afterward. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We were still on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And we had some communication with the Russians, who had come across many of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And they were telling us what they had found. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Millions of people killed and although we had interpreters, Russian interpreters, we had a meeting ta — even before V-E day, it — it was in late April, we were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe</span> and we stopped, and the Germans stopped on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , that was agreed that we would — that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe</span> was the — the — the <span class="DLF">border</span> between the two <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And we had arranged and I was invol — I was included in that with our general — meetings with the Russian general. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We got together and we spent a couple of days of just talking through interpreters. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And that 1s the first time that I really found out what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And of course, my parents were on my mind, and not only my parents, the rest of my family, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">That’s when the search began. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Of course, after V-E day, I could not —I wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Figured that — I knew — I had known that my parents had been deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , because in — it was two weeks after I went into the army in — in October °41, I got a postcard that is — it came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and to my — the second cousin who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , or — was my — my address that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And he brought it to me and saying that a postcard had come saying that my June 8, 1999 parents were being deported in October of ’41, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmannstadt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That’s the last information I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">After that, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And so I wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but the army wouldn’t let me. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">As an intelligence officer, the Russians were in — had — had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at the time and that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and they wouldn’t let us go into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So at that point I decided Pll go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And by October — the war was over in March — 1n — 1n — excuse me, in May, May the ninth, excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we were — my team was pulled out in — in July and sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> where our headquarter — <span class="BUILDING">military intelligence headquarters</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">First to — to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And we stayed there for shipment <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There were lots of things at that point, we could have signed up as a civilian to civil government and all the things that were going on, but I decided my best bet was to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and start looking from — from that angle, and if necessary I’d come back as a civilian and of course, I intended to get out of the army, which I did in 1945, and I was separated in — in the 14" of December, 1945, and signed on as a reserve officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I stayed on in the reserves.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Yes, there were a number of things that I was just thinking about in — in the end of 1945 and early ’46. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">As a matter of fact, I was thinking about going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> when I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I was signed up for a transport, one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">youth transports</span> in — back in 1938, immediately after the anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But when the opportunity came to get away to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , I couldn’t wait, that — that was a long s— a long, drawn out process. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They weren’t going anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We met periodically, all the — well, some of us, but nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">As a matter of fact, my — one of my cousins, about four years younger than I, who stayed on then, didn’t get out until about a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It took that long before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> went, June 8, 1999 that’s just about 1939, in the fall of 1939 they finally got them out, then through <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and then on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and in-into a — well, the — the Exodus story. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But — into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I couldn’t wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was — I was too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I was 18 and I was in immediate danger so I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Yes, I wanted to go and I — and grew up in a Zionist idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">A-After the war I was — yes, I wanted to go, I — I thought of going. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I also thought of going back to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , and I was accepted in 1940 — 19 fift — °46, it — in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , in — both in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel(ph</span> ).</span></p>

QUESTION:  — for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Charles Stein. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This is tape number one, side B. And I had asked you about if you had considered going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and you were telling me that you did have some Zionist thoughts and you were considering going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and also you were considering <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">In early ’46, I was considering both of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And in — I was accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I had written to and sent my — my papers to — o-of my previous studies to Basel(ph) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> and I was accepted in both of them, provisionally, if <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> was available in later years. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was accepted for the first year, but for one year only June 8, 1999 and depending on <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> available, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And at the same time, I had — this was now early 1946, and I had talked to a lot — lot of people, you know, after returning and I found out how all these people made all this money, in all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And I said maybe I ought to do — make a little money, I had none. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I had whatever I had saved from my army pay, which wasn’t very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I wasn’t working, I had not found a way to — to do anything and so I said why, why don’t I do something else first? </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So I— I dropped <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and I dropped medicine and I went into the <span class="BUILDING">export business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Opened my own busin — I took — well, first of all I had to learn something about the export, and that was the big thing then that I — I found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I had to learn something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Fortunately 1-in the newspapers I found a two week course that would teach me all about it, and that’s exactly what I did, I— I went — I mean, this is strictly an amateur performance at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I went and took a two week course and I knew all about it, I knew how to — what kind of documents you needed, and how — and all I needed now 1s to find out what I was going to sell and where. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Well, I and a fr — a— a wartime buddy of mine, friend, we’d been through the war together, and I, decided we’d go into the export business, and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And we si — decided that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electrical appliances</span> were a good thing, we — I guess we liked <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electrical appliances</span> , so we went into that and we decided that we would do <span class="REGION">South America</span> — <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> as — as our target. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">That, we had read was good June 8, 1999 <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do, and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Went into business, we — we got in contact with some manufacturers of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">appliances</span> , and we went to various <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> and asked for their importer — lists of importers, which was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And we started writing let — by that time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish — I don’t know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what else to do with it until I went to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , which would have been — so I took Spanish and I was fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">By that time we — we got to the point where I n — I needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so I wrote up a catalog in Spanish, we put that up and a — a letter to all the customers and began working. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Pretty soon we were making a little money, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Not enough to live on, but there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And it lasted for — until early 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">In early 1948 there was a sudden stop of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The dollar was no longer available for payment to <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> , there was a shortage of d — of dollars, there was — there were — there were exchange restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And so the big com-companies could give, you know, six months credit to — to compan — the little companies, like ours, we couldn’t give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They sent a letter of credit in dollars to our <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and as soon as the ship — we could turn over the shipping documents, that the merchandise had been shipped, the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> would release the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar June 8, 1999 letters of credit and so we went out of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And then started an interesting period. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I didn’t know which way to turn, I — I’d never even looked for a job, I didn’t know how to look for — well, I— I knew how, but th-th-th — I didn’t know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I — so I went around and went to an <span class="BUILDING">employment office</span> , one of those <span class="BUILDING">employment agencies</span> and they said yeah, as a matter of fa — it was on <span class="DLF">46" Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And they said yeah, we have a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">There’s — there’s a job opened right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> here at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Nancy Studios</span> , hat makers. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Feather hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">You know, pasted feather on — on the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And — I mean, I — I found that out when I went to — to <span class="BUILDING">Nancy’s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And so I went ik — went over there and they needed someone to run their <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Apparently whoever had the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had quit — was running the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So I went up there and there’re two ladies running the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and I said, here I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They said oh yes, you’ll do. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We — you know, told them who I was and what I had done, I had my own business and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And they — they — they thought that was — that was good, so my major job was making up the payroll and invoices and making sure that money got to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But the environment wasn’t for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">This was a — a— the two ladies was Nancy and her sister were the designers of these hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Their clientele was — were all name designers. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Hattie Carnegie, Lily Daché, a-all kind — you know, th-the — well known names in the fashion business, and they would June 8, 1999 design special things for them, and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Had about 20 or 30 women doing the work, so it was not a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But I started dealing with the clients and that’s — it was something I couldn’t take. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I-It was a strange — you know, being called darling by these floating characters who were dressed in diff — 1-1t was not — not my —my cup of tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But I worked, I — I had to make a living and I was looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And — and I worked there during the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day in September, it was September of ’48, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein, we want you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We have a special project here which 1s right in <span class="DLF">line</span> with your experience during the war and please call this number. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So I called the number in — in the — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and talked to a major and he said — he told me what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the chief of military history, translating the experiences of the German general staff that apparently the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had under contract of some sorts, in and out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that were writing their heart out about their experiences on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I said that sounds interesting, yes, I’m available. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novem</span> — early November, starting in nove — as a matter of fact, the third of November, I — I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Harry Truman and I came at th — came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">That was the day Harry Truman was elected. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , back in uniform, and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> , became chief of the June 8, 1999 translation section of milt — o-office of chief of military history and I spent the next three years there translating and — and writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And by that time, of course, in 1950, summer of 1950 the Korean war broke out, and — ’50 or ’51 — yeah, *50. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Well, I still had some — a year to go and — on my — my three yea — it was a three year appointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And when the time was up, my time was up, I was told that nobody gets out, there’s a war on. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And I was told that I was — but I was told I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to the German side of our project. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And two weeks later I got my orders saying report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> for shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And there I was, not exactly going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Well, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , and went, checked in, was received by the officer in charge of — of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> and — who said, do you speak — is it— you came here as a prisoner of war interrogator, which was one of my specialties. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Oh, let me back up for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">While I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , when I got my orders and I read this thing, that I — I was going over with the MOS, the specialty as a — as a prisoner of war interrogator, I went down to what we called Korean man — what was called Korean management, we called it Korean manglement, and was talking to some old colonel who’d been there since world — since the Civil War, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Looked like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And I said look, I have — you’re sending me to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> with a 93-16. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don’t speak any of those languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And he said, well, we didn’t asked for no languages, they just said they wanted 93-16s. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">June 8, 1999 And I said, yes, sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I knew there was nothing — yeah — well, I talked to this major and he said, do you speak Korean? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I said nope. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He said, Japanese? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The Koreans in the — in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them spoke — still spoke some Japanese, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I said nope. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He said, Chinese? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I said, nope. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">He says, you’re another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I said, you mean you have more? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They’ve been sending us 93-16s and we have — none of them speak Korean. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Okay, they said, but never mind, we’ll — we’ll have an assignment for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And I was assigned to eighth — eighth army headquarters and research and — and — yeah, and research, intelligence research. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And later on, couple of months later I was reassigned as chief of the order of battle, a division of — of eighth army headquarters. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But the experience there was again, this now is December, end of December 1951. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Cold, ice cold, bad weather and all that, and the chief of intelligence, Colonel Bump(ph) when I reported in, I and two other reported in at the same time, said well, ve got an assignment for you, I want you to go up to the second infantry division up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> and observe the air support for our infantry, and Ill call you back when the time comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So we sat up there for about three weeks in the <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> , on top of these ridges, watching air support, getting shot at. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We didn’t do any shooting then, infantry did. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Watching the patrols go out and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Anyhow, we got back three weeks later and came in and I was this — the June 8, 1999 senior of the three of us and so I— I reported. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We came in and we saluted and said, Colonel, we have a report for you on the — on the air support. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We had put our notes together and whipped up a report. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He said, oh, I don’t want your report, I know all about what’s going on up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I just sent you up there because nobody works for me who doesn’t get his feet wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">You know what the war is like, now you can start working on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Was a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Not for — for — not while we were up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Okay, so we — | — then I —I started working and th — stayed there for — until January of 1953, by which time I have had enough of the war and of the army and well, there — there happened to be a — a — there happened to be something that no — none of us knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">In the fall of 1952, all the reserve officers got a letter saying that your — th- the — you were extended, your — your fi — your army still had a five year dur — as — of reserve officers, five years at a time, you had to renew every five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">The other services had already changed to permanent. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And so we did th — by executive order, ba — ba — the president, and when the Korean war broke out all reserve officers were frozen, they had to stay in the — a-all commissions were extended. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But the law expired on the first of April 1953. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So all of us who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> in 1952 had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and out of the army by — by the first of April, and the army decided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance — to give us time to get back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and get processed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And so we got this June 8, 1999 letter saying we’d like you to sign up for the permanent and you’ll go on and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And statistics later on came out that said 66 percent of all the reserve officers said thank you but no thank you, including myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And then in December of 1952, I happened to be — I still had an R and R leave, five days in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , I flew over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , and I ran into some old friends of mine and one of them said, wa — when you — where you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I said well, I’m going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">By the end of January I should be on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And he said, what are you going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And I said I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, I have no — no — no connections anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So I'll just go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I'll — Il find something. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Well, in the — he said, the — oh, this — this friend said, well hey, ve got a job for you, a civilian job here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I’m heading up a new <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in — on the first of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">There’s a new command being formed, the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and far e — and Far East command, a combined command and I’m head of the intelligence policy division and I have one civilian slot, a senior civilian and you’re — you’re it, 1f you want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So I went down to personnel and they explained what it was, and they explained to me what it — what it pays and it paid more than a captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And all the perks with it and I said yeah, why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And I signed up right there and they say yeah, you’re — you’re qu — I told them — I had to write up what I was doing and for — fill out a form. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And they said yeah, you qualify. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And so there I was, and I stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> as a civilian June 8, 1999 intelligence officer until 1955, when I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">That was also the time a little later that same year, °53, when I met this air force lieutenant, female, who showed up there and about a year and a half later we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And Barbara Kinney(ph) became Barbara Stein. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We were married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  I have several questions, but first let me start with your getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">What did you tell your wife about yourself and about your past when you met her and you courted her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Well, first thing I told her was that where — where I had come from, and I told her that I lost my family and I still didn’t know where they were or what happened to them, which is something previously that I had tried all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I tried the Red Cross and the HIAS and the jayce — the JDC, the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> who in 1946 did send me a — a little form letter saying your parents were deported through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmannstadt</span> and did not appear on any survivor lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">That’s all I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But where and what, I — I didn’t find until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Well, anyhow, I — I told her just the basic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I— I wa—I-—I couldn’t go into details. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Those were the things that I talked about, oh, later on, bits and pieces, not — not the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I — I don’t know what it was, but I just couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Of course, there was still, and I think now thinking back of tha — to that period, and I’ve done this for some time now, there was always that, why did they have to die and I — I survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And that was — June 8, 1999 that was certainly in — in — in my subconscious mind, sometimes very much on my conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And it — th — it was — it was just difficult and unless I was asked, I didn’t tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It was that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There were many people that I worked with that didn’t even know, that they thought oh, this guy’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Fortunately I had no particular accent, and so they knew I’d come — I'd started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and I was a New Yorker, that — that was — that was all they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And over the years bits and pieces — I told a little story here, when — when something happened that had a connection with some, but not until — well, the 80’s, when I finally sat down and wrote my whole story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  I'd like to pause for just a second and ask about some of the events that were going around in the years before the 50’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you about first the Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Ho-How closely did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Oh, I followed them very closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">That was something that I — of course, there were newspapers, the magazines. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had a couple of friends who were involved in that, one was at the Nuremberg trials and we corresponded, and he would write to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Another one, a lawyer in the <span class="BUILDING">Washington office</span> of the — the judge advocates office in the army, who was involved in the — in the trials o-o-on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , getting June 8, 1999 the reports in and all that in the — we talked about it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I — I was looking for — for the death penalty for anybody who just walked through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Not all of them got it, but then again, the — the trials went on for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">When I was at military history in 1948, we had a British contingent, three British officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Two of them people like myself, Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">As a matter of fact, the — no, one was German, one was Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And one that their chief was a British colonel, but they were all British army, and they were working with us, because they were going through the same documents and the same background. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We — we also searched documents that — captured documents that we had here — in connection with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And we were looking at the same documents and they were working on background for the trials that were still going on, and so we had close contact and we followed that all — followed that all the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">There were not enough that were punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Did you follow the U.N. debate on the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Every word of it, absolutely, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">As a matter of fact, I was — I was watching the —I was listening to the — that — the final votes, I was counting votes at the time, on radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">No, no, I guess not, didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I — I was — I was listening and on the radio and I was — kept keeping a — a pad. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And when the final vote was tallied — again, this of course now is 1950 — 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I was June 8, 1999 thinking of still again going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But there were many things that — that held me back, you know, personal things that were happening and I — it was always, you know, next week, Ill think about it next week or I'll — Pll look into it next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">By that time I had taken up — I had contact with my cousin ha — at — and meanwhile his mother and father, who had gotten away out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , his father was — came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , they released him. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Mother had gotten a permit to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and so they went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I had seen them in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> so a — a— we had correspondence then, and I thought that I might join them, but I didn’t until many years later when I did go over and I’ve been there quite a few times now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  You didn’t reflect one way or the other on your personal feelings about the Korean war. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Did you have any personal objections?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  The Korean war? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I theti — I thought it was a waste and I think many of us thought that. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It was — it was just everything went wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">We — we were fighting — we — we were fighting a war, but we weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I see the same thing going on right today in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , where we — we’re talking about fighting a war, we’re fighting something. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We’re not going in and cleaning it up, and that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The troops were ready, we were ready, but the command, the — the June 8, 1999 politics weren’t — weren — the pol-politicians weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It was a politician fought war. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And that is probably why two-thirds of us, of the officers quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That was not the ti — particularly those of us, and probably most of us at that time still — that had fought the — the war in — in Europe or in — in the Pacific for that matter, where you fought a war to — to win. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">There we didn't fight to win, we fought to — to sit around and let somebody do the talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And so now I — I-I did not think kindly of what was happening there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  What did you think about the developing Cold War?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  The Cold War, of course that was somehow predictable, that having met the Russians, we knew we weren’t going to be friends, although we were friendly and the vodka flowed freely, but that was not it, and then of course when the Russians dug in and said — and dictated to us practically what — what we — what we could do and what we couldn’t do, that was pretty much the beginning of the Cold War, and Churchill saw it and — and it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But there were — there were many things that — well, it was a political war, it was — and political wars don’t lead to anything, never have. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And there should have been some accommodation someplace, but nobody would give, we didn't give, they didn’t give. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And I think the only thing that — that — that could have ended — the way it ended was — it was completely unexpected, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The only other way would have been a — a hot war. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">June 8, 1999 Fortunately, it didn’t happen, but it was a bad time in history, I think, that whole period of the Cold War, because it had an influence on — on everything, on — on the lives of all the people in the world, on the economy and — so that it was — it was a bad thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  I’m going to ask you clarify the t — the term hot war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  The — the missiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The missiles were ready on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , we could have fired, they could have fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Any mistake could have triggered an annihilation of — of half of the world, and that was a great fear, I think o-of myself and I’m sure of most of the people, that some nut would push the wrong button, even by accident, not — it could have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">That it didn’t happen, was a miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  What comes to your mind about the time that you spent in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , other than that you met your wife and got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Well, I had gotten out of the army, I was a civilian in a culture that was strange to me, and so I — I soaked it all up. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I took it in and it was an interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And after about two and a half years there, I decided it was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Well, we both decided that was enough and let’s get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But it was — it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">There was nothing that stands out, just learning and looking at the ways of — of the mysterious east. </span><span class="sentence" id="479"><span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> was a loss, there was no — no — nothing there to look at, there was total devastation and — but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> and traveling around <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> June 8, 1999 was interesting, see how people lived, how — how they — how they managed, really, with their — their culture, the way of — of life, the way of living in — in [indecipherable] paper houses, and it was interesting, but nothing outstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Did anybody there know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Yes, they knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I had no problems with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We had a — actually the only Jewish services we had in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> were the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And in the <span class="BUILDING">chapel center</span> , we’d go there and they brought in a rabbi from someplace, not sure where he came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I went to services, and I took time off and my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , all the people I worked with knew where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So, no, there was no problems there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  You left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> after cruising around the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for about oh, a good two or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> where Barbara has an aunt and cousins and we stopped there for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> where she has another aunt, we visited there and I got introduced to the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And then we went to <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Webster City</span> , <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , a great metropolis of about 8,000 people and I met the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Parents knew who I was, I had written to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">As a matter of fact, just very recently I went through some papers that when — her mother died some years ago, but we had never looked through that file of June 8, 1999 papers that — that we had taken from her, and I looked through some paper and there was the letter I wrote to them when I first met Barbara — or wh-when we decided to get married, and I wrote to them and told them who I was, and got to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Webster City</span> and well, had parties and met — met the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And stayed there for awhile and then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> I was then for the first and only time — no, I ca — I — was not the first and only time, my first job in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was, course, I had to look for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> was the first time that I really had to — really had to look for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">There was no — no HIAS to — to help me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I had a — well, in — while I was in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , in — in — in my capacity as — in my job, I had very close contacts with the CIA people out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And so before I left the chief of the CIA group asked — said, why don’t you — when you get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , why don’t you just stop in and talk to the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langley</span> and come with us? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I said, well, that’s nice and he gave me a letter of recommendation. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And so I did and they offered me something that was not for me, they — they offered me a job in — in — a—a temporary job in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I wasn’t ready to go out — out again, I wanted to stay awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And so I didn’t take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And then again, by continuous luck, ran into a friend who said, well oh, I know of a new outfit that they’re forming at the — in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> and I’ve applied for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He was working somewhere in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He said, to transfer into it and they’ve got June 8, 1999 slots open, why don’t you try that? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I tried it and I got the job, became his boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">John has never forgiven me that, but we’re still friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And there I—I got the job with Air Force Intelligence and worked with them for oh, several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Got several promotions, I was doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Then our organization was taken over into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was formed, and that took in units from all the military agencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Stayed with them from ’62, I was involved in — in the creation of the new organization, was on that committee, and stayed with them until °65 when once again I was invited by the State Department to transfer to the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">It happened during a — a meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I was presenting a project that we had — a worldwide project of intelligence handling that we had, I was involved with through an inter — through an interagency committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The State Department representative said, would you be interested in coming to our — we have nothing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I said, well, make me an offer I can’t resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And he said the — about two weeks later, he made me that offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I transferred to the State Department in the foreign service and became a foreign service officer, coming in on top, which, much to the — 1n the foreign service that — yo-you’re — you’re not liked if you come in on top because everybody else came in on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So I had in- interesting experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  I have to pause to change tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">38June 8, 1999 End of Tape One, Side B June 8, 1999 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Charles Stein. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">This is tape two, side A, and you had been telling me about your changes in your professional life with the Air Force Intelligence and Defense Intelligence and then the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Could you walk me through some of those jobs and what your role was, your duties, responsibilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">In — I — I mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me about in the Air Force Intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">What happened was the air force was the, in 1955 was getting into the — the technological age of information processing. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They were the leaders in the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">They had come up with a project that was worked up with IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing where the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm, and at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the coding was then read electronically from the film, and would — and when you — when you got the right — right thing, looking for a specific document that contained a subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And that was on there, and that would — that then would print out the document that pertained to whatever you were looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">That was a — a new way of doing it, you didn’t have to have any June 8, 1999 — any input, typewriter input that you had until that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We had to type punch cards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come — you — th — this way you could just photograph it. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what they — they were hiring people to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">My job, I became a — I was hired as the chief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech — technical part, the — the contractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we’re do — and we developed — and again, we did this with the CIA, a— a code — a code dictionary, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence, would have a code number. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And then we would have — this was my section then, readers read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports from all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">That document would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and it was available for — for retrieval. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We had gotten that thing, it took a number of years to — to do this, we worked from ’55 to about — by ’58 or 59 we had the first installation, and it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I went out to help the installation of the thing at —- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Strategic Air Command</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and several other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and we started sending out copies of what we had made the film into those. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And those were little chips, photo chips that ran through just — June 8, 1999 similar to — to punch cards running through when you’re searching, but these were photo chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Or you could view it on a— on a microfilm viewer. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">That was the main project. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Now, it — we got into — more into different arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That unit then was taken over with a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was established. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on new developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It was all intelligence handling. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I was not, at that point any more directly involved with the intelligence, but with the technical operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And it was that, and DIA just a follow on to the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And it was that thing that State Department got interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate unit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they didn’t have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">As I found out later, they didn’t want any. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">The <span class="BUILDING">foreign service offices</span> , they didn’t want to have information. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He wanted to have what he had, his pieces of paper and he’d make up his own mind, they didn’t want anybody else to — to shove stuff at him that he didn’t see — had seen — hadn’t seen before, to change his mind possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Anyhow, that was an — that’s an interpretation. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But I got to the State Department and we started, there were about four or five of us that had been — some from the State Department and a couple of people from CIA, myself from the June 8, 1999 IAA, and one from USIA, and there was one other — a couple from the State Department, and we all sat and we started looking at what is it that the foreign service — tha-that the State Department needs in the — getting information. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Where do they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">In other words, we were systems development. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And we then got money through a — probably my most grueling and demeaning experience in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I had to testify before Congress, before a congressional committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It — the man, my immediate superior in that particular thing, was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He and I were sitting there, I was in the left hand seat. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The left hand seat 1s the — when you’re facing the committee is the — the secondary. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And a certain congressman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> destroyed my buddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The man was so confused he didn’t know what to say and the chairman of the committee excused him and said at this point you’re not answering any more questions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you’re excused, and he wal — had to leave the — the <span class="INT_SPACE">committee room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I sat there for the rest of it and I got through it and I got the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So — however, was an interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I was noticing that the chairman’s assistants, the — not a congressman, one of — his — his office manager, wi — whoever he was, had an interesting head movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And being a good observer, I had noticed that when they asked first June 8, 1999 questions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive answer to something, his head would go this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And when the congressman asked a trick question, the guy went this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So my eye was on him, and I got through the thing, it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I was right, that that was the way, that he knew — these people know the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">When they ask a question they know the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And so — they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it — that — that was — 1t was — it was a sad thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I came out and poor guy <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I asked him to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He wanted to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I said, you should go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="577">Il call you later, I'll tell you what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He said, but di-di — do you know what — I said, yeah, we got the money, we’re all — you’re all right, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I — I can’t even remember what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And very shortly after that he left the State Department, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back listening to this thing and they weren’t happy with him, so anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Well, we got the money and we had the department hire contractors, some of these big information processing firms. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">They came in and they started working on a program. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">The program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we showed that it was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">This time we didn’t have to testify any more, 1t was done in the higher-ups. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And they — let’s see, after about — it was about two and a half June 8, 1999 years into the — into the program, that there was an internal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Again, there’s a political thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant Secretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the — the enemy there, the other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer operation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Payroll and personnel and whatever, but never anything subst — substance — substantive 1n- information, they’d never handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But they saw something that hadn’t — that got money and all kinds of possible — and they wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Well, it was a time when my assistant secretary wanted another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He wanted to be a — what do they call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">A diplomat in <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We had — the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , they have a diplomat in <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> , that a — that’s a cream puff, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And usually that led to an ambassadorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">People who were s — who were selected for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Well, he was pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want — but there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things going on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn’t let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So he changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He sold us a — he sold my — my organization to administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I said, I’m not available for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">You can transfer it, but I’m — I’m out. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I— I wouldn’t work for those people, I — well, I knew them, I had worked with them before. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Well, he was friendly enough to say — he was Jewish, by the way, the only other Jew in June 8, 1999 the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And he said, I didn’t think you would, but I’ve got another job for you, if you want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We have a new inspector general and I’ve told him about how you go about doing your investigations and how you can do these things and — and he’s interested in you, because you’ve reviewed, you know what this whole department is doing, you’ve done a survey to — to find out what they need, and he wants to talk to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And he’s — he’s brand new, he just came an — an ambassador who just came back and got the job as Inspector General. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So I made an appointment, went to see him and he said, yeah, I want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I became a senior foreign service inspector. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Now again, I shifted jobs without try — even trying, you know, I — I— I was asked to. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And when I got into the Inspector General’s office, that I hadn’t used before, cause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in — in very good company, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for whom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And so they became inspectors and they traveled around from one <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> to the other, to make sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , mainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The idea I came up with, that sold m — sold me to — to the inspection corps was that there ma — are many things that are overlapping that are not being looked at in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , th-the various <span class="BUILDING">bureaus</span> , each one working as an independent thing, each one working with all the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> that their — you know, June 8, 1999 the <span class="BUILDING">European bureaus</span> , working with all the <span class="BUILDING">European embassies</span> , but there’s no — no connection between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They’re doing all kind — I said, I would like to look into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He said that’s a great idea, you got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So I started out on that and I became — I was doing — what’d we call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Well, the organizational reviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And I did some of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">As I went on, I did all the — the <span class="BUILDING">bureaus</span> , and particularly those that covered in substance more than an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">The scientific bureau — scientific and — and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attachés out there that weren’t talking to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So, there — it was a question of — of getting information to them and — I mean, getting information between them and not just reporting back to the <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> and the thing gets lost in the <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And the <span class="BUILDING">consular offices</span> , for — of course, there are consulates in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and more than there are <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , and they’re not talking to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They’re reporting 1n, it’s all a one way flow, nothing goes out — oh, excuse me — to — to all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And so I started working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me, some of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat down and we ju — started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we find out how things were and sort of rewrote the — the — the job descriptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The — the job [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, having been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at June 8, 1999 these various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">When I looked into that I found that the man was a political appointee. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">He’d made big contributions to somebody and he had a few people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , but his work was being done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at the U.S. mission to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">In the process I also found that there was a special assistant to the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Now here we have the international Red Cross, a British a — a Swiss organization, and they have a <span class="BUILDING">one man office</span> with one secretary who’s a special assistant and who handles contacts with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But the international Red Cross is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and who handles the — the br — the work? </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And this 1s a large <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the united na — in the mission to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The U.S. mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I found a third one, a-a- another special assistant for a humanitar — for — not for humanitarian, for disaster relief affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Again, all of them political appointees. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Well, I went — so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing and they were hardworking people. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They were doing the budgeting for — for these various operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They were representing the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> before the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and before all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I came back and I wrote a — oh, about a 200 page report. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">This was about a six months affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I wrote a rit — I wrote a report and I said, reorganize June 8, 1999 the whole thing and my s — my recommendation was that — to get another position as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under that subject heading and abolish these special assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> do the work and have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> have a — a regular <span class="BUILDING">office</span> doing whatever is necessary in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , such as you know, budget — getting — getting money and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And that was finished in 1990 — in January of 19 four — four — 1974, I finished that particular report. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And then I went on and was doing — I think the next one was consular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I get a phone call from the <span class="BUILDING">refugee office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The deputy to this political appointee was a regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And he calls me and he said, I have a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">We’ve seen your report and I think it’s great. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They thought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They were — they were the biggest one, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Anyhow, we tha — we thought we — we have a — we have a problem, our man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , our — the head of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> just informed us that he is retiring in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">This is about the fifth — I think it was the day after the Fourth of July weekend, I’d just come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And he said, you’re the only one who knows what’s going on out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">How would you like to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And my answer to that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don’t bother me with details, send five tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We had a meeting after that, he explained June 8, 1999 to me what this problem was and I said yes, Ill — PIl—I’ll accept and Ill go. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And six weeks later we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and I was running that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I’d gotten, of course, I was at the time — this — the main job of that particular <span class="BUILDING">office</span> really, was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">That was the beginning of the — the major exodus from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">What they were doing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary agencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration Commission, the World Council of Churches and many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">The — the Polish American refugee, or Czech American. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">All of those, all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">They — tho — they were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">All of them, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And were trying to resettle them in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went to these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their job, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the resettlement process. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and others, but mainly the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Went to one of my jobs and the family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , the kids were in <span class="BUILDING">international schools</span> , which was a good experience for them, and my job was making — reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They were all inflated, of June 8, 1999 course, the usual thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I was the first — first stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And — and actually, physically looking at them, periodically. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So every month I would be in one or — or two, I’d be in — in —in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and I’d be in — in— in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , where many of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , which were the main parts and occasionally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> is — it was another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Several <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where they — these people were, and working with them to expedite the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I had one critical, really critical thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">That was, the Kurds in <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> would not let them out and it was a long process and finally they wouldn’t let any — finally they decide that yes, they could leave and so we would — wanted to send in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and they wouldn’t allow us. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red Cross was going to send in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and they wouldn’t let them. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And finally there was a—acharter from — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lufthansa</span> had a charter service and the international Red Cross managed to get one of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and they gave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Now, these people were to be brought out, the — they — ere — ira — ara — Iranians gave in and let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The people — the — the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let these people into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but it expired on a certain date, which was about — we were one day away from that date when the thing — when the Iranians gave in and the Red Cross took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> over, got the people up and got them to June 8, 1999 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to work with our <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> to make sure that these people get their visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">It was just — they had to get their passports stamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">What ha — when they got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was unimportant, but before that date — oh, this was the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I get to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and they’re processing it, doing a good job, and they still got about a — about a hundred people at five o’clock in the afternoon, the consul — the U.S. consul says well, we’re gonna have to continue that tomorrow, we’re going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I said no, you’re not. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He said well, yeah, but you know, the day is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as I’m concerned it’s midnight in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And it is five o’clock and it’s noon, we got 12 hours to go, you’ve got to finish these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He says no, I can’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I said, I want a <span class="DLF">line</span> to the assistant secretary for consular affairs, whom I knew well. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I had done a job for her before I left and we had good — good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And he got — he says okay, so he got the <span class="DLF">line</span> through. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He couldn’t refuse me, so he got the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I talked to the lady and I said, I’ve got a reluctant [indecipherable] I’m — we’re doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah, how you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I said we — there’s still about a hundred left that have not, and — been visa’d and your man here wants to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he wants to close up. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">She said, let me have him. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I said — handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting longer and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we’ll work until it’s finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">June 8, 1999 Well, by about 10 o’clock that night we were finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Everybody had their visa, stamped with today’s date — with that day’s date and the next day we got them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and sent them to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> But those are the kind of things that you — the troubleshooting type things that — that you had to do every once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Had to intervene in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">The Russians in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> were treated very nice, they had them out on the — on the li — li — just like they have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> they had them out on the — on — near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lido</span> someplace — not <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lido</span> , whatever the <span class="DLF">beach</span> 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Nicely quartered. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Then you came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to — and HIAS was handling most of the Russians in th— <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And they walked in and he said — and their — their — their questions were, where is my money, where is my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where is my servants, where is my wi — the Russian way. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">The Russians were used to asking for some — the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The government gave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They were still in that mode. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And we had some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I told them, don’t be intimidated, you’ve got — they had Russian speakers there, and they were — I —I —I told them how — how to talk to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Just yell at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Tell them to go away, they get nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">One more word out of you and you’re out, you get nothing, you go wherever you want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And it — it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It worked, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Again, something they were used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The KGB wasn’t going to be — talk to June 8, 1999 them friendly like, so we weren’t either. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They had something coming to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We told them that no, you don’t have anything coming to you, we’re giving it to you because we’re good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And in that particular case, and there were a lot of them there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I represent — see, those were just an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">When I came, I was the United States government. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Well that — that made — that — that — that did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">When the government says you gotta be quiet, you’re quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So we’re — you know, it was game playing, but — 1t was — it was acting. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I did not go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">That’s — you know, experiences like that, that was — that was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And of course I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in some <span class="REGION">areas</span> , they were not too pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Some intellectuals, people with — who had status and — and now were begging, in effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I felt for them, but on the other hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So, you know, you treated them accordingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when I talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and look at me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">It’s gonna happen to you, just take it easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">It’Il be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We’re doing it, but it takes time. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And it helped a little, some cases, I — I hope it did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  I want to go ask you a few questions about the 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I know you’ve taken me professionally in your career through the 70’s, or through the mid-70’s at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I June 8, 1999 would like to go back to the 60’s and ask just some other questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">First of all, wanted to ask you about the Eichmann trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Did you follow the Eichmann trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I followed that again, with a vengeance, and I read everything there was, anything from the “Washington Post” to the “Jerusalem Post” and anything I could lay my hands on, because it was of great interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I had known of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eichmann</span> of course, like everybody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">By that time I had read most of the things that had been written about the Holocaust and about — about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I was hoping that it would lead to where it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And when they executed him, I — I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">It’s the wrong way to be happy, but I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Not, in that case, that was the exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Just like I did for the Nuremberg people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  The 1960’s were very turbulent years in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , a lot of changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I’d like you to reflect back on some of the things from the 60’s, like the — the Vietnam war an-and Civil Rights, and Women’s Movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Did you get involved with any of those, or are any of those of particular interest to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  No, I was — well, put this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">In 1965 — no, ’66, I’d just gone to the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">No, no, no, fift — ’65, I was still with the DIA. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I received a letter from the army, saying that the Secretary of Defense has declared your job an essential — a civilian essential position. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Therefore, you can no longer remain in the active reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I was still a reserve officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">By that time I was a lieutenant colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And I — June 8, 1999 i—1-— well, let me just quickly here, when I said I left <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and we said no thank you, we don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">When I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> I applied for commission again. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I decided I — I want to stay in, mainly because it — that pays, at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I had never known until 1957, approximately ’57 1s when I came back in, that <span class="BUILDING">reserve offices</span> who had active duty at age 60 would get money. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And I said well, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Somebody talked me into it, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Somebody told me about that, one of the people I wor — I worked with. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">They said, why don’t you come back in, and I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Myer(ph</span> ) and said, can I come back in? </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And they said, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I — I came — I-I was reassigned on the non-pay unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We met once every two weeks in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> for a couple of hours, get a lecture from somebody or gave a lecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And that was it, we got points, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So anyhow, in 1965 I got this letter saying that your — you’re essential now and you can’t be in the reserves any more, in the active reserve, but you have over 20 years, and so you have a choice to go in the inactive reserve or into retired reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> was just brewing and I said, I don’t want to get caught in another war. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Even — even then I might — this — this thing ad — ba — my civilian job might end, and I’ve had two wars, two is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> didn’t look like anything that I should get involved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And I said — I wrote back and said no, put me in the — 1n the retired reserve and I retired at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And at age 60, the checks started coming, which are still accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But June 8, 1999 anyhow, now <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> I did not like what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I couldn’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">There was — I didn’t think we had any business there. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And I had friends who were still in the service who went over there and they came back and they told me what conditions they — that they had, under what conditions they were there, and it was not what I — I felt that I was right, we shouldn’t be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I had — I felt for all the people that — that were against the war and all that, although you know, I was sort of a military something or other, nothing serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But that wasn’t it and many of the people I knew who were in the military and in the reserves and retired in the reserves all felt like I did, so I-I wasn’t alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I — I — well, we were right, it came out the wrong way at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  I’m going to pause now and change tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Charles Stein. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">This is tape number two, side B, and I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights movement and if you had any thoughts about it, especially in light of your experience in your earlier years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  You know, the Civil Rights moved me, I followed it very closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I didn’t do anything, I was not involved in anything, but it was on the right track, and I was June 8, 1999 very much sympathetic to it, because I’d been there and I thought that all the segregation an-and thing were — was — it was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I had seen it, I’d — in — in the military, and I — I'd seen it in the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Most of my early army posts were in the south and I saw how the blacks lived, or were forced to live, and they were forced to do whatever, were not allowed to — not really allowed to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And so yes, I was, as I said, sympathetic and I watched it and was happy to see that it developed into finally the — the schooling and the — the desegregation of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> particularly to start with and — and then the other things that followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">QUESTION:  By the 1970’s, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had already been involved in several wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I wanted to — to have you reflect on — on that aspect of it — Israeli history. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">The ’48 war, ’56, 67, °73, the — this — the wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  I was very much concerned and watching it very carefully, all the wars, the whole history of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">It was — well, it — it was the homeland for all those who didn’t have a <span class="REGION">land</span> and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And what was left of my family was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">My cousin, his mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And then a little later on, another cousin who had survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> that I didn’t know about then for — for some time, til after the war, quite a bit after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">She came to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So I had direct connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I also had some friends who had gotten to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> early in the — well, some left actually with their families in the 30’s, before the anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And others June 8, 1999 had gotten out in the tra — in the various <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> or in the illegal migration. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And so — and of course, they were my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I watched those wars and I followed them very carefully and was overjoyed with all the results, because each one of them was a victory. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I almost got involved directly in — well, I did get involved in a way, in the Yom Kippur war in ’73. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I was at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in ’73 on Yom Kippur, when the thing — th-the news came. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I remember it was in a Sunday, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And I had airline tickets to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">On — as a job, I was supposed to — I was still an inspector then, and I was to inspect the immigration policies of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , again ka — that was still during the — the time when I was working on the — on the refugee and the humanitarian affairs study. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And I was headed for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I was headed for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">| had two passports in my pocket, one for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and one for the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , because you couldn’t have a stamp then, and th-that — in the State Department we did all kinds of things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Two diplomatic passports and I just hoped that I remembered which pocket I had which one in when I pulled it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But I was to — to be 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on the — on the f — the following — well, I was leaving the following day, the day after Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And of course when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night, I called the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">War had broken out and there was no way to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I called the — the — the duty officers, and I asked them to get a telegram to our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> that — and — and also to June 8, 1999 <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> that because the situation that I was not coming and I’II let them know when I’m coming, it would be a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">If I had left a couple days earlier, | would have been right in the middle of — of a six day war. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But I — the Yom Kippur war, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">But I — I was just saved by — by one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I did get there again, oh, about the following month. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">It was an interesting thing, I had to go to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> and there was a — when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I said, well, I’m going to have to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and then fly into <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And they said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Said the <span class="DLF">Allenby bridge</span> , which is the famous <span class="DLF">bridge</span> where the crossings occurred, the — the exchanges and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">They said, we have a deal with — <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> really has a deal with <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> , war or no war. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We can get you to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and on — it was a certain day, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but the — one of the officers from — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amman</span> is coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and he — the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> will take him in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">They will cross — he will have to walk across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and we have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to pick him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So we’ll just tell the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in — we’ll just call Jordan, Amman, and we’ ll tell them that you’ll be crossing the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> at the same time, you’ll be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that — pick him up and they co — they’ll pick you up on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">You’re just gonna have to carry a suitcase by yourself across. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I said, well that’s no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And so that’s how we went a — went across that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And it was interesting, I got a trip through all of the — the <span class="REGION">territories</span> there, June 8, 1999 the new <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Well, they weren’t new any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">But anyhow, got there, got to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , went across. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Said hello to the guy who ca — came in from — from <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Went across and got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and got to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And from there I could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> and finished up my trip and then went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So that was an interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I didn't expected it to be that way, but I did get to use both of my passports.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  I want to get back to your professional life now, you had taken me up to the year 1974. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">What happened after 1974 in your professional life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  Okay, 1974, I was — I had finished the report on the refugees and so forth, and I got a phone call in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> asking — telling me — from — from the <span class="BUILDING">refugee office</span> that the — their man in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , who was really running the whole operation for all these different groups, was retiring. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">He had just informed them that he was retiring and the man called me, said you’re the only wa — you’ve — you wrote the — the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">We like your report and would you — how would you like to go and take over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And my answer to him was, please don’t bother me with details, send five tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And fi — six weeks later we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I took over that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and we had oh, about 20 or 30 people working in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">There’s a lot of bookkeeping — well, a lot of 1t was ha-handling the — well, okay, th - my — my duties were representation to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , to the appropriate <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of the June 8, 1999 <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , the high commissioner for refugees, the U.N. high commissioner for disaster relief, the international Red Cross and all the other international organizations that had any dealings with — with refugees or dis — or any of the human — humanitarian affairs, including the human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I had one officer assigned to me who was specially doing human rights work. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I concentrated on directing the United States refugee program, as it was called, and my job was to see that the U.S. funds that were going into the program were being properly used by the people who were actually operating the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And now those people were voluntary agencies, as we called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">HIAS, International Catholic Migration Commission, World Council of Churches, Polish American, Czech American refugee organizations, Tolstoy Foundation, in — in — International Rescue Committee and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They had places in various parts of Europe, where they would receive the refugees, they would come m — and those — this is the period when we had the Russian refugees coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">They were coming out between 20 and 30,000 a year in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">They would house them, feed them and process them and help them get to their final <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">We tried to get them to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but not all of them went. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Some — some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , others made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> was another major point. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Others stayed in Europe or some in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and various other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">But with all these people there was June 8, 1999 the need — the — needed money, and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> supported that. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">We also supported <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in the settling of the Russian refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">We supplied money for the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and teaching them language, teaching and whatever was necessary to ink — to get them into — into the main stream. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So my job took me to — to these — to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the — where the people were being actually processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I saw to it that our money was used properly, that 1t wasn’t wasted on administration or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We had all the — all these organizations also had their own funds, but you had to watch them, of course, you know, money — money is available so you use it any way you — you feel like it until somebody looks over your shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Also, I had to look at their — their annual budgets when they — their budgets would come to me, I would check it to see if it was justified and then pass it on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to present to Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I made the first corrections and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> cut some more, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">These — these things happened, of course, it’s the usual with the budget process. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">But the — the best part of that was I traveled and I — I saw a lot of these people and my points of travel were what — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , all hardship points — ports. </span><span class="sentence" id="872"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was a very heavy place, lots — many of them came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> because many of the organizations had their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for some reason or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Some came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And occasionally I would go — <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Tell me about your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">June 8, 1999
ANSWER:  My children. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I have three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Jeff was born in 1978, and well, having once been a medical student, I had an opportunity to read the book again and brush up, because a week before he was born, and he was about due, we had a snowstorm in — in — we lived in — over in the <span class="REGION">Alexandria area</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And our <span class="DLF">street</span> , there was a six foot snow drift at the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we were completely snowed in, there was nothing that could go in or out, and we were waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And so I was reading the book and said well, if it happens, I think I know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I remembered as a young medical student, as first year medical students will do, sneak into other classes, I went into one <span class="BUILDING">class</span> once where there was — this was an obstetrics class and they were observing a birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And so I saw that everything that was going on and I figured I can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Of course, I was scared to death, but Jeff was kind enough to wait for another week and by that time this — the <span class="DLF">road</span> was cleared. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Then four years later Jim came along and David a couple of years after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I had — when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , Jeff was going into his third year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , Jim had just finished <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and David was going into the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Yes, yeah, fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Anyhow, so they went to — no, he was going into the third grade, excuse me, he was going into the third grade, Jim was going into the — into th — Jim was going into the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I c — yeah, gotta figure this out, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I said it went backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And they went to an <span class="BUILDING">international school</span> , which was very June 8, 1999 useful, learned French. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Had an interesting one with our youngest one David, who was 10 years old when we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And after the — oh, about two-thirds down the first year, the French teacher called me at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day and said, you know, I can’t get anything out of David, he doesn’t do his homework, he doesn’t do anything, he won’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I don’t know what he knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I said, well, let me talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that day and we lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , it was a — a <span class="DLF">block</span> , four <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> around a big <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Was a — a beautiful thing and the kids were playing soccer down there and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and David was playing down there, they’re playing — they were playing soccer and I went down into the <span class="DLF">park</span> and I listened to — I was looking for David and I hear him talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And this kid is talking French to his buddies like a native. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And so aft — I let him finish the game and then they — when he came upstairs, I said, hey, your French teacher says you’re not doing any work in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And he said, yeah, well you — th-they have all this — this grammar and I don’t know anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I said, well, you have to study it. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And he said well, but I don’t need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I can talk French. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I said yeah, I — I just noticed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I didn’t know you could I had not noticed that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">So next day I called the teacher and I told her what he had — what I-I observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I said, please engage him in — in a conversation outside of the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and see — see what he comes up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">She called me that afternoon and she said, forget June 8, 1999 everything I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">He’s ok —I don’t care whether he knows grammar or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So that was an interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">The other two of course, also learned French and enjoyed — and first they were a little apprehensive when they got there, because they were in a strange <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and it — this was something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">When it was time to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they didn’t want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there and they had a — whenever I could — I told you that I had to travel quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Whenever I could arrange my travels when the kids were out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I would take the family along. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And so they got into a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">We got there and I let them go sightseeing or take a tour or whatever and I would be doing my — my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And then we’d come back and they had seen another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">We d — we traveled a lot, they traveled a lot and of course, what they — what got them about skiing, maybe I — did I mention that before when I — when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the day when I got the assignment in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I —I called my wife and told her, Barbara this — we’re — we’re going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , she said, great. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And I said, don’t tell the kids, we’ll tell them tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">So at dinner we’re sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I casually sort of mentioned, listen, how would you like — how would you guys like it if we got assigned to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And Jeff, of course who was a — all — all the kids were skiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I was a skier so I — I taught them early. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And I said — Jeff said oh yeah, yeah, skiing, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , yeah, that’s it, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And the other two chimed in, yeah, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">June 8, 1999 So, it was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">But then when they got there, of course, they were a little apprehensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We — when we got back they — they went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Jeff — oh Jeff, we bro — took Jeff back in ’56. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">He graduated in 1956 — ’76, yeah, 1976.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  What year was he born in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  ’58. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">He graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in ’76 and we — we had — we were on home leave, we had two months home leave, so we came back and we traveled all over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for a couple of months, and then dropped him off at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Virginia</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlottesville</span> , where he had been accepted earlier, and we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he then sort of became a jetsetter. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">About every three months he was in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And the way UVA works, we dropped him off en — end of August when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">In early December <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was out and until about the latter part of January, and he was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , he was off skiing someplace with his friends and girlfriends and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And in January went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">In early May <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was out and he was back for the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">So that was for a couple of years and he — he was very unhappy that we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">He liked that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  What are your children doing today?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  What did you tell your children about your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  For many years I wasn’t talking about anything about me, except when they asked a question, I would answer it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Did you — did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And that was about it, or a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">But is not until about the middle 80’s is June 8, 1999 when I — one day it sort of dawned on me — that wa — it came from some questions that I — a discussion we had with — with the kids, that they really didn’t know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">They knew bits and pieces of — they knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">They knew where I came from, they knew what I’d gone through, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">But just bits and pieces, and I decided that I needed to write this thing down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I was not consciously ever holding it back, it was just not — I just — somehow I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">It was — I don’t know what — what it was, but I won’t speculate on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">So when the time — at that time there was an immediate action. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">I went out and I bought myself a word processor and I hooked it up and I sat down and I started writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And I started writing every day from then on until I had it all on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And so I— I wrote my — my whole history up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">There isn’t much after that anyway, they know me since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And I made copies and they all have a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And then when I did the Shoah tape with you, s-soon as I got that in the mail, I immediately went down to the <span class="BUILDING">copy place</span> and had them copy me — make me three copies and th-they all have copies of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And since then, they have — they have asked a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">More detailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">That has gotten them to — on the track to ask questions.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">ANSWER:  Well, with the — mainly with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I’ve been there for over six years now, since before it opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I started on — to work on June 8, 1999 opening day in a <span class="INT_SPACE">hospitality suite</span> at the — at the [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">Plaza</span> where some of the VIPs were quartered and we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">suite</span> there where we — a— a-—a gor —<span class="INT_SPACE">aroom</span> there where we gave them tickets, gave them directions, told them where to go and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Then I had to wait a little while until I got into the business services training program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I’d missed the first class, so I got into the second — the next class and — later that year, ’93. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And I been there — I been there ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I worked at — two years on the volunteer advisory board, one year as its chairman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And have done a lot of, well additional things like studies in addition to — to my regular duties there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And it’s been — it’s been a useful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">It gives me a chance to talk to people and maybe add something to their knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">When people ask a question, I give them just a little more than they asked for, usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Except, of course, the main question, where’s the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I don’t do any more of that, I just point them in the right direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But on the others, if they want to know about where an exhibit is, I know they also want to know what it is about, and I find that most of them don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">So giving them that little extra information, satisfying to me, and from what I can see, to — with people, they like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Th-They — I get a special thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So th-that has been a — the other organizations, oh, I — I’m a member of the Friends of the Yad Vashem, but that’s strictly a — you know, a supporting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I send them my donation and I get their newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And the same for the June 8, 1999 American gathering of — of — what its — American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I’m not anywhere involved — not — not involved in any chapter of what — if they have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I contribute to them, and I think it’s a worthwhile thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I give them some money and I read their publication, but that’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I am not a joiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I’m -—I’m very selective in what I join.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">QUESTION:  Have you had some special moments or special experiences at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that you can share?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">ANSWER:  At the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Oh, many, many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I had — one of them, I was doing groups, which I — I do mostly groups now, because nobody else wants to do them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Now, I had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> group from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , a — <span class="BUILDING">French high school</span> students, most — all girls, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And one little girl said to me, with her teacher, they all spoke English very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And she said that her grandfather had — was in the resistance, he was Jewish, her grandfather was in the resistance, he had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">He had a gun, a rifle, something, that he gave to the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span> had given it to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and would I know where she could possibly find that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I told her, I said, when you get down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , when you make — go around the first bend, there are the resistance movements, you find the French resistance there, take a look there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">About two hours later, the girl came back with tears in her eyes, saying thank you, thank you so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">I found not only my June 8, 1999 grandfather’s gun, with his name on it and all that, with a label, but also some papers he had apparently given, some pa — passport — well, I don’t — I’m not sure what it — what it was, I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I looked at it afterwards, but I can’t — but some documents that are also sitting right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So she found her grandfather there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">It was — it was a heartwarming thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I had another one, I was loading the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> , and it was a quiet period, and I had a family coming in around — what looked like a husband and wife and two grown children, children in their 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And I directed them to the — to the I.D. cards and said, pick up an I.D. card. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">The man picked up an I.D. card, and the next — I was looking at him, next he said, oh my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I said, anything wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">He said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">We are from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I picked a card, this is a person from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I didn't know anybody was in the Holocaust in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in — from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> he lives in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">They looked like professional people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">But, and I-I-I said, well, th-that’s very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And he said, oh, when I get back I will — I will give this to the mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">We will — I will — will tell them that we — we have to do something, you know, a plaque or something for a person ah — we didn — I don’t think anybody even knows or remembers that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">I said, that’s wonderful, please do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And there were several other things like that that happened that are very nice to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I read — oh, well, an amazing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">One day I — Iwas —I was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">information desk</span> , and a man walked up to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And he looks at June 8, 1999 me and I looked at him and he — some [indecipherable] looked familiar, wasn’t sure what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">He said, you’re Stein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I looked at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I said, ve seen you somewhere, way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">He says, yeah, in [indecipherable] he started speaking German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Somebody I knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and as a matter of fact I also knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but we — he had — he changed comple — I-I don’t know, he — I guess I didn’t change much, but he recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I didn’t recognize him, but I had known him in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and — about 1939 — 1940, I guess, and then sort of lost track, I hadn’t seen him since about then — since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So we — we had a long talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Those are some of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Vis-Visitors, I have a — I have my own personal policy in — in — in — in visitor services. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">There’s no German or Austrian that comes to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> that does not go and see it, I don’t care whether there are tickets or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I always have some — my own tickets in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I always save some for just those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And I’ve had many cases where I — I think they need to go see, see their own history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Not mine, their history, now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And I’ve had some of them come back, f-find me again, look me up and — and thank me for — for letting them see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">They says, you know, we read a lot about it, we heard a lot about it, but not like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I said, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">It’s all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I enjoy working with groups, school groups mostly, where we go a little deeper into the — the subject matter, and I’m particularly 1-interested in the questions the kids ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And some of them are good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And then I have right now June 8, 1999 still — still there from last year, so I guess two years now, the artwork down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">concourse elevator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">The first thing as you walk in on the left hand side is that large picture of the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , the one I lived next door to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">The one I’ve been in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And so, after we — I tell them all about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I say, well while you’re waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , take a look at this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">It might give you something a little personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I was in that <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , I lived right next <span class="DLF">door</span> to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I been in there many times before the Germans moved in and after the Germans moved in, I was in there asking for permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And then I get all kinds of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Oh, were you there, oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> , fortunately take a long time to come down to — to the <span class="DLF">concourse</span> and so we got — have time to answer those questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Makes an impression, and it gives them one more <span class="NPIP">dimension</span> to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I also — 1 s — I — excuse me, I started this program, which they are n— are now continuing, o-of the — when I was on the — on the [indecipherable] of taking people through and having survivors telling their stories at certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> that they’re particularly — that they’re — were involved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And I just saw in those latest — you may have seen that — that they — Pete Philips is now going to do it this fall again for th-the paid staff of visitor services. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And they need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Paid staff 1s, you know, they’re — they’re the most temporary employees — o-of visitor services, are the most temporaries 1-in the June 8, 1999 <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">They come in, it’s their first job after <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and they can’t wait to get their one year in to get status to apply for another job <span class="NPIP">somewhere</span> , because they’re not paying them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">The pay is — is ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And so they’re not putting heart and soul into it like we do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">QUESTION:  Tell me about the exhibit of the 1936 Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  The what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">QUESTION:  The exhibit from the 1936 Olympics in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and what significance that had for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  The 1936 Olympics, that was in — oh, that was interesting because I found a picture in there of two — there was a picture of two Jewish swim — swim champions — Austrian swim champions that refused to go to the Olympics and they happened to be teammates of mine, I was a member of the same club and the same swim team. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And that was a real surprise when I walked by there and took a look at that, and here they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Interestingly, I had seen one of them on an Austrian video of former Austrians’ interviews, during an interview in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And I saw one of them on that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Of course, now I wouldn’t have recognized her cause she’s, you know, 50 years 0 — 60 years older than when I last saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And then about a few weeks later I go down there and I see the way I did recognize her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  What do you make of the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">June 8, 1999
ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">QUESTION:  The resurgence of interest in the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  Well, all I can say 1s it’s about time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">But it’s understandable that it wasn’t until some of the major institutions like re— Yad Vashem, and the <span class="BUILDING">U.S. museum</span> came into being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">That’s brought it — and of course that — that led to all the things that are now going on, the — o-of payments and — and restitution and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It was dormant too long, and of course in my own case, in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , the Austrians never considered themselves as the first victims until what, 1992 or ’93 when Chancellor Vranitzky said hey, let’s forget about that, we’re just as guilty as the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And then all of a sudden they said oh yeah, yes we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I-I mean, it — it took a long time and it is good because those of us who were there or were directly involved, we’re not going to be around for too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And now there’s a whole new generation coming up who will know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And I think that is important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  What do you say to Holocaust deniers? </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">How do you answer them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER:  I haven’t had a chance to talk to one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And I been thinking about that, what would I say to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And my first impulse is violence, do some violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">But I think the best thing I can think of is to ridicule them, say oh, you know all about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Well, I was there, so don’t you tell me it didn’t happen, because I was there it did happen, I saw it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And walk away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But th-th — yo-you can’t engage them June 8, 1999 in — in conversation really, because I think that is what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Don’t give them a platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">QUESTION:  Recently there have been some events that have echoes of the Holocaust and I was wondering if you would comment, or if you want to comment on the — the Columbine shooting, which was scheduled to take place on Hitler’s birthday.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  Well, there you have another Holocaust going, and I think it’s a — it’s awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I don’t, now that it’s almost over, I don’t see how these people are going to go back into what used to be their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And from what I understand, many of them don’t want to, and I don’t blame them, just like we didn’t want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">We could have gone back, I guess, and some few did, but not — not — not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">The same with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Those who go back, it’s gonna be hard to — to live with — with the people that — that kicked them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I don’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">You see, it’s a very, very difficult situation that they will — they are facing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Then again, knowing how it feels to take off and run and leave and — and get helped in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or — or — or another — or get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> someplace, or — or — it’s difficult.</span></p>
