ANSWER:  Well, I had lots of German friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I had little kids who played with me, and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me and we were -- sometimes one of my friends would go with me to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and I went with her to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My mother told me I shouldn't kneel down because that's not in my religion, so I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Nobody bothered, I don't even think they did kneel down. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Because I was always told, I remember that from way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But, but I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> Sundays and she went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We were really close friends, and she's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And she was happy that I did that for her, and I was happy to have her. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I never wanted to let her go, why let her go on Saturdays and why would she let me go on Sundays, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But it changed, it changed in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It changed a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">This particular friend didn't change too much, but I had one girl which really was my idol. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">She was extremely intelligent, and she was a little redhead and she was very cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And we played together, and at one point she said to me, "You know, Carola, I can't play with you anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I said, "How come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="113">She said, "Because you're a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I said, "What is that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="115">She said, "Well, have you heard of Hitler?" </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I said, "Yes, because every morning they used to say Heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And,, but why can't you play with me anymore? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="119">She said, "Because my father told me that you're Jewish, and Gentile children, Aryan kids can no longer play with the Jewish kids." </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And her father had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with my mother, and they were the best of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And that was very, very hard for an eight-year-old, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It felt very strange that suddenly -- and then the whole group disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Nobody would play with a Jewish child anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So then we sort of -- to the Jewish kids, we were friendly with the Jewish kids, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So then we were all Jewish kids, and we stuck to one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  When that young friend said that to you, was that the first time that you felt. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Felt there was something -- I was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I couldn't, and I couldn't understand why I was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Well, I was asked before by someone why was I different. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Did I feel any different? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You know, we did speak Hochdeutsch’, which is the better German. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So did that girl, this Lucy, Lucy, really, she spoke Hochdeutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Only the farmers had a dialect, and we never did have a dialect. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So I felt was that the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">No, it wasn't the difference, because the teacher spoke Hochdeutsch and so did the pastor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , speak Hochdeutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So we were -- I was very upset that suddenly they would make such a difference and make us feel like outcasts, and it got worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was just -- that was only the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Did it affect <span class="BUILDING">school</span> right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Not right away, because we were pretty good students, especially my sister was an excellent student. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So the teachers couldn't right away throw us out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because we sort of held the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But there was a time where it was impossible, it was only Heil Hitler and there were these songs which I really can't translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But in German it was ‘“Wenn’s Judenblut vom Messer spritzt’.” </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Jewish blood runs off the knives, then we feel better. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Just songs like that, and we felt very, very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We were little kids and yet when we looked around and we seen the BDM’, that's a circle of German girls who had these nice outings, we felt so why can't we be part of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Why can't we? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">As a matter of fact, I remember at one point when I walked through the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> -- we lived right next to the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> -- everybody said, "Heil, Hitler" like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I did, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">What did I know? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So my mother said to me, "You're not supposed to do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I said, "Why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="154">She said, "Haven't you been told that you are Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I said, "Oh, I forgot." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So it was very hard to comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I couldn't get it together that I was suddenly Jewish and I couldn't do whatever I did before. * </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Standard German (German) ° When the blood of the Jews sprays from the knife (German). * </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Bund Deutscher Madel [League of German Girls] (German); branch of Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But, they told me quickly that...
QUESTION:  That must have been very frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  It was very frightening, and, especially for an eight-year-old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">If you're older, you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But it got worse and worse, and by the age of 11, my parents decided that they couldn't leave me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Neither myself nor my sister, and they would send me to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">In the meantime they had made <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where only Jewish kids went. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And so, therefore, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> , which was <span class="BUILDING">Bad Nauheim Bezirkschule</span> ’ in the district of the <span class="REGION">area</span> where some of the children came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and some of them stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I was sent into the <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I was very homesick, and my mother and father had a hard time getting me there, but once I was there I was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And my sister went -- went,, she's a year older -- she skipping already, I don't know, in one grade here and there, went straight to a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That was a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> , so she went there and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  So what year, do you remember what year it was that you went?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Yeah, always, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And my sister, although she's only 15 months older, she always was, like, she gave me strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I, I made believe like she was 100 years older, and I would say to her, "So, what's going to happen to us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She says, "Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I don't know why you're worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It's going to be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We'll live, we'll survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So I figured if she said so, I'll probably survive and went on with that thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Did your parents tell you this? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean...
ANSWER:  My father, my father was a very -- he was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He would say, "I went through World War I, and the Germans are really not bad people. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And you're a young girl, and they're not going to kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Don't worry about it, you'll be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You'll absolutely fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Hitler will disappear one of these days, and you're going to be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Just hold out, don't let them make you crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Be strong." </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And he had all these quotations from Schiller® and Goethe’ and all kinds of things telling me that never do anything wrong. “</span><span class="sentence" id="193">Rather suffer, but don't do anything wrong.” </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Which in German is, “Lieber Unrecht Leiden als tun.*” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And he left me with all kinds of legacies, and I really, I, I lived through this on my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I listened to ... he ° <span class="BUILDING">District school</span> (German) ° (Johann Christoph) Friedrich von Schiller ’ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe * Better to suffer injustice than to cause it (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="197">was a very bright man. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And,, at least of everybody feels their father's superior, but he had a strong mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And he kept saying that definitely we'll get through that easily, and we don't have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We can stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , not to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So what was I supposed to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I said “okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Little did he know what was in store for him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  No, there was no particular effect, not on us personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We went about our way like I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet and, but no, not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I mean, I was absolutely away from everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">You know, I was all on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , of course, I was together with other girls, and we formed close ties; we really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We had no other choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">All we had was each other, and we didn't know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Their parents were also taken, so, we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We had to really stick to one another and bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Can you describe those relationships, what kinds of things you did together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Well, we were -- the more religious girls would eat together, you know, and I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And a little bit, I think, I was an outcast because the others always thought I was a little bit too religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I really wasn't, I was just observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">That was how I was brought up from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But other kids really didn't care about religion, the other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They did whatever they had to do, so I made sure not to eat meat and things like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">If there was meat available, I stayed away from it, I didn't -- I was very kosher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Now, this is interesting, because when you talked about your childhood and when your friends wouldn't talk to you anymore, you said, "But I didn't think I was Jewish."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I didn't think I was, but kosher I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  I see, so it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">You had a certain set of traditions that you followed that were habitual?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was very much accepted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nieder-ohmen</span> , very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Because on Passover, we would hand out matzos to our Gentile neighbors and friends, and they in return would give us eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I very often went to my friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they had these beautiful salamis hanging in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">It looked so good to me, I asked my mother many a times, "Why can't I just have a sliver?" </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And she said, "It's not kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">It comes from a pig." </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So that was it, it was a no-no and I lived by the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Now, when you're in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , was that harmful in any way? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I mean, are you getting weaker because you're not eating some of the things that you weren't?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  Well, we were young, 15 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">No, I wasn't really that weak, but I missed my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I missed everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But, you know, there was one thing we were young, and I think that really helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Because when you're young, you always feel that something better is going to come, and it will eventually be good again. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And we really didn't think of the worst, none of us did. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We thought, “Eventually this will all end and we are going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, and we'll be free.” </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But it didn't come to that, never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Were you praying with these young girls, as well eating together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I prayed for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They didn't do much praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But I had one girl -- two other girls who were equally religious, and we did a lot of praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But the other girls really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They sort of looked down on us a little bit like the frumis -- frumies'* you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">That was done, but it didn't bother us a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Now, did sometimes difficult things happen so you had to really help each other, not simply support each other spiritually?</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="707">A Koje is like a board. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">There was one on the bottom; there was one on the top, and I think there was a third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We had no straw, we had no blankets, we had nothing and it was February. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They took away our clothes, but I do remember they left me with my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I was a kid, I didn't know -- I had shoes, very simple shoes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> three days and the soles had separated from the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So I found a rag someplace and tied them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It was quite a few weeks I walked barefoot in February. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">There was snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I put all kinds of -- whatever I could find on my feet just to stay warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And so they did put us into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And then every morning we had zahlappell** which is the roll call, and there was usually SS men or SS women that came. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We stood there sometimes for hours in the freezing cold, so some of the girls already died right then and there because it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Couldn't take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Food, we hardly got. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And really, I mean, they were falling down left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So standing there -- then, one of the SS men would come and make a selection, and most of the time that was Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And he would go to say -- he didn't like the face, he didn't like what you looked like, and he says, "Come on out. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Come on out. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Come on out." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So I remember that so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">You know, I was brought up very religious, and the prayer you say when you die is “Shema Israel~’,” so every time he came around, I would just stand there and say my prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And luckily I was never taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And I used to tell my friends, "Do what I'm doing." </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I was such a religious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Well, it worked for me, it didn't work for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So it went on for weeks and weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">We marched out in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We went to build <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and then the SS men came with their dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And if they didn't like you -- but who you -- liked you? </span><span class="sentence" id="738">You looked like an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They would just say, "Go, run after her. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Go ahead and take the dog." </span><span class="sentence" id="741">The dog would bite you. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I have a few bites on my legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And, you know, by then you were already every day you looked skinnier and skinnier. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">There was nothing left of you anymore, and then suddenly I noticed I was getting typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I started to -- couldn't control my bowel movements anymore, and I felt this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I'll probably lay down like the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">By then most of the girls had already -- the first four weeks were the worst, and I probably won't be able to make this. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But then I remember my father said not to give in. “</span><span class="sentence" id="749">You've got to be strong.” </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And at night I used to hallucinate and, you know, there was no Schindler ’, no Schindler's list or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">If anyone would help you, it was the girl who laid next to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">She would say, "Here, look, I give you a piece of rag to clean yourself off, and I'll take your bread." </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Well, I much rather gave her the bread, clean °° Bunk (German) * Roll call count (German) > Hear, O Israel (Hebrew); declaration of God’s unity and watchword of Jewish faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">° Oskar Schindler myself off, and be okay the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But it was horrible, I screamed for my mother, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">There was nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I was a young girl, I just felt somebody should listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I really would say the first four weeks, if you held out the first four or six weeks, you were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I think I did, I held out those weeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  And where were you building these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  We walked out -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We walked out, we walked in at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Quite a distance, it must have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswiecim</span> , in someplace there. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And, we, you know, we carried the stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">If we had sort of a jacket, we had to turn it around and we put the stones in there and carried them. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The buttons in the back, and that's the kind of work we did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  Yeah, right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">The first four weeks, I was doing that kind of work and that was the time when I started having typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I was so sick, so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And I went -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , there was this so-called LagerstraBe,”’ the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And there was the LagerstraBe where our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was, and I -- it was close to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And I walked to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and I found some coal on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And I always heard that coal will stuff you up if you eat coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And I had a little bit of medical knowledge, not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Coal will stuff you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">No matter what, what could have happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I found a piece of coal in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I ate the coal, and I found a piece of lemon peel near the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I took the piece of lemon peel in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I ate the piece of coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And water we didn't have, but we had the snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I ate the snow, and I swallowed that and I got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And every time when I felt faint, and I had that piece of lemon peel in my pocket for all the years I’ve been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and every time I felt faint, I took that lemon peel. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And, you know, there's always a little something coming out yet -- no matter how long you have a lemon peel in your pocket -- and I could smell it, and I felt like -- relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So the lemon peel and the coal got me out of my dilemma. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And then one day, they were taking all the so-called fryz] erkas~* which I didn't know at the time what that meant, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And they needed new ones in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I didn't know what that meant, and they had selected already about six; they needed a seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And this girl, Sheyna was her name, stood next to me, and she said to me, "Pick up your arm." </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And I said, "Now I’m not -- what is a fryzjerka anyway?" </span><span class="sentence" id="795">She says, "A fryzjerka is a beautician." </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I said, "But I'm not a beautician. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I, I don't know how to do hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I can't do 7 <span class="DLF">Camp street</span> (German) *> Hair dresser (Polish) that for the SS women." </span><span class="sentence" id="799">She said, "Oh, keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Just give them your number." </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So she took my hand, and she said, "37468, she's the seventh fryzjerka. “ </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So the girl in charge took my number down and that made me the fryzjerka, which is a beautician, but I didn't have to do the SS women. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">All I did was cutting the hair of the people who came in the same way they had done to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Now, that was a very devastating experience, since lots of transports came in and lots of friends of mine came and I had to cut their hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And I kept telling them, like Zippy had done previously to me, "Do what they tell you and don't make noise." </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And I did tell them, and their hair was cut and I did that for quiet some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">That somehow made my life a little better since it was indoors. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Then after a while, they replaced us again with other girls.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, they didn't train me, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Well, everybody knows how to use a clipper, and you just cut the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I really didn't do too much hair cutting. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I did more of the body -- the bodily hair, you know, under the arm, on the bottom part. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And it worked for a while, it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Then they replaced us again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  Wait, wait, wait, wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">This couldn't have been very easy for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  It wasn't easy, but it got me out of the Aufenarbeit,”’ going, marching out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> every day and <span class="BUILDING">building barracks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">QUESTION:  Were there rules that you weren't allowed to talk to the women who came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">ANSWER:  We were mainly supervised by Kapos, women who had been there before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Well, they could have been miserable and started hitting each and every one. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But whoever came and started to rebel, we would tell them, "Don't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Just have your hair cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It's not the worst." </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And people -- only some people would say, "But my husband is Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Why should you cut my hair?" </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And then the whole thing started to explode a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I watched this for quite some time, and it was horrible. *” </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Outside work (German)
QUESTION:  Did you see Zippy again there in that <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Zippy always worked near the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">She would work in the political -- she would come by, and she would ask questions and she would come around. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And she would talk to the newcomers, because Zippy speaks more than one language. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">My language was German, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And that was a bit hard, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Speaking -- you know, speaking German only was for the other inmates like I spoke the language of our enemies, you know, of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So many a times, they thought "Are you Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I said, "Yes, Iam." "</span><span class="sentence" id="843">How come you speak German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So, you know, for survival you do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It didn't take me long, and I learned how to speak the Slovak language. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I spoke it so well -- unfortunately, I don't speak it anymore -- that I went after the war to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and they thought I was born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So I learned a different language, and it got me a little further, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  Now, how about the other women who were cutting the hair? </span><span class="sentence" id="849">You knew them...
ANSWER:  Well, I got to know them, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I got to know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Well, this little girl, Shayna, who took me in and said, "Take her number," I worked with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And she spoke Yiddish only, you know, and she had a little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">They were beauticians. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They were manicurists and beauticians, but I was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And I remember that was my first experience I had with Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Now, Yiddish sounds pretty much like German, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">A little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">For a Yiddish-speaking person, the German is like a distorted Yiddish, but for a German- speaking person, Yiddish is a distorted German. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So I, that's when I learned how to speak Yiddish, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So I learned two languages in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Now, why did you decide to learn Slovakian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  Most of the girls, like Zippy, they spoke so many languages, and they spoke Slovak, and you know, it's a Slawisch - language. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Once you know how to speak the Slovak language, you can understand Polish, too, so I understood a little Russian, a little Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I understood quite a bit, so it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Except for Hungarian, that language I could never catch on. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">That was too much for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  Now, you knew a young woman named Rose Farkas, who was also cutting hair.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION:  So how did they take care of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  Well, that's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I'll make it as short as I can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  No, don't make it short. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">That’ okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Well, when I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> , you know, I couldn't hold my stool because I had diarrhea continuously. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And the Kapo of the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> was a German woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">She was a lady of ill repute, so she was not very nice or very neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And she had nasty things to say, and when she seen that I was just a -- I couldn't walk anymore, and wherever I went -- I hate to say it -- but something dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The girls would just take a pail of water and wash it away, and she would say, "So what's wrong with that one here? </span><span class="sentence" id="888">She belongs to <span class="BUILDING">Block 25</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="889"><span class="BUILDING">Block 25</span> was the death camp -- death block. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And the girls said, “No, no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">She is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Not to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">She is working hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Nothing." </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And they protected me, you know, they protected me from all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Why, I don't know, but I really, like I said, I was a young kid and they were all a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Zippy 1s maybe about seven years older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So they felt they had to rachmones” with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And, of course, you know I didn't speak exactly the way they...
QUESTION:  So this went on for a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  It went on for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">You don't -- it helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">The coal, the lemon peel, that was my medication, and it helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">It helped me to survive for quite some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  Did you think about going to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">That was a no-no. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">If you went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , you stayed there because you would never go out again, no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So I had to, because my father had said, "You have to survive, and you will survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And I had that in me that, “It's going to be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Just don't give in to them, you're going to make it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  So, now, they took all of you who were so-called “beauticians” -- what a strange name -- and put you into another Kommando? * </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Mercy, compassion (Yiddish)
ANSWER:  I don't know whether they took all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I believe when the Greek transports came, like this Rollie and Stella, they were beauticians. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They took them into that Kommando, but I was out of the Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But I went, instead of cutting hair, I went to the Bekleidungskammer, ” which was close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">There we cleaned the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">It was like a cleaning outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We, people were getting undressed, we had to sort their stuff and then put it through machines and -- called the Entlausung.”* </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So I worked there for a while then. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That also better than going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and building barracks.</span></p>

that was to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Stick to one another and survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And there was one thing I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I think they must be from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , maybe from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the name of Carola Stern, and that person must have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And she got some sardines from the Red Cross from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and she was no longer there, so they gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">This was the most fortunate thing I had, so I had about four cans of sardines, and I could buy myself, you know, a piece of bread or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They also gave us a piece of salami, like once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And being that I was so Orthodox, I wasn't going to eat it, I exchanged it for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Later on I found out that I didn't have to do that, I could have eaten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">But that was my religion which wouldn't allow me to eat any unkosher food, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">QUESTION:  How did you wash?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">ANSWER:  Well, you had to keep yourself clean; otherwise, you had lice and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So we went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> , whatever water kept running there, we did wash ourselves off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">But the toilet conditions were terrible, you know, it was an awful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">But if we got to some water or even during the snowy season we would take a little bit snow, and we would let it stand in our Schiissell*® or whatever we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And we had some water, we kept washing ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Well, we did not have our periods, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">So we were not women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Obviously, they had put something in the food which women did not menstruate anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So we were easy to keep ourselves clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">They did that, I forgot what they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Some sort of a solution they put in the soups to make the women sort of leaner and no desires or anything like that.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Slovaks with them and Polish with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">I didn't see it, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">I seen two sisters fighting with one another, and that was my first experience with the Yiddish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And I couldn't believe it, like, they were very good with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">They were really very sweet people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">They were beauticians, and one said to the other, "You, you zolst vaksen vi a tsibele mit kop in der erd.""” </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Which I translated that in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I was horrified, that's when I learned to speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">That means, “You should grow an onion with your head in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">That was a curse if you ever heard one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">So I spoke to her and I said, "Why would you say that?" “</span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Because she did such stupid things.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">I don't know what she did, but there were two sisters, so it couldn't have been all that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">But things like that came up, you know, where two sisters would fight with one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">We were only human, you know, no matter what the situation.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">QUESTION:  Did he help you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1452">ANSWER:  He helped insofar if I tell the story now, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">When the transports from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I thought -- that was in June -- no, that was in August 1944, I thought that my parents would be still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And I said to myself, “Nothing can happen to me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">If I see the Obersturmfthrer” -- and I forgot his name — “I would go to him and I'll ask him if he can bring my parents into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> provided they are still living.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">So as I walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I see this Obersturmfthrer walking, and I went over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And then -- we were talking about how do you address an officer -- I went over to him, clicked my heels, and said, "Herr Obersturmfthrer, sieben und dreising vier acht und sechzig, meldet sich."”! </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Which means "37468 makes herself known." </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">He says, "What do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">with a very stern voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">And he said, "And how come you speak German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">I said, "I'm from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> ," which I really wasn't, but Nieder-ohmen, nobody would have ever known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I said, "Well, I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I wanted to ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">Do you go to the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> to get the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodzer ghetto</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">He said, "Yah, yah." “</span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Yes,” he says, "why would that interest you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">I said, "Because my parents have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédzer ghetto</span> since 1941, and since the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> are coming now into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I would like to ask you if it's okay with you, sir, to bring my parents into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">I'm here two years, and if that's possible, please do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">So he looked at me like I was nuts, like chutzpa of a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And he said, "Your parents, where are they?" *</span><span class="sentence" id="1471">° should grow like an onion with your head in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> (Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">>! </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Mr. Lieutenant Colonel, 37468 reporting (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">I said, "Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmannstadt</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">He said, "Well, no, you can't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">But if you know of a man who can -- if you know of a man, he can go." </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">So I knew this man by the name of Bumeck Stern, same name as mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And I knew him, and I said, "Yes, I do, and if the officer allows me to, I will get him." </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">And he took this young man to the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> and this Bumak called out the names of my parents and my sister, and they weren't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">There was no, no response. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">So he came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Occasionally, he would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">He wasn't in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know, and he said, "There was no response. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">I don't think your sister, nor your parents are alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">So I had to deal with that, I figured “that's it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And then transports still came in...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1504">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1505">ANSWER:  I, I, didn't give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">I thought maybe the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">We didn't go to every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , maybe the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">So I, I didn't give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">And in July -- in August 1944, another big transport came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmannstadt</span> and I walked through the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> thinking that if my mother -- my father wouldn't have been there anyway -- and my sister would be there, I would just see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">My mother at that time was still a young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Maybe she was 41, 42 years old, and she was tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">She looked tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">And I walked through the <span class="DLF">aisles</span> where people the came in and their head -- their hair was already shaven, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">They already had -- no, they didn't have a number on their arm yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">They were about to be bathed or whatever, showered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">And as I walked through the rows, through the <span class="DLF">aisle</span> there, I hear a tiny voice say, "Carola." </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">And I turned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">It was my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">And the reason she recognized me, it's a very interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">When I as a child, I had a way of bending my arm completely back, and I walked like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">She knows, I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">She seen a woman walking, a girl walking with the arm like that, and she said to her -- a girl was standing next to her, "This is my sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">She says, "What are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">This couldn't be your sister." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I noticed the arm," she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And, and when I turned around after she called, "Carola," it was my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">And we hugged ** Irma Grese > Josef Kramer and I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">And that's where Grese was, Grese, “the Beast of Bergen-Belsen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">She witnessed this thing, she seen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And she stood there and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">Something nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, "Carola," she heard my sister call "Carola"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">She said, "You don't have to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">Your sister is going to stay with you now." </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">And we hugged again, at least we are together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And whatever happens, we are together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And she said, "Okay, there is nothing to worry about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">Your sister is going to be with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she had to go through all kinds of different routines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Having, being tattooed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">She was tattooed on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a tiny little tattoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And I thought we would be together, but 1t was just a false promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">They sent her to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and I didn't know where she went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And once in a while, one of my friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where she was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And she would come back, and she says, "Your sister is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">Your sister 1s still alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">She was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and, I would hear from her once in a while. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1547">Not to worry, I'm still living." </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe the Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">But there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">So it went on,, the march that was in 1944 in, in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">1945 in January, the big march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> started, and I didn't know where my sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">I didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">She was already so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">She would have been killed already then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">So we marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> day and night, and late night and day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And we were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> we stayed four weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">I didn't know where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">We marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> we went supposedly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">We did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> , there was another march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> day and night, day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And I was already so weak, and we all were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">One helped me on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the other on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and we slept walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it lay down and they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just night then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">So at one point I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And I went out of my <span class="DLF">line</span> and there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , but there was <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">So I went into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">I said to the girls, "I have to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , it's impossible." </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , I walked into <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">My sister walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And so I said, "Now, you're not going to be out of my sight anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">You're going to be with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And we did cling to each and she walked with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">And we stayed together from that day on ‘til we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> , we stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">We were never separated anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">So that was one good thing that I had to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">That was a very unusual incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">So from the march on, we marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">That was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we hardly got any salt in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">But I had a chance to work in their <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> what I did there is I did heat the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> the to make the fire underneath, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little bit of farina. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">Not farina, oatmeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was with me and Martha. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">Two of the girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> survived with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">We were together, and I had a chance to give them a little extra soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">I added a little hot water and it was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">But we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">But that's where we laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and talked about better times which we felt we will never see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">And across from us was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">It was just across from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">They were also laying around, like, you know, like, like dead animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">You know, when you go to a <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> and sometimes and those animals look like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">We were just either waiting to die or being liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">And then that was in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">Maybe the Russians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">Nobody knew anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">All of a sudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming, "Get out of here you dirty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">Get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">Walk." </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">Now, we figured “where are we walking now?“ </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">We could hardly move anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">They walked us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">We were so sure that in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> they were going to shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">Because it was coming closer, the war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">And why in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">So they marched us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and all of a sudden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was it -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">I think it was May the 3rd. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">They all disappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">They were either they had their private uniform, their clothes in a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">The SS men disappeared; there were none. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">And all of a sudden we see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, "You guys are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">Hitler 1s dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">You're free, you're free." </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And they had -- I remember they had chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">There was a quite a few of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw it out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and they threw it down for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my sister looked at me and said, "Did you hear that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">We're free." </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">I said, "Yes, but where are we going to be?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">We were free, we were happy, but no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">But, we had more than other people because we had each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">So while we were sitting around in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we all got together and, “We got to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">Where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">We're not going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, "I lost two sisters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1853">She has a number on her arm." </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">There weren't too many of us at that time in 1946, and I felt very isolated, very lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">And if you wanted to tell actually what happened to you, people used to say, "Don't tell me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">I won't sleep tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">I don't want to hear your story." </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">I mean I didn't tell people on <span class="DLF">subways</span> , but my own relatives -- they were awfully nice to me, they were really good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">But they didn't want to hear our stories because they were getting on in years, and they didn't really want to be bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">My aunt, I told the story, and then, “It's enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">I won't sleep tonight.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">So, therefore, no one did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">Of course, we were not American citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">We couldn't afford a psychiatrist or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">We were just -- we were just people who had to get into the mainstream of life, you know, and we tried very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because the war had ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">If you spoke German, they looked at you like you were a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">So we had to speak the language which was good, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">And we got together with our own people, people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">And very often I heard from people who had come here previously, I heard them say, "Well, these people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they behave awfully strange." </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">And I'm a sensitive person, I didn't like to hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">We did behave awfully strange, but nobody took in consideration what we had actually gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">So it got to a point where we sort of separated ourselves from everyone, and we said -- we got together on social occasions, only the survivors, the ones who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">But we went to work and we started a new life, and we got into the mainstream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">And I went, -- I knew how to sew which I had learned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">I went into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I made piecework, worked in a <span class="BUILDING">blouse factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">And it was in 1946, 7, I made $80 a week, which was a fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">And everyone around me hated me because at that time we were piece -- they were pieceworkers, and if you worked too fast you ruined the prices for the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">I did it as fast as I could because I wanted to make money in the worst way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">So that was pretty tough, but I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">I mean I had an average of $60, which was pretty nice in 1946 and seven when really people didn't make too much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">And then I paid the money to my uncle and aunt who let me stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">You know, and my aunt cooked for me, and I lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">And it was very cozy and very nice, and then my husband would come and take me out for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">My husband, he wasn't -- he was just a boyfriend -- would take me to the movies and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">And from then on, life got a lot easier for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1888">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">Were you able to?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1891">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1892">ANSWER:  I didn't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">The only schooling I had was going to a parent's class when I pregnant with my son to learn how to be a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">That was also not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">You see, when you're young and you don't have a mother and don't have a father, and people sort of -- you had to do it all on your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">But we did it, we really worked hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">We helped one another. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1898">You do it this way, I do it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">You bathe the baby.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">I took the mother's class -- yeah, that was the only schooling I had because I had to make a living; I had to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1901">QUESTION:  Were you -- of the two sisters, did you get pregnant first? </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">Or did your sister get pregnant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1903">ANSWER:  My sister got pregnant and she lost the first baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">I was really the one who had the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">My son was the firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1906">QUESTION:  And she helped you, as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1907">ANSWER:  My sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , so she couldn't really help too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">They separated us, which we didn't really like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">But my sister went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> again in <span class="BUILDING">business college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">Some other relatives of ours lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , and so she stayed there and she met her husband there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">So it was all for the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">She had hers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , and she still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">She ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1916">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1917">QUESTION:  I don't know if it's the most formative years, but 1t certainly 1s an enormously significant part of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">How do you understand your adjustment? </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">Your coming back to life after all of this happening to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1920">ANSWER:  You know, there is such a thing, I guess it's called a “survivor.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">You just do it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">You don't think about, you just do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">We had, we had such a strong will to survive in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">When we -- once we were liberated, it was a piece of cake, you know, and you don't think about it too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">You just go ahead and do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">Don't talk about it and do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">But when I think back now -- I'm an old lady, and I think back at the time, the hard times we had, I sometimes don't understand how I survived it and how I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">And how I -- later on we had the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and I worked there, and it was all completely strange to me, <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and whatever, but I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">And whatever I did, thank God, I was pretty good at it, so they tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">So, at least I know some through <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and my daughter or whatever, it was hard work to do all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">And we wanted -- they denied us a free education in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">Maybe I could have gone to <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> , but I didn't have the means and have the money, and so I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">But I wanted my children to have the education that everyone deserved, so we worked, both my husband and I, we worked very hard to get our son through <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and the whole thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">So you just, I would say, get up and do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">Don't think back what has happened, don't have pity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">Don't look, look in the past, look 1n future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1937">QUESTION:  Is that what you learned from all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1938">ANSWER:  That's what I learned from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">And the other day my, my son was -- since we talked about tt, my son was to make to speech how it was living with a mother who's a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">And, you know, come to think of it, he said the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">He said, "She didn't look back and she didn't live in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">She lived in the present, and she lives in the future." </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">And, we never discussed the Holocaust in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">We didn't cry -- if I cried, I cried on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">I never showed my kids that I was a poor Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">They never knew about that, I used to pick him up when he was a baby and I used to hold him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">And I used to say, "They're never going to take you away from me," you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">And I really thought I had created something here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">You know I wanted to really hold onto him, and that he didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">I only knew that he was so dear to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">Once I had this little boy in my arms, I thought the world belonged to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">And then another little girl, it was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">But I went on with life and didn't look back and I think I accomplished, after all this horror, I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">Not quite, but I'm not finished yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">And like I listen and read the stories and I hear these kids saying -- of course, they're right -- they keep saying, "We have to tell the story because soon the survivors will be dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">So the kids who go through the March of the Living say that, “We have to tell the story; therefore, we're going through the March of the Living -- the Holocaust survivors will be dead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">I don't want to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">I want to live for a while yet and tell my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">And I think maybe I will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">With God's help, I will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">Well, the ‘““Shema’” I've been saying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , at the roll call, appell, I still say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">If things get really tough and you know they have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">I've complained already in the meantime and I've had all kinds of diseases, I'll say my “Shema,” I go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">So, basically, I wouldn't call myself a very orthodox person, but I would call myself an observer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">And I think everybody should, in their own religion, should be observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">It will make for a better world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1967">QUESTION:  So you do believe in God?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1968">ANSWER:  I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">Because I, I feel somehow, somebody looked out over me, looked out for me because not too many people came out of this horror.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1970">QUESTION:  When you think about the human race, as opposed to God, given what you went through and what you saw people doing to other human beings, are you -- you don't look like a pessimistic person, but are you pessimistic or are you optimistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1971">ANSWER:  Well, what they did to other people, yeah -- that in the beginning did destroy my whole outlook on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">That I have to admit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">That was, “Where was God, you know, and why did they do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">The Germans educated people, and, you know, why would they do a thing like that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">It is very much so threw me off everything 1n the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">But then I noticed that without God and without a belief, it's not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">I can't go on like that, so I went right back to where I started out from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">I tried to instill it into my kids, but they are not as observant as I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">But, to each his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">I don't preach to them, I let them do whatever they want to because it has to come from you <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , so...
QUESTION:  Is there anything you would like to say that we haven't talked about, or tell your grandkids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1982">ANSWER:  Well, one thing I hope and pray that there is never a repetition of this horrible crime the Germans have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">I hope that they have a better life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">It doesn't just go for my grandchildren, it goes for all human beings, humankind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">And these wars, unfortunately, in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> and all that, I hope will come to peace, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">That the whole world will be at ease, there will be fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">No guns, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">Guns should be completely destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">There shouldn't be any of this, and people should live in harmony and peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">And I hope my grandchildren -- I won't see it anymore, but maybe my grandchildren will.</span></p>
