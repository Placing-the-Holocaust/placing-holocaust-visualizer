<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  When did you get married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  In uh '41, November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  What was it like for your then, in '41 1n November in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and you're married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  So it was quite a...for a short time it was...we was very happy young couple but it was a very short time because in '41...1t was...was, it was more and more difficult to be free from the from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , and my husband was again this way because he decided not to go in uh till '40...'41...'42...1t was not so difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">A little perfection (ph) here, a little money there...something...1t was...several...I was not involved in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Only I know that he is not at five to go like a cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He was a very indi...individual person. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But '42...yeah...my son born '42...and uh in '42 began the...life began to be more serious and more pressed and uh my my husband begun to make ___ the possibility through physicians to get some false uh uh paper that he is ill in this illness or other illness, not to go in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to play this way, and he made some ___ operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess and uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to find a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to speak with this physician or professor to pay something, give a longer time for for this illness to__, but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military service so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their ID when he he can go in a in a <span class="BUILDING">mental hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Then the military uh military uh police cannot take out these people from there, and we paid for somebody a very big amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It was...I can't remember...ten thousand penge what made ten months , but you know I will not find out that the professor who was the the head from his <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , he was in this , but my husband went in in this uh uh <span class="BUILDING">mental hospital</span> and to make a little shorter the story, he was able to spend there six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">That was a big, big time in in the very very dangerous time. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I was every day there from forenoon till evening and what was quite difficult for me that the the physician...he was the respon...responsible for this for this uh part from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ...he never asked my husband, yeah my husband decided we didn't know what what this means to be mentally ill, because we'd never read, never learned it was so imm...immediately and my husband thought I decide not to speak with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I will speak only with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And and not with the physician and not others, but I didn't know that this is good or not good, so almost every afternoon, evening when I wanted to left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the physician asked me what I have seen, what was the behavior from my husband and almost day after day I was pressed to find out something but give a picture that he is really not normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He was living...he had he had a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he was speaking, everything, even playing a little cards, but this was not the way to to be mentally ill, so always I find out something that I wanted, that he was very depressed and I thought to play a little cards would be...but he was confused and he didn't find the the way how to play, and each time I have had the feeling I was always (laughter)...but I was forced to make always these everyday stories that my husband really could be hold uh so with this way I think it finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He got the papers that he 1s uh mentally ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This was official. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There was a a from the state or uh supervisor, a professor to make some questions and everything and temporary he he was uh put in...what 1s to to say...I was the responsible for him, you you know this these...and because he had had severaluh __ or <span class="BUILDING">real estate places</span> , this was written in the register book that he is he is not right to sign this uh contract or something I am responsible uh temporary, temporary. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was not for another time when the when the professor or somebody will say that he is OK, he is healthy, so this was a very difficult time but on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> it was very difficult every day to go there and to play this play, but on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> he was safe in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It was...and several times I have seen that was coming military police to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He was not alone in this in this <span class="BUILDING">mental hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There was about...later we find out...always about eight, ten, twelve Jewish young people but nobody knows that the other other is playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That was absolute disgrace and uh when I when I have seen from above that here is a guard from the military police, then I went down down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There was a public telephone like I want to speak to somebody and I was able always to speak with the people, and I take out from the officers...and what is what is the name...who are you looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I wanted to be prepared but it was quite good in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it was quite good as long...my my husband came out I think in the...'43...'43 autumn. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And it was...yeah...yeah...yeah...then we leaved our quite private life in our <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , but very very often somebody...what is this...somebody's saying against against another person...yeah...yeah...why he is at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , why he 1s not in the military...in the labor service, and it was...we decided, my husband decided that we will take a a second <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , to rent a second <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> uh place far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> near near a famous <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> that is a summer place but it was autumn and we did take a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> there with with our little boy and uh later lived there only to visit

</span><span class="sentence" id="143">Naturally our our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it was not in this uh because it was a very unelegant place, a very representative <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They made this into...many of the <span class="DLF">back streets</span> and mainly the most, most people was Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So not far from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was...the corner from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...the corner was avery famous uhuh __ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , 60. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">This was a... cannot now remember that before the Nilos which part owned this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Really I cannot now envision, but this was a famous <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Nex...uh next from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="DLF">back street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who in this list that this will be a yellow-stared signed <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I was not...uh we was not running to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We was a little bit para...paralyzed the first time, but uh somebody was ringing and coming and yelling, so and he began to say that I have flattened this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> what will be signed for the Jews and I have heard the conceriege that here is a Jewish family maybe that we can change the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was quite apathetic in this because this was sure that this is not to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It is only a temporary thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">What will happen with us if it is not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were living, and I went this young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I went in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He showed me which uh...attached there is two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span> and came out a person from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a young man, good looking young man and he asked me uh madame, will you come in in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I thought I don't want to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I must come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He thought come in...there was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I have here a <span class="BUILDING">war factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh I am making uh I am making uh noodle and uh macaroni for the military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Here the <span class="DLF">door</span> will always will be opened and I have a telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And this was not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was not interested in what is this <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I come back and I told Lotzie (ph)...Lotzie is my husband...I find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The main thing there is a particular person. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He told me that the <span class="DLF">door</span> will be always open and there is a telephone, and this was very very important and we decided to change the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We left this our <span class="BUILDING">flat</span> with a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and something that was necessary to this <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> and we made a friendship with this uh factory owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He he immediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh <span class="BUILDING">war factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That was a...that gives a big difference because...uh I cannot remember what was the order that Jewish people from the from the signed <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> can go out between eleven or...till one...something like this, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military, military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and this was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So it was quite a, quite a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was written...I was I uh a person always I was looking the good side. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Now we are in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is took in uh my husband's uh brother, a physician with a wife and two little children and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span> there was a help for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She was my cooks and she was looking always after my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was living eight, nine, nine or ten person in this two-room flat, but there was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">In uh during this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I am not a historian to to...and we had heard that the...in the...what happened in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> everywhere and what was the meaning ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That I think there was together and what the meaning deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Not exactly...only about. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We didn't get any any detail how was this deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Always I I was looking what is deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">To take the people another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Maybe uncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But we have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">In the meantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I have heard sometimes from my husband that he is a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It's his business, and he went always out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...a lot of telephones and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very interested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued this deportation from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn because this deportation, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> together...put together the people and put in because it came very very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , till the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it was a a feeling that tomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then uh I think it may be August...we get some some information that what is stopped uh_———_—sw you know, ...uh stopped the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh what will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change the government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced that what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately danger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I didn't run to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going to . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I told you are crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">You are speaking something what is believable. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">When when people must hear...why not in the press, why not make these organization and to take children, old people, and my husband told yes, this 1s the sign and when the people is taken for the work, why the children, why the old people, why the the ill people, why everybody? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">These people will bring the and I thought it is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Don't speak in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I wanted not to hear it this way, but...so we get a little breathe, a little better feeling and even we began to very optimist, very...that the war must be finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard what is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and we knows that the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and really I know I cannot uh mention what was the front situation, but it was a possibility to think that we had a little uh a little uh future, maybe that we will be the only person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the only Jews to survive this with our , without without to take to deport...to be to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">That or dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So it was a quite a good feeling till 16th of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">This was a...Jf I can good remember a Sunday, a nice autumn Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We went out, my husband and I, a little bit strolling on the on the Buda, to get a little fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We uh carved out <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and this was a very nice forenoon only it was interesting to see that a lot of military uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> went out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , German military uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The direction was out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We have seen this and it was very quiet in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we came back to this yellow-starred <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and something was in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">It was not announced anything, but everybody had had a feeling this 1s a strange interesting day. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Something will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In the same day so in the noontime uh not in the our, with whom we changed the the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , he came in and he told you know Mr. Szamosi when something will change, we will change back the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We had nothing again...uh against each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">You are you are agreed that I didn't made anything against you, and my husband thought OK, OK, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It was so in the <span class="DLF">air</span> even the Christian people had had a feeling something good happened in the very very next future. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">After noon we have heard the declara...uh declaration from ___ that he finished the the the partnership with uh with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was to hear it was something that we finished from our <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but in the same time we was with each other, and my husband thought interesting that they are making such a big change. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Where is the Hungarian army? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">How can, how can we change something for such a drastic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We was coming through the —__ on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> what was always uh uh guarded from the Hungarian and from the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">There was always guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">When we came back there was no guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There was no Hungarian and no no German. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was just so...if somebody's thinking about the the _, it must be something. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We hadn't hadn't seen any Hungarian uh soldiers during our our stroll, but it was a fantastic uh several minutes to hear this, but in our our heart it was not the feeling . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">After a...1t was...as we we had heard this declaration twice in the radio or three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Then the radio began to give German march music, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">There was no Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Then after the music...always very, very military uh music...we had heard voices, a message for uh Nilos uh leader people. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There I will never forget the name that and there was a voice, please come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">please come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">A very uh prominent Nilos. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Then I had un we understand that here happened something, what was in a good way but came out in the opposite way. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And uh then in the same evening we have heard thatuh | that the declaration for is void and the new govern...government 1s the Nilos government. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The leader is and several other very uh fraidful (ph) for names, anti- Semitic persons, Nilos leaders.</span></p>

class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Nobody went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We was waiting what will happen with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Mainly because our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was the very first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Nilos Nilos government take these sixty, this became the headquarter and we was the very first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="DLF">back street</span> for this corner <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we had the feeling that when they are making something, then we are the first in that <span class="REGION">area</span> ...the yellow-star. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Everybody was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We was...like a guard closed the the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We was looking out in the night,

<span class="BUILDING">house</span> , only a feeling something to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We have seen people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , groups, guarded with Nilos uh people with a with a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I think it was...they went on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with hand up, mainly men in the direction to the corner <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , this headquarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Nobody knows why, which kind of people, Jewish people, so this was the first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Nobody was sleeping and nobody knows what, what will be the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There was order that the...after the | declaration, a lot of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ...the people went to take down the sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Naturally their first order was to put, to return the sign, the yellow...the yellow star was quite a big star, about almost a meter big on the on the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and the cur...curfew... what is the...and the naturally we...that that the Jewish people not allowed to go out from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There was every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was a conceriege or somebody who was responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a list with a with a...tenants...how many people is there, who is there, and this was the order that nobody can leave the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Uh my husband began to speak about leaving...we must run out from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">This was not a question to go out, because the conceriege was sympathetic and that was this...a good friend is <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owner and he was able, every every time to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and to to make something. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">This was not a question of where. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Where. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And this was the first time that my husband took in his pocket our uh second identification what he bought...he bought in the very beginning when when the German army came to to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He had had a imagination that uh he will be able to disappear when we are when we are taking other identification for the family like Christian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">When I have heard about this and he bought... cannot remember what was the connection, how he bought this from a Christian family...uh the father and the mother about the same age like my husband and I with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Accidentally the name from the children was Peter and I think my daughter was Mariam... _. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It was not very far, about the same age and in those time my husband paid paid a nice sum from this but I wanted what to took in my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It was something what normal person cannot imagine how I carried with that name and other identification and I thought I will not see these. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">You must put this someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I cannot take inthe hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">IfI__ different name and they _ different person and this was the time when my husband took this false identification and he put in his pocket and he told he must walk go out from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I thought no where. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I don't know where.

</span><span class="sentence" id="415">We will see what will be tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And this was our our way back to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">In the meantime the population, there were people from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not happened anything and we went to sleep and the next day to go through in this drama...my husband, early morning he went out but earlier there was a round-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> two Nilos with a gun came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Every man down to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> till sixty year old with some one day food. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They are going to digging uh <span class="DLF">traps</span> for against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , __ in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">My husband went and didn't went uh didn't go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It was...he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He was not in this age to be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like a Jewish person. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I went out and I went uh I told my husband cannot go, and the Nilos asked why. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I told he's he's very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">What is his illness? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I told I told he is mentally ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They told OK, remain at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So later my husband went out and arranged with the Zionist organization that beginning from this story and other story that uh they are making several <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> and my husband came back and told me and earlier whenever I have heard about Zionist organization or something only I have heard that uh in the summer time that when will go a group out from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , we are in this list. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">This was the whole what I had heard earlier I forget about 1t. Then my husband came back and he told that there will be a uh <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> for is exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We are...we get the permission to go in with the children and we can work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And this was in the ...1t was a very Jewish surrounding but it was out from the <span class="REGION">ghetto area</span> , so we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There was about forty-six uh children, almost the same number adult people like uh like workers is...they are working with the children and the first evening and I take something from myself and I take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> because this was my like sin my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">If I have heard about to work something, it was always in my mind connected with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">If I am working, I am working with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> because I was not able to make any other work, so I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and it was sitting there in an <span class="INT_SPACE">office room</span> like half from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Zionist people, my husband was uh knows several people from this...I, first time I have seen these people and uh there was some very peaceful uh discussion about uh when we are taking in in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the children, which way we will educate the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Uh it was a quite a a leftist uh influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I think it was absolute curious for me that while —_—_—s Zionist Jews, Jews...what is the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">What can be different they leftist or...we will...1 was absolute out from these ____ and my husband was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">He was very tight-lipped, tight-lipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">He was not speaking one word. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I have seen on the face that something he was not satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Later I learned that this was not the thing what was so interesting to speak about the education, how they are educating the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So the second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh some kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> ...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> uh platform (ph), two wheel and somebody was personally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this <span class="BUILDING">war factory</span> and uh some some uh margarine, some very important cleaning things, again supplies, games...several very practical things, and he put these in and it was a little bit interesting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying convert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have right to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in this in this chil...<span class="BUILDING">children home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So in a very short time my husband took in his hand to, how to fill up with children these not to be very care...very careful how many children we can give <span class="NPIP">place</span> or what or which kind of children over. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">With this, in this time <span class="NPIP">outside</span> from this <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> , becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people didn't...certain <span class="REGION">area</span> what will what will be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was already opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">The very old people must go in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The people till uh sixty must go ina certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> like a horse racing uh <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Women in another <span class="REGION">area</span> and there was a ina block out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Uh children above sixteen must go with the with the adult people. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Below this remain in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">A woman, women with uh with less than one years old baby can remain with the baby in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So it uh produced a lot of children without parents in these yellow-starred <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Their mother went in this way, the father there and there was the concierge to be responsible that all these people went, left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and not remained or hidden in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So that began to...that meant a lot of children from one, one and a half year till fifteen, fourteen, fifteen and on without without parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">This was the __ first to make this <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> , to bring in these children in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this action made by Otto Komo (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Have you heard about Otto Komo. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He was the president of the Zionist uh Hungarian Zionist uh organization and he was a leader who get the leadership to to save the children and the the how to say umbrella was the uh International Red Cross to give a section and above this was the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">From the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Embassy</span> the the help gave with their . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Later we learned that he was an absolute perfect savior during all the time, without any uh bit of _____ or or something, but this is another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I cannot go...yeah...so my, our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> became this <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The two children was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...I don't...I I cannot remember exactly because my husband took in almost immediately his brother's wife with two little children and my my sister-in-law, she told you can be occupied in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I will occupied with the children, your children together with mine, and I was occupied in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I wanted immediately to make lists about the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">There was children and I told who knows who is these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Must take out if somebody is in the age to tell the name is OK or an other from the neighbor knows that this is this younger child, what is the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was such a person to make some organization, some order, and I began to make some lists who is the children, what is the name, which <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they was coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">If somebody will ask or might be a person, if a person, not a , SO this began to be my occupation and my husband went mainly out and he goes...he went in the headquarter from this International Red Cross organization, the children from the <span class="BUILDING">headquarter</span> was in the or _. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">This was a very famous uh headquarter for the Zionist organization and this was the source later for the shutzpasses (ph) and the several <span class="NPIP">places</span> including uh uh storage where was where was food for the <span class="BUILDING">children homes</span> and everything and my husband began began to work at on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He was not able to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">From <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and to get frequent information to put that information to to look always a little bit farther what to what to what is necessary to made, what and this...he went to see other <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> that there is the food and everything is going OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">He was not nominated for this, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">He made this because he has had a feeling that somebody not make this the practically way, and uh so he become to be aa living, moving connection between the several uh several uh I say <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ...uh <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> or <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and these <span class="BUILDING">children homes</span> get permission to remain for a certain time outside from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and what Komo take is who was the person who was looking after the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  Tell us exactly...
ANSWER:  So, they began to give uh shutzpass my husband, and other people...there was several Jewish people uh sheltered in the in the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They began to make shutzpass with uh photograph, almost the same text like the like the Swiss shutzpass, only it was more interesting with the with the with the photos, that people is uh getting to get a Spanish citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The people...first we give the next uh family friends when he knows where is this and we was not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">My husband make a a list uh the families from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where where what we lived before we went in the <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> near the near the headquarter from the Nilos. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">There he get the whole list. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I ] mentioned that every uh signed...uh I become to be uh tired...uh every <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> with the with the yellow star, there was a list from the name exactly who is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">My hus...my husband get from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the com...complete list and he made for everybody a shutzpass and naturally not every every <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span> was with photo. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Only when we find the people, when we find the people then my my husband will give me the photo from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">He went in the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> , made the the <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span> , and gave back to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And nobody knows why. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Nobody knows why they get these, because we was...first of all there was not the _____ was that people who is connected or people who have relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and this was more uh far to connected with <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> ...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> like uh <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , not a lot of relatives from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , was in in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So the people who get this uh the Spanish uh uh shutzpass, it was quite an exclusive and and elegant shutzpass, much more respectable than the Swiss because from the the Swiss began to be very much, and the Nilos began to uh re...realize that uh it is too much and it cannot be and cannot be uh respectable and uh they began to turn these and go out when they made a roundup, not to accept the...not everywhere but they began to...these these uh tendencies, . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">With the most the more respectable was this the <span class="DLF">Wallenberg shutzpass</span> , the Swedish, but beginning the most was the the Spanish, and that was a a argument what uh Dr. Farkash used, may maybe some breathe that we are the the...<span class="NPIP">someplace</span> was very flexible and it was not a very difficult thing to to make an influence to help to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">He was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">He was not a hard bureaucrat or far not an anti- anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So the most res..respectable was the Spanish, because there was an an argument that the Spanish government, the only government he accepted the Nilos government. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">The very simple people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> didn't understand what is accepted and not accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">This was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Gives gives a . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The low end was the Swiss uh Swiss uh shutzpass. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The next was the Swede and the highest was the was the Spanish shutzpass. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It was not a big amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">It began to be more...yeah...it was a certain amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Naturally when somebody was sheltered, Jews or even Christian there in the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> , and he had heard that I had a a neighbor or a friend from my neighbor or somebody use it a <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span> , there was even, but never was uh there a <span class="DLF">line</span> to to stand before the before the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> like before...before the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Embassy</span> there was every day tumult, uh violent people to go in and to ask and to get these uh shutzpass. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Almost the same thing but less was before the uh before the <span class="BUILDING">Swede Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Here before the Spanish, there was never a <span class="DLF">line</span> because the people don't know what is what is the way to get this. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They...if somebody get it, it...they get, not asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Mainly maybe that there was several people to ask Farkash or some breathe or I don't know...maybe by luck or can you can you get me, can you get a shutzpass. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">It was always valu...valuable for for people who was who was asking, but not from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a <span class="DLF">line</span> and violent uh tumultuous uh scenes. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">This went very very discreet. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">My husband, when he went out and to give for the for for the people the <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span> , never told that I am Szamosi or who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">First of all because in the ____ there's another uh other date because he was...I must here a little bit make order...he was...my husband was in the background and and the key position was for Farkash . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">My husband asked something from Farkash __ and Farkash made this, made the influence to get this from someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And this was such a shadow work. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It went for a certain time when it was a little bit more and more valuable this uh <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span> and they made <span class="BUILDING">Spanish houses</span> for the for the protected uh people, and it was almost the same <span class="REGION">area</span> ...not always. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">It was it was far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but this was a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> uh in quiet a little circle, and this was became the name the protected ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">There was Swiss, uh Swedish and and uh and Spanish uh protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">People went in in these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">My husband wanted to work more effective and there was there was a lot of handicap in the meantime that they already wanted to bring in the children home in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And to go in to the police uh headquarter to speak in the in this to to get another term, to hold out the children from not to to put in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And so speak with these people and my husband was without any identification, only that he is a worker to the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">There was not written that these Jews or not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It was aa certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I get these two who who was working with the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was a little uh uh like a booklet, hard uh cover and quite __ <span class="NPIP">inside</span> with the with the picture that this person is help, a worker in the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">This was an old identification but he hold but he had had a feeling that this 1s not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He can be choosed with this be...like Komo Otto was a head worker for in the International Red Cross and not and everybody knows that he is a Jew and uh he wanted to get some nomination from this uh <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> that he is working in the frame from the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Uh this was not an easy thing but immediately my husband wanted to put in Otto Komo (ph) to this position, because he had had an imagination that Otto Komo in a very big danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">He said there's known Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He he was working always against the the the the wave to save the Jews, and he was a very prominent person and he was Jewish and all his uh identification like a Jewish leader person. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And my husband had had an imagination that he, Komo Otto is in a very big danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And he was speaking with Komo Otto that uh that come in in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You will be in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in a neutral in a in a <span class="BUILDING">neutral consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He wanted not to get these these uh personal uh exception or something, because he thought I am I am legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I am sitting here in my position legal, absolute legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But it was...he was a little bit , Komo...Komo Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He was a little bit uh look in the future that immediately it will be finished and then I can continue my work and to take the these orphan children and uh poor people to send to to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and to make a a make a new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the Jewish people, but in the meantime there was...the front was closed but to close it was a matter or something, something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Nobody knows how long it is for, and my husband beg...began to worry the very very deeply for Komo Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Then Farkash often spoke with to to prepare these nomination for Szamosi and Komo Otto. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Somebody started OK, I am ready but what is there what 1s their rea...what is their basic. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I must get a letter from ; from the International Red Cross, that he asked me to make this this nomination for these two person. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">It was not a simple uh thing to influence —__ what was much harder, a very...how to say, tough bureaucrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">There was...uh Komo Otto has a lot of fighting with the with uh .Bytheenduh ____ was ready to give this letter, to send this letter to someplace, to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> , and they get a letter I have in my my documentation that the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> nominated uh Szamosi__ and Komo Otto like a a co-worker or officer in the in the frame in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">It was very important for my husband because while...have you some question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  Explain what you mean by nominating him as an officer in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  (Cough) When here you don't know this when somebody was...an an inside worker in a in a <span class="BUILDING">neutral consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">These people was uh accepted for for any uh <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">They was free to go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and and to arrange things. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">This I have forgetted that this this was a madea____ to go in in several <span class="BUILDING">office</span> uh <span class="BUILDING">police office</span> or ministertum (ph) or something to speak in the in the interest for the Jewish people, so they get this uh identi...identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Komo was not ready to use this. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Still he he saw that he will take uh several several <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the Ritz (ph) Hotel. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">This was not bombarded, that there will be the... immediately after the war there will be the officers to organize the groups and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And my husband everyday told me but hear this, these several days, what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So this was this was always an like a mania in in the mind for my husband and this and this person is in danger, personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So when they when they get this nomination...this was in mid-...I think after one day, two day the left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And this was a very nice day because there was . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">He get a breathe that I have no more boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I must look influential and ask and to and to make the whole the whole ceremony to get something, almost and once more I am I must uh say that he was not a heavy person, ...helped, he was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Uh but it was a very nice uh situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">We are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">The <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The stamps, the papers, everything is here what we what we need, and we...and we are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">We can make what we want without control. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But uh Farkash —_ was a law...a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">A person he was not a partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">He was responsible to to make something in the Legion forum as it was OK we were free to make, but if somebody will ask that where is the where is this charge d'affaires, then then we cannot be uh Spanish, I the Hungarian Farkash or you the Hungarian Szamosi. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And uh that was like I told I had heard...now I can hear my husband's voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He told that Farkash happily told me that you know in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there 1s an Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">He will be good like a like a Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Who knows that he is Italian and not Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">The name is quite good...Per...uh Perlasca. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He will be the boss and so Perlasca became the boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">His was the nomination. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">This was...and now I must...if I am not going to wait to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perlasca</span> because it 1s another uh but uh when the first interview about...after the when he get in the , the writer's gentile and every honor...there was a big interview in the Jerusalem Post and I wrote this uh...I was very...at first I was laughing on this on the situation, but I became a little bit bitter but thisisa__ story and I did speak about this, that I was earlier too, so he told in this interview, Perlasca, that the first day I awake...I awake a nice day that uh somebody's left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The first day I didn't know what to make, but later I came in like a fish in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , so that means that the first day he didn't know what to make but it was not uh very much to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">My husband was very happy to get somebody who give him a a to to help his uh appearance, and there remains the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diplomatic car</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">My husband was a chauffeur what in those times was not every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Not every people was a chauffeur because in those time was very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and very few uh gentlemen chauffeur, but he was always work uh working with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he was a chauffeur, and he was happily he took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and put near by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perlasca</span> and he went there every day too to look after uh <span class="BUILDING">children homes</span> and what need and what and which paper, who needs some shutzpass, what is the name, uh where is this people, and it was a big help with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to make this and not on foot, but earlier he made on almost every day by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And he put that Perlasca that too I have a big help because he was able when when that he went in in a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> that I am here with this Spanish uh charge d'affaires and he was able to speak, because earlier once he was uh uh making a very difficult uh agreement with a police, in a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> for a <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> what was surrounded to put in in the in the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...my husband was alone to speak with this person that here I have a paper from a higher officer that this <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> can remain in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> till 24 in December and this happened uh one week or ten days earlier, and this was a uh this uh uh argument between my husband and police uh chief there, and this was the only uh day when the police chief asked who are you. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And then he take the paper from the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> that Iam an employee, employed in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> , and to this appearance it was a big help that he was able immediately to say that I am here with the Spanish charge d'affaires in this thing to arrange to arrange to look after somebody who was disappeared from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , maybe that he is here in this <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And he went every <span class="NPIP">where</span> in the in the <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> and the...and to look the the the protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for a certain time with Perlasca, but for a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Later Perlasca was not very much interested to to go out because the the whole situation was more and more dangerous plus the bom..bombs because it was more and more closer the front and every day, almost every every hour was uh non-stop bom...bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So he was not uh...he left out slowly slowly from these these activity to see the and to take uh food or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">It was not his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">My my husband knows where is the storage from the International Red Cross, where is the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The food was mainly some margarine, some mainly milk powder but was like stones what was necessary first to to make a powder from this, some uh uh very simple uh medicine and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The bread was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Naturally it was not in a very hugh amount but uh they made a agreement with a bak...a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> who was ready I think hundred or some amount of bread to make every every day for the International Red Cross for the uh what my husband parted with the Spanish uh uh protected people to...because these people wanted to get a good paper when will change the regime that they was helpful for for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So it was a...to to be protect, to be protected when the change will come, so there was a...[ don't remember...I think in the but it is today not interesting that it in the memoir that where was the storage and and where and this uh <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> where where my husband was able uh to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Later...this was the only <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> ...uh to get some some bread and my husband took into <span class="BUILDING">Spanish consulate</span> because there was the storage for food not very very uh luxury food but to to survive but the bread was an every day ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So...yeah...
QUESTION:  Let's pause a minute because I want to be...I know there's a disagreement about Perlasca and I just wanted to be clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Uh you feel that your husband initiated everything and did everything and Perlasca was only along...
ANSWER:  He was a...he gave us support. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He gave us support for my husband because he was sitting there and he gaved for my husband appearance that some more and more and more stress that I am here with somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Later he was not ready to came out then uh what was often brought in in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , not . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Somebody was asked for for Farkash to to bring in in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> several gendarme. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">You know what is gendarme people? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">These was the most brutal police people from from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">These people was not working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but the most most brutal persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And uh it was a little bit uh not uh comfortable for my husband and there was several Jewish uh Jewish person but it...now I get the picture but that in the in the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> there was another section for the Christian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Refugees, Christian refugees like Perlasca, Italian and I don't know who others, but this was separated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  Did you know about this at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  In those time I did not know about this, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  We need, for this interview, we need to talk about only what you knew at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Not what...
ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">In those time I didn't know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Only I I I know that that Farkash all time was always very very careful what he is making not to make a big uh a big advertisement that we are giving uh even after when somebody's left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">He was always always very careful not to make a big a big advertisement we are giving out shutzpasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">This was a very secret, very very very uh bad action. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I had heard from my husband about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perlasca</span> when when they was very happy to...he was very happy that I have somebody to go out and then from the residents, from the every day residents, slowly slowly went out the name from Perlasca. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">It was not a...my husband began to be more more uh he get more uh more...he get in more in this in his actions and he went alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">He was not alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Never he was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He was putting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> uh somebody to take from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> from another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or a Jewish person from the from the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> to bring to another to the where 1s...to the uh uh headquarter to the , or to give several lift to give for several people and when when uh Perlasca was not ready to co...to came out, then my husband influenced these these uh man from this gendarme to sit near near by, near my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">This was a very picture that somebody is going with a gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">This was not . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">This went in this way, so my...one day my husband came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a big bandage on the on the head that he went out from the...every every uh late evening, early afternoon, my husband came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> limping...there is not connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I with the children left the <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> in a certain time and sit in the middle of in the middle of November or late November because the tendency began to be that this there was the paper that all child...children home must be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> uh 24th December. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Then it was a tendency to make less people to remain in the <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> , and uh my husband began to inform the people who is able to go in to this...well to find some hidden <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...go out from this because this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> is no more safe, no more than 24th December. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They must put in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And a lot of people who was in the meantime...as I am speaking this story...there was some periods about I I think this is written in the memoir because I neverImadeaa show many people, children is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Hundreds and hundreds children and more adult people who jammed jammed out from the __ and ran back, escaped some individual way and was coming in the in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to get one night shelter to or to find the children or to find the the woman or only to find a <span class="DLF">roof</span> for a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And my husband began to say to these people it is not a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">If somebody has to have the possibility to disappear, then when not with uh Christian paper then there then in the protected <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with shutzpasses, uh Swiss or Spanish shutzpasses and only the volunteer people can can remain here with the children who is mainly every woman who has no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and not want to be in the pro...protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">This minimum people will remain here and we will see what will happen after 24th Nove...uh November and in the same time my husband finds some some somebody who finds for us a empty <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> in an earlier Jew's uh family and we became a...we became to live with this uh this second identification what my husband bought in the very beginning and I wanted not to see that I will live with another name, another identification, but this was the time when this was the only way and we went in in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in uh near to the to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> like a Nilos family, this Christian name and and we get this <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We was living there for a quite a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I don't know exactly the date...1t was Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">On Christmas Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">He 1s so much lying, so much happening in this very short time that almost I am not able...my husband always ask asked me to write down during the all life time I was not ready to write all this, because I rather not to go in in my head and heart to to live through this period, and I am not a writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I am only a typist, so this was 20 20th in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">In the in the meantime every...this <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for children children's homes...the people began to be less and less because this was clear that this is not a solution for the to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">All these <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> and and <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and this must must go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> will be closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is already crowded, terrible uh terrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">A lot of...very few uh uh food. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">To give, to help to to supply these the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was Komo Otto's work and several people who was helping for him and the remains the the <span class="BUILDING">children children home</span> only with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The little children because when somebody was fourteen, fifteen years old, these children was able to find some hidden <span class="NPIP">place</span> alone, and this was an interesting period. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">My husband get a...I think I never write on and I cannot remember which <span class="BUILDING">cloister</span> (ph) was this that my husband went in and asked papers, Christian origin papers for girls, certificates, born certificate or parents uh uh marriage certificate to...some certificate to to make a person Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">A born certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">My husband bring these...I can't remember...this was quite a lot of papers and he get these from a from a clo...cloister and began to ask uh younger woman who 1s about this age, who can, who can use these. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">This was born in this age, some similarity some similar age, and this paper was enough to go out and to to be to get a job like a postman was not working, postwoman was not working very much in this but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> ...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tramway</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric tram</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ...this was working and there was to sold the tickets, the women work, and the the new the Nilos regime is very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Woman became the first persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">There was no more more ready to work in this very simple work. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So that was job available, and these Jewish women went to be a conductor on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Get a hat and a something what was absolute perfect the uh identification for a Christian person so this was a a this was a way to to lower the the the population in these very crowded <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">This was a way the individuals disappearing was another way and the and the <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span> , but already all these protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , it was full, full, full with people but it was not a question that people can live under under <span class="DLF">staircase</span> or someplace, only <span class="NPIP">inside</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Ten person in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was not interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">It was sure that this is not for a long time, but it was sure that this is not a life-saving. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It is only a time _. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Never I was able to use this that we saved, we saved lives. </span><span

name. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Nobody was interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Nobody knows about who was Komo, what, what happened. </span><span class="sentence"
