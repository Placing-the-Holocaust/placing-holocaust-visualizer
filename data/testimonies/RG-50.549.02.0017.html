<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  It was a matter of convenience. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It’s too much hassle to go through all the papers and changing names and whatnot, so I decided to officially go by Mischkinsky and whether I was referred to as Mrs. Bermanis or Mischkinsky or Bella, was of no importance or difference to either of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  We -- will you describe something about -- you -- you had said in the first interview, a few things about you childhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and how you were sort of a happy go lucky young girl and -- and you weren’t really a -- a joiner, or a member of groups or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And you mentioned a little bit about your -- your family and their political interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Or -- your father was a Bundist and they weren’t particularly religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I wanted to get more of a sense of your relationships within your family and if you could state your father’s name and your mother’s name and say something -- and -- and your sister’s name and say something about your early relationships as a child before the war, with each of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Well, my mother’s name was Gitla Voidaslavsky -- was her maiden name and she married my father, Natan Berger and she adopted -- adopted his name, so she was Gitla Berger. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My sister 1s my junior. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She was born in 1930, her name is Irene, known at that time as Irene Berger. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My relationship with my parents was -- it wasn’t close, but it wasn’t antagonistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My mother was busy working. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She was a terrible housekeeper, hated housework, loved to be with people, loved to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Also, that was not the common standard at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But she was the happiest when she was among people and when she was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My father had a job, not a very strict one. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He was much more educated than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He liked different things than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I could never find a common bond why they ever got married, except the custom in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time was that -- what do they call? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Thedushetimeshat. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Some family introduces a man, other family introduces a woman and they decided that they would make a couple and they get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">There was no courting, dating, or any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And I imagine that’s why they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I never found them very competitive to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My father pretty much went his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He was a terrific mathematician. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He loved politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He loved <span class="BUILDING">cafés</span> , good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My mother was just devoted to work, work, work. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So I was pretty much left on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I would say that my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home base</span> was rather my grandmother’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , where there was somebody there, than my <span class="BUILDING">parents home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Now, which grandmother was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  My father’s mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  And what was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Hiya. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Hiya Berger. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And my grandfather was a just -- a terrific Hassidic man, but very astute, very educated, very respected and he belonged to the -- I think you could call it sect, of the gedda rabbin -- rabbins -- rabbins -- whatever the name is. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Because the Jews were kind of separated by belonging to different rabbis -- who was next to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But the religious life never interested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I had no special feelings towards God or even religion, except knowing that I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Couldn’t describe what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Probably because I was born to Jewish parents and was surrounded <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the Jewish tradition, but it did not affect me at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Politically my father’s -- he had four brothers, two sisters and I had a slew of cousin and inevitably, every one belonged to a different part of the political organizations at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I was not a joiner, but I was listening, cause I loved to discuss things. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I guess that’s something the Jews had, discuss issues to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So they were talking about Zionism, Bundism and all shades of Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Hammish -- hammish hatiyere and the revers 1n this groups and many other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So I was exposed to it, but not a participant. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I never joined any organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I am just not a joiner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Did you have any Zionist sentiments at all as a result of that, or did you feel completely uninterested in it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  No, I had no Zionist interests at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The concert of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and our homeland, that was not something my mind was preoccupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I was probably more Polish than Jewish, except being Jewish definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I had no interest in the Jewish life at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did your parents have any kind of religion that they -- that they were bringing you and Irene up with, that they were -- you know, that they -- did they -- did they bring you to <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> on high holidays or was the -- it really -- pretty much <span class="BUILDING">secular Jewish household</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No, my parents didn’t -- my grandparents, that are Orthodox, so I observed the Jewish holidays and attitudes towards religion through them, but not through my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My parents never gave me a Jewish education and I never showed any interest 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I do have a sentiment and terrific memories of my grandparents <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , who were real true believers. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So, Friday night was a big holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My grandma got -- put the best chaidel on and the long dress and that hose. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Set up a white tablecloths and candles and holly. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And my grandpa -- father came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shul</span> and took the honored place at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and was -- had all the respect of the children and grandchildren and -- so that 1t was always a feeling of religion in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">On Passover, was a tremendous holiday, joy for us children. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Had to change dishes, you have to burn homitz and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But I really -- I was not a participant, but I was an observant and I had no objection to it, as long as I did not have to do anything about it, but enjoy the atmosphere of my grandparents <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  No, I don’t know of anybody -- my personal friends to turn on me, but they stopped being friends by sheer not being able to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So, it was nothing personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They did not turn away all of a sudden because they found out I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was never a secret to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And some of my friends went to a very, very prestigious <span class="BUILDING">Polish high schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And their contact with the Jews was not tremendous, but it never made any difference to me and I don’t think to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We were never discussing religion or the influence on -- we were just friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Young people finding a lot of things in common.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What was the name of the -- of the woman who you met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , who offered you to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oashmiani</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  The Poles.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  Yes, I did realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I realized how much the Poles hated the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I mean, they’re was always anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But it was blatant, it wasn’t obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I was always accepted by my Polish friends, without giving it a thought, whether they Polish or Jewish or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I was never concentrating on those issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And then, when the Germans came in and I saw that all of a sudden, there is such a difference, it no longer became ble -- it was quite obvious they hated the Jews, for many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">First of all, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was instilling in the Poles -- and that was a Catholic country, the Jews are the killers of Christ. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Well, that’s a unforgiven sin committed by the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They killed Jesus, their most believed in person, so there is no love for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Then there was a certain amount of envy. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Not all Jews were rich, but they were comfortable, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And the ones who weren’t were taken care of by the Jews who were more comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Getting rid of the Jews is a big opened <span class="DLF">field</span> of taking over their possessions, taking over their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I guess the Jews presented the Poles of giving them a feeling of superiority. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And that wasn’t very pleasing to the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I don’t know whether they did or they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I didn’t -- couldn’t judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But the Jews lived pretty much their own life. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They were -- they had their clubs, they had their <span class="BUILDING">cafés</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They had their shows. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They were very intellectual, much more than the Poles were. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I’m not giving statistics, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But the majority of the Poles were just working people, farmers, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So I think the Jews felt a little superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Sort of standed off attitude towards other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They felt they were more righteous, they were more -- but they were separate from the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There was never a togetherness. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They maybe worked hand in hand on <span class="BUILDING">working places</span> , but there was no special bond of relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I never felt it, but then I was a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I wasn’t that intellectual to dwell in those political things going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I know that Peelshinsky, who was a leader of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , hey, I loved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He was like -- we called him our daddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When he died, we stood, saluted the flag, saluted his portrait. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Tears were running down our cheeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But that was a skol -- school attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And I really wasn’t that interested of what happens in the adults minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  So did you really stop thinking of yourself as being a Pole and -- and just think of yourself of being a Jew after the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t stop thinking wh -- of anything of that kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I know that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don’t know, th-there is a difference between being Jewish and being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But I knew that I am being rejected by the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Well, I can understand that you have difficulties with that concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Because, if you read about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and if you read about how the Jews were treated -- to me, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> was a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">How did I meet my husband? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">My husband had a lot of freedom in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He really wa -- he really build that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And he had freedom of movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, how does boy meet girl in those circumstances? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I can’t explain it, but there is a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Young people always will seek out young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So, since I was not working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but I was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he was moving freely in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , he spotted that cute little girl and somehow, some way, we started talking, holding hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Nothing else but. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We still were separate -- I mean, equal or not equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We decided to get married, just not too long before Kaiserwald was liquidated.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  And did that -- you mentioned -- 1n the first interview, you were asked about whether you were involved in resistance and you said that you weren’t, because your concern was more just with survival and -- and in surviving without harming others, as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And -- so that --

<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  What I was trying to get at was that -- that same -- that same feeling 1t sounds like motivated you after the war of just not -- not -- not taking on responsibility in -- for something bigger than -- than what was within your sphere of control, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Does that make sense?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think it’s a matter of responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It was just a matter of believe in all those existing organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And that’s why I -- I guess I never joined any. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But it was never the fear of responsibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And it wasn’t quite selfishness that I have to take care of myself, to protect my life, because there really wasn’t much protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Because your life wasn’t worth much and you had no assurance that if you don’t take care -- if you don’t take apart the resistance, you’re going to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">As a matter of fact, I sensed that the chances of being saved belonging to the resistance was greater than being a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I might be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I don’t know, I never tested it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  Funny guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Well, we were fully aware that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> has a quota system and the largest quota was for the German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The smallest quota -- or one of the small quotas was for the Poles and the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But then, with the Truman’s doctrine of letting people in, we knew that that wasn’t that strict any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They still would let in a certain amount of Jews and the guy they send from hiyas to take care of the immigration, came here before the immigration was opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And he was very well versed in the laws of immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">That’s when he paired off with Hank and he said, “I need some help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So we were elected to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And he wanted to have papers ready when the immigration starts. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And he knew there is going to be just a very short time before the year ends -- I don’t know, just a month or two, whatever, time. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So he worked very hard and he worked us very hard to try to get some documents ready, so when the consul -- and his name was Hoffman -- who came from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , when he opened his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> here, we had stacks of applicants ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But it was hard work, because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">No documents, no paper, no pencils, no photographs, no -- we had to [indecipherable] so we really worked, day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And since we worked for the hiyas, we had access to the PX. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So we were getting cigarettes and that was a value which people respected, not money. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Couldn’t buy anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">But with our cigarettes, we used to get the photographer, we used to get papers, pencils, whatever was needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And we would transport these people back and forth, to have the papers ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So when the immigration opened, hiyas had 90 -- oh, I don’t remember what the percentage, but the largest percen-percentage of refugees were going to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Joint came after them and they -- there were other organizations, but we had it all ready.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Let’s go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I -- I wanted to ask you about how you reali -- when you realized that the war was over and that you were free and how that -- how that knowledge came to you and what your feelings were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  Well, when -- when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , one day an SS woman came to the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg camp</span> and said the Americans are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And all of a sudden, the SS disappeared, the guards disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And the survivors were standing there, realizing that they free. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Well, it’s a very hard concept, after five years, saying, “You free.” </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You free what? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">You free where? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">You free -- we were in a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We never ventured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We didn’t know what to do with ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So the majority went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , without the supervisement of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And they had a ball, they stormed the food supplies, they had a party, they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">My husband and my girlfriend, her boyfriend [indecipherable] said, “I didn’t see the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I am not going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we wandered around a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And the Germans had those <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> or <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> they didn’t live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Because they heard the -- the Germans are going back, we occupied one of those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">We went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and we’re waiting to see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">My girlfriends says the next morning, “I want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Hey, that’s where all the life is.” </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So Bessie and her boyfriend went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and came back within 10 minutes saying that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded during the night, because the Americans did not appear. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And the people were sent out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on a march towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So we stayed there for about two weeks, hidden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , until one day we hear the Germans civilians coming into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and chasing us all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So my husband, who again, had a lot of freedom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> knew some Russian women who were working in polter too. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And they said, “He’s not Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And they pulled him out of the column the Germans surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Well, he wouldn’t go without me, so he pulled me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So I was with him and all of a sudden one of the meisters, for whom I was working, pointed at me, he says, “She works for me, she’s Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So I had to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And he wouldn’t go without me, no matter how much I pleaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So he came back too. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And we were on the march towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and found ourselves on the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elba</span> was the dividing part -- divided the part in two things, so we found ourselves on the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">There was a lot of shooting, all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">It was a miserable night and every time the shooting started, the guards which were sending -- leading us out, made us lie down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and wait until the shooting went over. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">At one point my husband said, “Next time when they tell us to get out, it’s so dark, we stay put.” </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So the column continued, we stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We went in the other direction, we didn’t know where we going. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">We all spoke perving -- perfect German. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">So we did see some German soldiers, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and they were ep -- talking to us in German, just complaining about the weather, the shooting and we answered in German like we one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And we finally found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We were there for about three days, but we always hid in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , just to be sure that we not spotted immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Comfort of life was not our priority. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And then we hear some people coming upstairs and saying. “</span><span class="sentence" id="771">I know there are Jews here. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We going to come and we going to find them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Didn’t occur to them to get down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So we decided it’s time to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So, during the day, early in the morning, we, the four of us left. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We didn’t know where to go, so we saw a name of a <span class="DLF">street</span> , passa -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pashall</span> was the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So we [indecipherable], that’s in the direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pashall</span> , now we know where we going, we going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pashall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So that’s what he did and there were lots of other people who were walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We get to a certain <span class="NPIP">part</span> and all of a sudden we see a German installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But it was too late to turn back without saying, hey, why are they running away -- So we just continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And a guy from that installation approached us and said, “Where are you going?” </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Now, we had a name, so that’s where we are going and he says, “Why you going there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And we says, “Well, we have our <span class="NPIP">place</span> there, we used to work there and we going back to our <span class="NPIP">position</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he says, “Well, I have a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">The Germans left the installation at night and I came over and there is a beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> I like to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But my [indecipherable] broke down. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">If you not in a hurry, if you can help me bring that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I would appreciate it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So we said, “Hey, we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go anyway.” </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So we offered -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  So we went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">He was living in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with his girlfriend and her niece and two little boys and some chickens and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So we stayed with him for awhile, started talking to him and we said to him, “Hey, there are such beautiful things in that installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Why don’t you bring some more to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="794">We help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We don’t mind staying.” </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So, make a long story short, we stayed there for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">In the meantime, his girlfriend’s niece was dating German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So they were coming for a visit at -- in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">So we all socialized.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="821">ANSWER:  So we stayed there for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And one day, the German soldiers who were coming to visit her -- her niece, said that they got orders to march out and they are furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">The <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s abandoning them. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">They are not going to go to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">They want to go to the amies -- which was a term for the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So we had an offer for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We want to go there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">At that point, we all found German uniforms in that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> -- that installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So we all were dressed in German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So we said, “We want to go there, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So we made a date with them for the next day to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">They going to desert their unit, they going to come with us and we all going to go to the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Sounds ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">My husband and the owner of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we stayed with, went for a walk, and they found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It didn’t have oars, but it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So my husband went back, he was very handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">They made <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oars</span> and they were all ready to go to the amies. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So sure enough, next day, we met with the German soldiers, we had a white flag and we all marched to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">As we were doing all that, some civilians come over and he said they use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> a day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">They went over to the Americans, but they were wearing civilian clothes, so the Americans send them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">They were only taking prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So at that point, we had the uniforms, we were seven German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Two women in German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , a white flag and they were all -- the German soldiers had all their guns ready, if the Hitler yugen will stops them, they going to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We got to the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elba</span> , we pushed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> so they couldn’t send us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And now we were waiti -- wait -- waiting for the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It took quite awhile until we saw any patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But finally a patrol comes and stop and search for ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">We didn’t have any and they were taking us to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  What was the work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  Well, they manufactured watchbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">The mo -- the only one in the States of very specialized watchbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">So the girls like me and Bella -- that was her name -- brought a lot of her friends to that and we were sitting and wrapping the watchbands in packages to be shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But then the boss pulled me out of there and he gave me a job in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- as- in a Supervisory job and -- so that was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">My husband had it much tougher. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">He was a civil engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And there was no job for civil engineers in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- for Jewish civil engineers. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He got a job, they were delighted with his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">He build their <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and he’s direct -- the boss said, “I am going to try to get you as a permanent member of our company.” </span><span class="sentence" id="946">But there was a lot of opposition because he was Jewish and he did not get the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So he finally found work as a carpenter in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Was that explicitly stated, that he couldn’t -- that the opposition was because he was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  You mean did he get a letter stating so? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">No, but he was given to understand that unfortunately, there was a lot of opposition on the board, to hire a Jewish civil engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And at that point we didn’t have laws, discrimination and whatnot, so they were free to do as they choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">QUESTION:  Was that shocking to you, that -- that in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> --
ANSWER:  A little bit, yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So anyway, he worked as a carpenter in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And life was pretty hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I was making little money, he was making little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Irene was living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I insisted on sending her to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So that was that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  Did you -- did you meet up with any of your friends at this point from -- from -- during the war, who you’d been with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">We -- you know, they all congregated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we were getting together. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">The problem was that my husband was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">When he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , he already was used to certain recognition and respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">He had that education, he had a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Whereas -- the rest of our friends, who were so much younger, got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> still being very young, with no education, very ambitious. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">My husband was not ambitious. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So he kind of felt, I guess, sorry for himself or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">He did attempt -- he enrolled to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , but dropped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">It was just something he wasn’t used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And he really was not that ambitious to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Life was not unhappy, but it was very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  When did that change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  I’m trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We eventually, from that one room apartment -- and it -- housing was very hard to come by at that time, we got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> through my girlfriend Trudy, who was working in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , we got -- we -- her patient was moving out and we got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astoria</span> and that’s where our son was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And we lived there for one year and then we bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And I figured out, hey, that’s going to be my <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">We stayed there for about maybe a year -- a year and a half and one of the people we knew from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and his cousin came from <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> to visit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">That guy, Mr. Kussman, was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectedy</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And he was a builder. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But he needed someone to build a plan for water supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Well, my husband had that qualification and he said, “I give you a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectedy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">It’s going to be your <span class="DLF">field</span> , but you have to make up your mind.” </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So over the weekend, my husband approached me and he says, “What do you think if we move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectedy</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Well, that was the last thing I wanted to do in my life. “</span><span class="sentence" id="986">What’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectedy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I don’t know a living soul, my friends are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my sister is here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="988">She was already married, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And then I thought it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">He is working as a laborer in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">That gives him an opportunity to go -- get back to his trade, so I said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">So within two weeks he quit his job, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectedy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I stayed with Jeff, trying to sell our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Took about three months and then I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectedy</span> .</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1725">Dillon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">The young man who is taking care of my work in the archives, Dillon is very helpful, very understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">I just love to work -- I almost feel I work for him, because he represents the person I respond to, and he taught me a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">I just love him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">It’s too bad he is so young or too bad I am so old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">But I love that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">And he’s -- I think a -- a big asset to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">But so are other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">I work a half a day at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and it gives me a chance to interact with the public and other volunteers and that’s a great experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> -- or the people I work with are trying to make the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> a very interesting <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the visitors and a very comfortable <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">I think they all obliging, they all courteous and it’s good to see so much people coming -- so many people coming and visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">And what’s also good to see, that they not necessarily Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">So it’s good to see an interest among other people, but just Jews who have the impression that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> 1s just his m- their <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">It isn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">It’s a educational institution for everyone and I hope it’s going to stay that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">I just don’t want the Holocaust to be put together in a bag with any other killings of other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , because the Holocaust was a unique experience, different than the killings and murdering of people which took place in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">It doesn’t mean that it’s -- I advocate it, I am just saying that I feel the Jewish Holocaust was strictly a Jewish issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">What one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , with so much education, was so susceptible to murder of hundreds of thousands of other people, only because they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">They weren’t fighting for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">They didn’t defend anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">They had no weapons to fight back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">They were just led -- the term is the Jews went like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">Well, they were led like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">I do resent the criticisms that Jews did not fight back and they went like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">Well, every survivor fought back, because he is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">And lots of them -- thousands of them who wanted a life, fought back too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">To survive a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> run by the Nazis, the White Russians, by the Latvians, was a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">It was a struggle to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">And I felt a little bit resentful when in the beginning the question was, “Why didn’t you fight?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">Who is asking the question? </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">People who have their dignity? </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">Who are not hungry? </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">Who are not being separated?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1773">ANSWER:  But in my personal life we always talked about it among my friends who were also survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">And strangers or people who became my friends, but were not survivors and did not share my life, I was not going to sit down and talk to them about my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">And if they already were aware of the Holocaust, they had the sensitivity of saying, “We cannot ask her, because it’s too painful.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">So I don’t quite know when it started and how it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">But what I do remember is that I was extremely resentful when I was asked, “Why didn’t you fight back?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">And I said to myself, “Are the remaining Jews embarrassed and ashamed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">They need heroes to say, hey look what we did?”</span></p>
