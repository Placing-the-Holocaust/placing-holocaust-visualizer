<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Peretz--also known as "Perry"--Milbauer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And when were you born, and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , October 1915.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  What were you doing just before the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I had been teaching for about five (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) and been married for about four years to my lovely wife, Blanche.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  What did you do once the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Uh, I just kept on teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had had a summer job (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) as a counselor in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="9">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) and uh I had given this up because I knew the draft was coming, and when I was drafted I went willingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Where...when, where were you sent overseas and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Uh, we went overseas on D + 61 in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">That would be July. (</span><span class="sentence" id="13">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Yeah, July.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Tell me what happened when you went <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  The outfit was (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) first sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to assemble its material. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was a combat engineer battalion that was not attached to any particular outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was attached to many different outfits during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh in my position I rode through <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at a breath-taking pace uh delivering the orders for the materials to be ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The other men from my outfit followed and picked up the uh, not the guns but the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">that we needed for our fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What happend then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Uh eventually (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) we went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> on D + 61. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh we had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> two weeks earlier. (</span><span class="sentence" id="24">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) And we landed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We were attached to the 20th Corps of the 3rd Army--which was [Gen. George S.] Patton's Army, and at that time it was very close to the breakthrough by the 3rd Army forces and we we usually during the war attached to an armored division and they were the ones that moved the fastest. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we rode through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at a break-neck pace until we got to the <span class="REGION">area</span> (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> , where we stayed for about a month, six weeks, before we resumed the onslaught on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  And then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Oh, then uh December 5th, we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And again we followed uh an armored unit through; and the incidents that uh I uh am really here to tell about uh occurred in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And uh it was near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenburg</span> in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We were stationed in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remse</span> : R-E-M-S-E. We had just arrived there that day when uh another GI came over and told me there were three Jews across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They were dressed in the striped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I went over to them, and I started to speak Yiddish to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And, oh, were they happy to be able to talk to someone who spoke Yiddish! </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And they told us some of their stories--uh the same ones that I will tell you about later--and uh we gave them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We gave them some chocolate and other goodies; uh and they told us where they were from, that just down the <span class="DLF">road</span> at the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenburg</span> there were a group of twenty- two hundred freed concentration victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh there were two thousand women-- mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> --approximately, and about two hundred men--mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , some Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They uh were freed just that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were being driven by a group of SS officers to be used as slave labor uh whenever the Germans were able to make a stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They slept in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">When they got up in the morning, the SS officer led the transport to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">If he had led them to the right, nothing would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He would have been able to keep chasing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Where we were, we were following the 4th Armored Division, and uh we were actually a spear-head. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We were heading towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemnitz</span> [NB: Karl-Marx-Stadt], in order to capture it. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And we were sticking out of the main <span class="DLF">lines</span> ; uh but uh after the uh incidents that I'm going to relay, we received orders to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And we went back a hundred and sixty miles uh west and south, out of the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Because that was the <span class="REGION">area</span> that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potsdam</span> Agreement had allotted to the Russians, and the Russians were on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemnitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We uh waited 'til after supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I asked an officer to borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I told the other soldiers in the outfit where I was going with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ; and we got food from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We got food from packages that the soldiers had received overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenburg</span> , uh where these uh freed people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Uh I spoke to them in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">At first, they were skeptical; but then they uh accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I started...we started, rather, to give out the things we had brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And there was such bedlam. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was such fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It became uncontrollable. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We could uh...they were hungry and they wanted these things that they hadn't seen for many many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Oh, finally I, we stopped giving it out and uh it was given to the leader of the group who actually did distribute it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But then I started to talk to the, to refugees who were there, and it it's hard to describe the mixture of happiness and sorrow that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Uh they called us belachim (ph)--angels. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Uh they said the (ph)...the Messiah is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And one man even said, "We're going to have a new Passover--the day that we got rid of the Nazis." </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So that was the happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But the sorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They kept saying, "We are free, but we don't know what freedom means. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We don't know what to do with the freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We don't understand freedom." </span><span class="sentence" id="71">As one man put it, he says...holding the whatever he had received, he said, "I haven't had as much in five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But who can I share it with? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I can't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my wife and say, 'Look what the Americans have given me.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I have no one." </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Besides this mixture of elation and sorrow, I heard the stories that I really already knew about how the Germans had mistreated the uh the Jews that were under their control. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They told me, for example, how babies' heads were smashed against <span class="DLF">walls</span> , the wanton killings that occurred for absolutely no reason at all, just for the sake of killing or for the slightest trivial thing that was done wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh they spoke about working twelve hours at night, after being up all day; and uh stories of that kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh, I asked people to sign a list of names with relatives they might have had in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ; and I told them that I would send the list overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Which I did, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They were reluctant to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They weren't sure that this was an honest list. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They were afraid--some of them, at least--that some kind of deportation list was being made up. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They hadn't overcome the fear that they uh felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And uh I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The next night, I came back again; but the atmosphere was entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Instead of about fifteen GIs being there, there were several hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And they all brought things for the uh women and men that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They were quite safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Uh the day before, there was a lieutenant for the American government--uh the AMG, the American Military Government there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I went over, and I spoke to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I said, "Well, what can you do for these people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He said, "Well, I'll try and get uh the chairman mayor--the Burgermeister--to give them some food, etc." </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And uh he said, "It won't do any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We can't force them, and I'm too busy to really supervise them." </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But when we came the next day, we discovered they had received a hundred pounds of butter--which I figured out to be a tenth of a pound per person approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And uh in addition, the uh rest of the goodies that the uh other GIs had brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were quite uh satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They weren't hungry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Uh, so that that solved that problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I didn't get too many more names, but I did learn a new word the second night. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The word mtissulman. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The man who told me the story told me that a miissulman was someone who was so emaciated, so starved, so shrunken, so skinny that their features became very, very sharp--to the extent that they looked like a mouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And these were the people that were screened out by the Germans for immediate death, because either they couldn't anymore or soon would not be able to do any labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was this man's job to carry the mussulmen who couldn't walk to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And he did that; until he finally too became a miissulman. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But he was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The doctor there uh was a friend of his, and he helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And now the man was pretty husky and pretty strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was not a weakling anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">As a matter of fact, uh most of the people uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenburg</span> were pretty physically fit; because they had been chosen to be the future laborers wherever the Germans would take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So in this case, instead of picking the weaklings, the strong ones were picked so that they could be transported and done some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The list of names that was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were sent to my wife, uh who worked for the <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish scientific institute</span> --YIVO. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The letter arrived on a weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She called up the officials of the YIVO; and they immediately went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , read my letter, read the list of names, and they issued a press release which was published in the Times and the Jewish Daily Forward and the Aufbau. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The Aufbau listed all the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The other two didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And uh the next day, they sat my wife down in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ; and there were many many phone calls from people who were looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We know that she did contact... She looked in the New York phone books and found one or two people who were listed there; and she called them up and she told them that their relatives were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">However, unfortunately, right after that--the next day--uh we were pulled out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And as I mentioned before, we went back and down a hundred and sixty miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I assume 4th Armored was pulled back, too; and the Russians came in and took over the <span class="REGION">area</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenburg</span> and these refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So I had...I had no future information on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The reason we went south was that we were heading towards the so-called Austrian redoubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The story was that the Germans were going to make a last stand in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Austrian mountains</span> ; and American armies were sent there to be sure that nothing even like that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And we went and we moved just as quickly as we had always moved, ending up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vocklabruck</span> : V-O-C-K-L-A-B-R-U-C-K. I hope I got it right. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And uh we were there...we got there on May Sth. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Uh V-E day was May 8th[, 1945]. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Meanwhile, stories started to sift through about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that uh had recently been liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh, again I borrowed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Didn't take food this time, because our Army was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But I took along twenty-three soldiers who wanted to go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The distance was, I...I recall correctly, about uh twenty miles from where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Uh I got permission, a pass, to visit the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was amazed. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">In contrast to the Waldenburg group, all I saw were living skeletons--gaunt people, many of them completely naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Uh many of them, you couldn't tell whether they were walking dead or walking alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Their faces were expressionless. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh, I...I really don't know how to describe it accurately. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It...it...1t was so different than anything I've every seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Uh these...well, "walking skeletons" again, walking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Uh people were lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> --not too many--that seemed to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Uh, I wouldn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And uh here, too, I started to speak to the uh people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh one told me a story of how uh they performed experiments on women, of the kind that uh we perform on dogs and guineas [pigs]. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">For example, the sterilization of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">In a different vein, a...one man asked me, "Are the Jews going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I explained the difficulties that the uh people were having getting into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he says, "Oh, the Germans are such liars! </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We were told that hoards of Jews were arriving safely in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I had looked forward to uh getting there." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">There's also a story that was told of the Germans taking uh Jewish boys and girls, forcing them to get undressed, and forcing them to have sex with each other while they were watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The girls, I was told, were screaming, "Kill me! </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Don't do this to me!" </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But that wouldn't have helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So uh it just went on, the way I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Uh, there were many sick and dying at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The American medics were taking care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh, while I was there, two busloads uh of sick people were transported out of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But there were any number of others who wanted to be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was pitiful to see the bag of bones climbing up the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was a slippery <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> ; they couldn't stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Or climbing on to the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , in order to be there when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They did not get out, because they were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> --hopefully, to go on another load. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ...and there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">This wasn't a big enough <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the bodies were kept before they were burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> --one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> --that could burn eight people every two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">This, I was told, was absolutely not enough; and that thousands of dead Jews and other nationalities were buried in the hillside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The...what I'm touching things, the irony was the sign the Germans had put up on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was a verse, went something like this: "Don't let the worms get my body; better that the fire engulf me, so instead of burying me, burn me. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I'm trying to think if there's anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Uh, before the outfit (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) went overseas, uh every uh outfit had to have an orientation officer to give an explanation as to why we were fighting the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Having been a history teacher before the war started, I was selected to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And among the reasons I gave for our being in...in the war was the inhumanity of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">On the way back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> --and this could be almost two years later--uh I didn't stop to figure it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">One of the men said, "You know, and when I heard you, I thought it was all propaganda." </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I had heard the stories already, because I was interested; and I repeated them to the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And he said, "I thought this was all propaganda." </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And he says, "Now, I know better." </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Went back to uh Vocklabruk; and from there, we were wondering whether we would be sent directly to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , or go for a leave in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and then go fight in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But, fortunately, the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And after spending a lot of time in uh...in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in staging camps, uh I was sent back overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But meanwhile, the rule in the Army was that if you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep, you could get a pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Because the big problem was <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And I happen to have had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">As a matter of fact, uh I bugged the officer so much about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that even at the height of the Battle of the Bulge, when the fighting was going on, they went to get their liquor rations. (</span><span class="sentence" id="191">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) And they came in at seven o'clock in the morning, and said, "Milbauer, you want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I said, "Yes!"
