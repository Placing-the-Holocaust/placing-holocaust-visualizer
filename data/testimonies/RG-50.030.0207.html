<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veenhuizen</span> , I was born January 21,1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Would you tell me about about your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">About your parents...
ANSWER:  My father was Theodorus Schouten. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father was Theodorus Schouten and my mother was Marta Stam. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We first lived in the community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veenhuizen</span> where my father and mother lived when they got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And then what...tell tell us about.....
ANSWER:  Later, later on we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oosterblokken</span> where my grandfather had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Tell us about the <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  I was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The other children already went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oosterblokken</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Wwhat what was the <span class="DLF">farm</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">What was what was your daily life like on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  We worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We played. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We helped my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We helped on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We also helped to milk a few cows.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What happened when...how did your life change? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">when the Nazis invaded Europe (sic), what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  My...there was a lot of change. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My oldest brother was in the service, and he fought on the front, at the <span class="DLF">Grebbeberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was very difficult because when the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> capitulated we didn't know if my brother was alive or dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Every day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there was news of other soldiers who had fought at the front and who had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But we never received any news whether my brother was still alive, and everyone was very sad and worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My father went every day to ask about his son, and every day there was news of this one who had returned, or that one who had returned but no news of the oldest son, and finally my father said I am going to go look for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So then he spent three days searching in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and the war was already six weeks past, six weeks over. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">After......After three days my father found him. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He was not wounded, he was alive, but he was very apathetic and didn't quite know where he was or who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He found him in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And brought him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That's how the beginning of the misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">That's how the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In the beginning it was a little bit difficult but in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> it was fairly peaceful still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  What was it like every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  My brother worked everyday at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and slowly but surely he recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Daily life was fairly quiet and normal at first in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">You didn't notice so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Then they started rounding up people. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">At first they took doctors and and people who had done something wrong in their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My uncle was also a doctor and was picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">At that point, people went on strike here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">In 1942, in the beginning of 1942, they even picked up my father because he had not delivered milk as he was supposed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That was his way of striking. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">At seven in the morning, the Germans came with a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> [used for raids] and all around our <span class="NPIP">place</span> they they were were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And took my father along. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I helped my father get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He was still in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> because he was a little sick and he didn't have (his) papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My mother was walking in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> with the mayor of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because the mayor had come along because he had to point out the people who were striking because the Germans didn't know where they were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was also restraining my brother who was very angry because after all he had been in the war and wanted to attack them. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> helping my father get dressed and getting his things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He didn't want to take his wallet and he didn't want to put his coat on but the Germans said he had to take his coat because it is cold on that open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So then there was a panic because he left without his ID papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And we were afraid if he if he didn't have his ID papers he would never get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Then I biked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I got on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and rode out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where they were picking up other people, with his ID papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I found my father at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German car</span> and gave him his identification papers even though the Germans yelled at me that I was not to go near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I succeeded in giving it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but first I stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and there I burst in to tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And then this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was standing at the <span class="BUILDING">neighbor's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He also had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I thought my goodness, now the neighbor will also be picked up but that wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They were simply asking the neighbors to keep an eye on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">To make sure that nothing would be taken away and that no livestock would be removed and it was the neighbor's responsibility to see to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was a terribly difficult day. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Everyone thought my father would never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , but I don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">01:14: There they took everything away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He didn't have very much with him but what he had they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But later that same evening we got news that he was on his way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But we have no idea why they let him go like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Sometimes we think the Dutch Nazi Party (NSB) put in a good word for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Then he told us that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> they made him read lists of people who had been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">His predecessors...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Can I ask something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  He had to read lists of names of people who had been shot as an example to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But he refused. (</span><span class="sentence" id="80">Laughter) He was very stiff-necked and stubborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He said I cannot read. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So he didn't have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So then he was allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but he had the audacity to say, well, I don't have any money to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He he thought maybe they should bring him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again but he somehow got money and was able to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We were over-joyed that he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> had thought he would never return. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Later on, boys were picked up from the <span class="DLF">street</span> , young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">O1:17: They had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work for the Wehrmacht in some way and they went into hiding, underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That started the period of putting people into hiding and we, from periodically, got one hiding person or another, one fugitive or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">One of them got sick and we brought him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and we never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Later on we had a young man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enkhuizen</span> , that's in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , in our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We also got a teacher from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoorn</span> who was working in the resistance and had to disappear from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He would ask if he could stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">A few months later he asked if his son could stay with us who was at that time in hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaandijk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">For three months he sat in a <span class="INT_SPACE">attic room</span> which he never left. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He went crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">After that he came to stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Sometimes he spent whole days in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Eventually he recovered somewhat and we urged him to get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and to walk <span class="NPIP">outside</span> where other fugitives, were able to walk freely in the <span class="REGION">country side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We put them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They started to help out a little bit, because doing nothing all day long is very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They also walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but they generally stayed close to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and our <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">In the fall of '42, Laura came to us, or maybe it was '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I don't remember the year exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">After the war we didn't talk about it very much anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Laura was brought to us on a Sunday afternoon by two men on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoorn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The two men were from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and asked us if we could take a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Well, we already had several people hiding in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I liked children very much, so we thought there was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for one more. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And then that was Laura. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That was Laura. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She was very sad and cried quite a bit because she had already experienced quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Later on my sister came with her oldest daughter, her little daughter who was a little bit younger than Laura, but we didn't really know how old Laura was until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">01:23: She was a bit younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Quickly they started to play and by evening they were having a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My father said to my sister, why don't you leave Riet here for a while so that the little girl will get used to us and have some to play with......they can play together. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It worked out very well and soon she began to feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">She had experienced so much she was still quite fearful and in the beginning especially at night she often woke up crying and screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">She had it difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I slept in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We always did it that way, and when she laid down, I always had to hold her hand. (</span><span class="sentence" id="122">Laughter) Well, my niece had to leave again because she was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and she played with children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">01:25: Once in a while Riet and Dick were here with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They would come and play. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">For the rest I, we all thought it went very well with Laura. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She was very happy and cheerful afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And we loved her very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And Laura loved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Every week I wrote a card to her parents, so-called, because we really didn't have any idea where her father and mother were. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I had to write it and Laura would dictate. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">No card every came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So it was kind of unnecessary and so the war went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Laura went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was informed they knew it and took care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was fairly safe although there were searches at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but they said it would be OK to send her. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was too difficult to keep a child hidden all day long, completely hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Even in our own family we had several nieces and nephews who who sort of looked like her and even had dark hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Everything ran very nicely and evenly. (</span><span class="sentence" id="139">laughter) She did well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There were not that many difficulties any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Of course once in a while there were Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we would get the news of that and then we would just go on out our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I would visit my......1 would visit my sister or go somewhere else and would take Laura along. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The underground took care of it and saw to it that we got food coupons for Laura and the other people we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">She was of course afraid of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">When she saw a German she would say, he's not going to do anything to me is he? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">One night the Germans were in front of our <span class="DLF">door</span> and that was very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">All in their uniforms with their boots and then all the people who were hiding in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had to lay low. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I had......1 had to crawl through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on my knees to warn the adult young men who were hiding of the danger but Laura said, they're not going to do anything to me are they? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And, but it was hard to hide her. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I said just crawl under the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They won't do anything to you and that's what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I think she was with us about two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But we didn't know if her father and mother were still alive or where they were or if they still lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">When she came to us, she said her name was Laura Cruck (ph), but that was not her name and she didn't want that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She wanted to be called Schouten. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So she was Laura Schouten. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We thought it was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The the war caused many difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">There were more strikes. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Here and there people were picked up and deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">In that same way, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a gentleman was taken and all the Jews he was hiding in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we never saw any of them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> here and there people would be shot and <span class="DLF">farms</span> would be plundered or set on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It got very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But somehow our <span class="DLF">farm</span> stayed safe and many people came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> to ask for milk , food, potatoes and grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">At night there was alway after we had milked, there was always a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of people asking for a liter or two of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We also had to set apart part of our <span class="REGION">land</span> for the Germans and give food, part of our crop such as beans or grain, my father had to give to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We had to grow kidneybeans for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My father sold all the beans himself to people who were happy to have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">For the same price that they would get from the German army or that they would have to pay in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In a few days everything was sold out and as far as the Wehrmacht was concerned the harvest had failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">This was our way of striking or resisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">One night a gentleman came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked if he could sleep over, that he wouldn't need any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">01:36: Most people who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> asked for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Once he was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> he was quite a big man. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Inside of his coat he had a Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He asked if he could sleep in the hayloft. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He said, don't worry, I have my own food. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">When he took his food out of his pocket it was three large carrots and that was his food. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So then we had to cook some food for him so he would have something to eat, but the next morning he took took off and we never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Every day more people would come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> asking if we had anything for them to eat or to get some stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It got more and more difficult, these people who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand carts</span> on barefeet, very very thin and sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They were, they were all...they would return with sick people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Sometimes they were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Once in a while the resistance would shoot somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Once in a while the resistance would shoot somebody, either a German or a Dutch person who had betrayed an other Dutch person, and then there would be terrible retaliation and several people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They would grab a few people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> as prisoners and they would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Leaflets would be thrown from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">One time a nephew was walking in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , in an other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he was met by some Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He had some of these leaflets in his pockets and they took him and we never heard a word of from him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My uncle who also had, was also hiding two young men had his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> raided and he and the two young men were also taken along and taken prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He he spent three months in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and later he was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vught</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Those two people who he was hiding did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My uncle was supposed to be sent on transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> were on strike and so he didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So in the end he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Well, then the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The Germans capitulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But even that same day two boys who were in the resistance in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> were still shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was in an uproar that some, that just at the end two more were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We said to Laura, now your mommy and daddy will come soon, but of course we really didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Actually they were only a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> away from us in a little tiny <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I thought how can they hide people in that little tiny <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">One week after the war, on a Saturday, they came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to see Laura. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We told Laura here comes your mother and father, but Laura didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">She didn't know what she was seeing, that she was seeing her father and mother again. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And she didn't want to have anything to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Which was terribly sad for her father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Of course we were happy because it showed that she had had a good life with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkhout</span> , where they had been hidden that same evening and take Laura with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Laura did not want to come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So I took Laura on the back, on the back of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I went along to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkhout</span> to that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But she stayed very close to me and the minute I took a step she would stay right with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So then I suggested to the father and mother that they should come along with me until Laura had gotten use to them a little bit again. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So that's what they did and we all bicycled back to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the father and mother stayed with us for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It was of course very difficult but it went a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The father wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> as quickly as possible to see what he could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">To look after his <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> and his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He got a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there and so they left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Laura was very homesick in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">She thought everything at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was better and the food more delicious than it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">She had at...with us she had her friends and everyone knew her. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> but in the summer vacation she was allowed to come and stay with us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, she agreed to that and she went along to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and when the big vacation came, she came and stayed with us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">She thought everything at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was better and on her birthday, the 26th of August, her parents came to get her to celebrate her birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But Laura said to her parents, but my my vacation isn't over yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Why don't you just come later. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But the mother said yes, but we'll come for your birthday and we'll celebrate your birthday and then we'll stay a few days and then we'll go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Off they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">After the war my two brothers were getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">One of, one of my brothers was a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He was a divinity student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nijmegen</span> and he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a few days, but there was a railroad strike and he couldn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">This is during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Until the end of the war he was in? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">and he worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">At the end of the war, one of the people we were hiding took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tandem bike</span> with him and took him back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nijmegen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were not running normally yet, and so he could finish his studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I don't know what else I should tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Laura came back to visit you when she 18?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">She came to visit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoogkasperen</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It didn't work too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">She came with a friend, although we did have someone who could translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">She stayed a few hours but then in the evening she went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">At first we had news and messages from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and they asked if I wouldn't like to come along to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> but my mother was sickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Later on after the war, my mother became very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">She had a brain hemorrhage. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And was half paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">She was sick for five more years. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">In 1952 she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">My father, who was always very healthy, also became ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Fourteen days later he died, after my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They were, both of them were 66 years of age.</span></p>
