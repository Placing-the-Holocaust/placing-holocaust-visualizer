<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Thank you so much for — for speaking with us today and look really forward to hearing about your story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Ifits okay, let's start out with a few details: Your name, your parents’ name, date of birth, siblings, any other kind of - and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Manfred Lindenbaum, in — born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which is the Rural — the Rural Valley. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">It was probably one of the most nice little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> you could think of: People got along. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">There was no discrimination against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I knew that from my earliest memories and I know it from what my brother and sister told me because they had so many Christian friends when I was very, very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in '32 after Hitler was elected in a free, democratic election. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And my earliest memories are fairly warm of Christian friends for our family and — I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but my brother and sister did. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The change was so rapid it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father's name was Otto Lindenbaum and he had a small <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We lived above it. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And my mother’s name was Freda Lindenbaum. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I don't have very vivid memories of them, which I'll talk about a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My sister, Ruth, who I think about every day, she was older than me and she was murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and she's -- she's always with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She was probably one of the most popular girls in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> and I found that out later from what people told me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> when I visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And she always had — was surrounded by friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And — and then I remember we had to puta J in the <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We were not well off but we were comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above it. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I didn't mention my brother, Ziegfred, who was two-and-a-half years older than me, when — after the J went in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , our friends, my sister's friends slowly started to disappear until there was none of them and my brother would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a daily basis beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He would get dragged through the thom bushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I remember my mother going to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the teacher saying there's nothing he could do but there was a lot he could have done, but he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The most amazing thing when I think back 1s that nobody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> really stood up and said, "What's gomg on here." </span><span class="sentence" id="23">All this culture and all — and all this lack of prejudice disappeared in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I talk to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> because I used to think it could only happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and now I don't believe that anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I think it could happen anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">One of the headlines in the newspaper which 1s really haunting was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> is endless Judenfrei. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That means that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> is finally free of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And that was in celebration of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that pulled up to the <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> where they took the people out 1n their — the Jews out in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchairs</span> and their gumeys and put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and from thence to their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And this cultured people had looked at the headline and I'm sure that there were many who felt disgust but nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So the thing with Unna is that I went back there about 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My brother, who lived a fantastic life, had - and had all kinds of achievements, as he was dying said two things, "Don't you ever mourn me because look at where I started from and look at how my life was," and he said, "but in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> they're saying that our sister 1s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They even say she has a child." </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And he says, "Maybe you want to go back and just give a quick check." </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So I did go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  And I put her picture in the paper and I met with 20 of her classmates and they all said what — how many — she was the most popular girl around and — but the truth was that they had all turned against her. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I spent six days interviewing people and checking and there was — it was all nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I fast forward 20 years and I told the story to my friend Fred Spiegel, who 1s a survivor who lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> very close — very close to me, and he got angry and he went to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he had them investigate, and the reason was because they had a memorial like the dankstein (ph) and my grandfather's name was not on it or my sister's name was not on it and I — I felt upset about it but I felt upset about it enough that I never wanted to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and not to do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He did go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he made them investigate and they found out that she had died with my parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She had died; she was murdered there, and they put her name on. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And about a year ago with my eight grandchildren and my — my children and their spouses, we went back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was very heartwarming. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was — it kind of put — helped put things to rest in my mind because Ruth 1s always with me, she always will be, especially 1f1 do anything good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  She's there—
QUESTION:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  — encouraging me. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But to me what was really rewarding was to see the pain that the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unna</span> that I met, the minister from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> there which has 2.000 members was 1n tears and I told him, ''You were not alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">How — why are you — why are you feeling the pam?" </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He said, "I wasn't alive, my <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was, and my <span class="BUILDING">church</span> did nothing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I got that kind ofa feeling and I think that we need — we need to learn this lesson that while we are not responsible for the sins of our fathers, we are responsible for making the world - by accepting what they did, that it doesn't happen, as atrocities around the world can continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Ifits all nght with you—

<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">In —1in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I was not permitted to start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was dangerous and my brother, who was eight, nine years old, insisted on going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I think that was his perverse nature and they're not going to stop him, although he did have that option. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But I wasn't given the option. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I remember getting a good beating when I snuck out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to go to an anti-Jewish rally because I wanted to see — I just wanited to see what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And my mother was petrified when she grabbed ahold of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I can still remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And you did go to the rally?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  And what did you see, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I saw people screaming and hollermg with depictions of so-called Jews with long noses and things coming out of their head. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And it was — there I was scared but I wanted to - I wanted to see it and I was not the kind of kid who listened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  IfI wasn't supposed to do something, then that's what I would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">What I do remember is that early on we had a nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I still remember the rabbi's name by the name of Jacobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I remember him trying to teach me, which was an exercise in futility; he wasn't able. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I can — I can remember my father in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> looking at the empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cash register</span> as we were driven into poverty because of the J and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  And there was — we didn't have money and we didnt really have the opportunity to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to leave to. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The world was closed off anyway and — my parents would have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There were — there were others who believed - who had this memory ofa short time before that there was no — really no prejudice and just couldn't believe what was happening, and, you know, who stayed too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But my parents, it wasn't an option. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There were some of our relatives, I found out later, who had money and who went out on tourist visas, but then they were running because they weren't allowed to stay anyplace too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In 1938 I have this memory of the clicking of boots and it was a Nazi official, policeman, I don't know what he was, coming into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and telling my father: You have to immediately report to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> with a small suitcase and you can bring ten marks with you, or some — I don't remember that exact thing, but I remember the small suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my father had us pack and we went over to our one remaining Christian friend and I guess my father talked to him and decide — decided that we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The — there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We — there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">There was no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And if you went down to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> or to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , you couldn'trun away. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So we ended up at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was 25,000 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They called us Ostjuden, which means Eastern Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We—-—we were bom in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My parents had come there as children to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we didn't speak anything except German. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We were Germans but they called us Eastern Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It was Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It's a weird thing to remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Itis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  I can't quite remember the month. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It was before Knistallnacht and this is the incident that triggered Knistallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was a follow-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the reason I remember Thursday is my grandfather lived with us and he was blind and he had never traveled on the Sabbath and they held us until Friday night so that we should have to travel on the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I think back, this small, miserable-mindedness of these people that this 1s what they have on their mind, Let's see if we can inflict -. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, anyway, we're on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I have a beautiful memory of my grandfather starting the Friday night prayers, Lekha Dodi. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That's a memory that I was — I was about six, so the memory 1s very -- that memory 1s very vivid, more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And we — we arrived at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bentschen</span> and we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> and there was a lot of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I know that -- [now know that the number was 25,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I don't think there were 25,000 there the minute that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And surrounded by German soldiers, we were marched towards the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I think it was like a 5- mile walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And at the <span class="DLF">border</span> the -- the Polish guards denied us entry and they had guns and there was chaos, some people were lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and we ended up on the other side of the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we saw horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> coming towards us and it was the Polish farmers who came to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Actually, it wasn't to help us but to help themselves; they took our luggage and took off with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we continued on to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> and -- Z-B-A-Z-N, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> there was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The - the Polish people were very unhappy that we were there but there was really nothing they could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Anda couple of hundred of us ended up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was an abandoned five-story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which I guess was used as a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> and 1t was owned by a Jewish person and we ended up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> and to my knowledge we didn't have any facilities of any kind up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We just had a very crowded <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And some of the people were able to buy straw the first day and — but — and food was a real problem unless you had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But within 48 hours Jewish organizations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> came and so for the next nine months or so for me it wasn't a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">As far as facilities, electricity, heat or things, a kid doesn't accept reality the way itis. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I had my family, we were all together, and I had a couple of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And some of the people with money managed to move out of the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We —we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then around about August of 1939 the German army was amassed on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and the Jewish — we had actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> had organized a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so that everything — the refugees had worked together to make sure that everybody had -- we didn't have much to eat but — but we were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There wasn't enough clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And the reason I know that, I — much later recently got letters that my mother had sent out begging for a jacket that she sent to relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Obviously, they wouldn't have been able to get it to her anyway, but she was begging for anything for herself or for the kids because we really didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But when the -- the organizations made — were making plans to get us onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> on the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> and —. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So amidst all this chaos at the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> — this is a very vivid memory for me because amidst the chaos somebody said that ifanybody signed up for the Kindertransport, there's a chance that it might happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And the -- my mother immediately took me, my brother and my sister and shoved it over to this total stranger and my mother and father got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go there, and I'm sure they had no idea what was going to happen to them or to us but they made — they obviously made a very brave and right decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I didn't appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The — my — my friend was -- I don't want to mention his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My friend was there with us and he was nine years old and he got hysterical and started crying and his mother was on her way to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and she ran back and hugged him and kissed him and took him with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> and they both were murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I found that out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I -I get a little bit emotional when I think about what I felt like then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  My feeling was of anger at my mother because she had not. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But, anyway, we — the three of us, we continued on. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We got onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and that was — and my grandfather at this point had got to an old age <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and so I got to see him one more time and then we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunst</span> to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I was furious at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I was really angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I was angry at my parents because they hadn't done what — what the other one did and — and as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> —- we were supposed to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , they told me Ruth is 14 years old, she's not going on, and I — I found something else to get more furious about and I ran offand I -- remember running and running. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I can —inmy memory Irana long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I don't know what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I knew nobody would find me, but my sister did and she dragged me back and she held on to me while they shaved my hair off to get nid of the lice and shoved me onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and that was the last time I saw my sister so—. We were on the Polish troopship called the Washava (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I think that there were two trips from the Washava taking kinder, taking kids to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">When we got to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , this was at the end and the preparations were not the same as they had been before so, again, it was a little chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I remember somebody getting up and said, "Tm going to give 10 English words and whoever can remember them and tell me what they mean gets a prize." </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And my brother, who was brilliant even then, he was brilliant his whole life, he did and he was given a bag of coins, probably a few cents, and somebody saw that and said, "I'm taking him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with me," and grabbed him and he threw the bag of coins to me and that started off my first year in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The rest of us were sent all over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , me with my bag of coins for which I got a thorough beating for beng a thief. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And my cousin who wasn't — who I don't remember being with me then was put on — was put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Her story 1s a little poignant that when - she had a single mom and when she went to get — go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they were stopped at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, "You can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You've got to go to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So the mother took Rita, my cousin, around the comer, and said, "Go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ," and gave her a bunch of things that she had to go — some valuables so they would have something, and she went back and got her doll, which she still has in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">That's all she came out with. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And she was taken in by a Scottish family who wanted a daughter and they cut off communications to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And she's now a Christian lady and — who belongs to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> and 1s full of guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That's one of the favorite - my most favorite families in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I go to see them often, her husband and her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Her children have Jewish friends and there's a — there's a Jewish spirit in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And she -- she hung onto her name, so her name is — senior moment here — but she kept her German name and her last name, McNeil, is now McNeil, Rita Strausman McNeil. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">For me the first year in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was not a good memory, while my brother had a good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He was taken in by this Jewish family and from there when they were evacuated -- which happened to everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- he went to a Jewish boys' home. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I stayed with Christian families. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The first year I was very, very angry and I was always in trouble, so I got shoved from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, so my first year in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was not -- not a happy event.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  I still keep a little bit in touch with the last family. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The last three years I was with a Christian family and I still keep in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They were very — they were good to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  You don't keep in touch with the first family?</span></p>
