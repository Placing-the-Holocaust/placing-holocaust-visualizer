<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  This was 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  So you were 21 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was 21, that’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And had you liv — when you said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , were you — did you grow up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">outer boroughs</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">July 7, 2011
ANSWER:  I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Had you done — attended <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Had you finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  No, that was the thing you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We were relatively well-off, and also terribly conservative economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for anything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But, there was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that suddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were going to have to take over in some fashion, and this 1s — this would be very dis- disorganizing, as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And so —
QUESTION:  Did he — excuse me — did he have his own business, your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He worked for somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  He worked for the New York state transportation department, and his own job had to do with train wrecks. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">When — when there was an accident, they had a team that went out and tried to find out why it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And he was very good at that business, I guess, because he went right through from — he was a very young man, almost an office boy when he arrived, and worked his way up. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And the thing is, he had no education either. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He — he was born in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , and he went to the good <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I guess you would say he was a very ambitious man, and he read all the time, and that was a great July 7, 2011 influence for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He had me reading Dickens and Dumas when I was nine and 10 years old, but —
QUESTION:  That’s pretty impressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, if you starting at the right end —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  — you know, for instance — well, I guess it was Robert Louis Stevenson, it was — was the start of my foreign education, and — what was it, the — “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treasure Island</span> ” was the first book. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So, he very carefully chose the books to be at a level where I could understand, hopefully, and —
QUESTION:  Were you his only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Were you his only child, or did you have br —
ANSWER:  No, no, there was a girl after me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  So you’re the oldest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, I was — I was the eldest, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And well, at any rate, I — I got a piece of education from reading, and I — the reading habit I got into, and had occasional troubles with my schoolteachers because they didn’t think that the family should race ahead of this program, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Curriculum, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">July 7, 2011
ANSWER:  So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old man, and — but he — he got very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Heart can — heart condition, and we knew he wasn’t going to be around a long time, so we had to prepare for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And the preparation did not include any possibility of going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn’t have much of a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So — but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which actually I developed in the <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And before I got out of <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , I had an idea, I — I had a—I wa — a little play friend, the — these correspondences with children from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Oh, pen-pal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Yeah, one of — one of my teachers went to, of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , <span class="REGION">western Australia</span> , which is just — just about west of anything in the wor — in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And so I-I got the — my friend sent me the local paper — matter of fact, all of the local papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I noticed that one was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">There was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page one and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">This was different, this had headlines on page one [indecipherable] news on page one. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I was really intrigued by this. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I had already started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I July 7, 2011 don’t know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And — and then one day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , would like to have a correspondent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Not a bad notion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in — in Asia who traveled around. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And then they had another correspondent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , which was home to the Australians. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And so these were very special needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">One was, of course, the local aspect, of the — of news, and the other was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And — but I said th — I-I decided to write a letter to the editor. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So I went to the British — the — I don’t read it any more, but oh, I can’t remember the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">At any rate, it’s — was — it’s a—1t’s a British publication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for — that we have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  The Economist? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Would it be the Economist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, no, the —
QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  —no, no, no, this 1— no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">No, it says — A2: You mean like the encyclopedia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Sure, it’s got the name of a — of a the — research publication, but —
QUESTION:  I see, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">July 7, 2011
ANSWER:  But at any rate, it was the one place where they had all of the editors by name, everywhere in the <span class="REGION">British commonwealth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And so I thought, well, in the <span class="REGION">British commonwealth</span> , they speak English, and that’s the only thing I can speak, so I wrote them a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">No mention of grade, age, anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, I had the — and I followed my father’s rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He said, when you write a letter, you keep it on one page, if you possibly can, because you lose the reader on the second page.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Absolutely right. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  And so — so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don’t be fooled by the multi-syllable words. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I just said in plain English that I was a—a journalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their paper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and none in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a correspondent. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I consulted no one, and I got — I had the shivers afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and — and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are — we are interested in you. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let’s consider it a possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And so I did, I— I found the name of the editor of the publication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very July 7, 2011 long article about the failure of the — 0-0-of Roosevelt’s policies. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Because at that time, it were — that was about 1937 was it, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  So you weren’t even 20 years old? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You were like 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I— I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had — had absolutely nothing, so — so —
QUESTION:  But chutzpah. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">A lot of chutzpah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Oh, a lot — a lot of — a lot of gall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  So, Id like to turn this now to — as you’re speaking, a number of thoughts are going through my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">When I’ve interviewed other people who were part of liberating forces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did, to news, to world events, to — 1t — to people who were different from yourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So one of the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to Europe, did you meet anybody who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Well, if you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , chances are you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  You couldn’t miss them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Oh yes, well, that’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish city</span> , almost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  And then my second question 1s, is that if you were interested in news and journalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">July 7, 2011
ANSWER:  Oh, oh certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was right — I — I was reading about Hitler, 1t seemed, when he first came up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  To power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] by — what was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">A famous, very arrogant guy, who seemed to win wars without thinking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">A2: Hindenburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Hindenburg’? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">A2: Talking about Hindenburg, von Hindenburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Von Hindenburg? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">A2: Paul von Hindenburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Paul von Hindenburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Paul von Hindenburg?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  That’s right
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  And — A2: The chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  The chancellor, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And so I a—I was a con — conscious of the growth of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Actually, almost everybody was, but I read so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I read internationally because I was interested in July 7, 2011 international affairs, but I was also — I-I was taught at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you — you’re a man when you gu — when you’re born, and you use your brain from there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And so it was a very good policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I had a mixed literary education, in that I — there was “Tarzan of the Apes,” which I also read, and the bi — the — was it the Hunter boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  A-Another series. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And so here I was reading the classical 20" century — or 19" century literature from Europe, in English, of course, translated, and then these other books, and enjoying them both. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But at any rate, no, I was really up on the news in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There were a lot of other things too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble there. </span><span class="sentence" id="122"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was having a terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">This was followed up by the other activities that are — were very ominous in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They were going after Manchukuo — ma — <span class="REGION">Manchuria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And — and in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> the Italians were trying to take over —
QUESTION: <span class="COUNTRY"> Ethiopia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Ethiopia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So, it was a very disturbing time, interesting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I can’t say that I was scared by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I was intrigued by it, and there was some very good books at the time coming out, various commentators; professional journalists wrote books.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Well, William Shirer, I think, was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, well I — he was a giant in the —
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">July 7, 2011
ANSWER:  — in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But at any rate, there was a great deal of concentration on the things that counted abroad, and also many of the problems at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We had no military policy, and we were — we were terribly weak at the time, and that was one of the big issues coming up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , how do we protect it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  So I’d like to turn it back to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and his role in your education. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And — did these — these events, these world events that you are talking about, not only in Europe but elsewhere, but of course for us it’s particularly what was going on in Europe; were you discussing these at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Oh yes, well, we — we, of course, had dinner every night in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , and it was a conversat-sational sort of sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So we talked about everything, and sometimes when I wasn’t old enough to know, I got instructed from the higher people, my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And yeah, you know, it was a — it was a very good way to get educated, I think, without feeling the pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Yeah, it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It is. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">To have got — to have — to have conversations around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> about important events of the day is something that doesn’t happen that often any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  There were a lot of people then, commentators on radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There was one fellow — what was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">A2: Kaltenborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Yeah, Kaltenborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">July 7, 2011 A2: H—H.V. Kaltenborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He was a — and there was also a man who spoke so fast, we couldn’t eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So we turned him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And Lowell Thomas, and you know, a lot of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  The pretty — pretty much accomplished journalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And the — and who could expound on a-anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I think they had a little more freedom than they do today, because there are other people who popped up and said, you’re wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And so that was a very good example of growing up in a democratic state.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  It was a— it was a fine experience, and a lot of fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  So, did you write — after that first article that you sent to the Australian newspaper, did you become their correspondent? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Did you end up submitting pieces?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Well, I did, actually I did, but that — long before that, they had that article, which was very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It took a whole bedsheet of paper, that they used to print on those days, and oh, they had the [indecipherable] that they — usually you find in the — in the English press, but in the American. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Our correspondent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> —
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  — tell us what in the world is going on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So — so I was astonished, because they were sort of ta — presuming. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They didn’t know how old I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I know they wanted to find the — July 7, 2011
QUESTION:  They didn’t ask the basic questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  They weren’t — well, they wanted to find out, but events were moving too fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  And I was, of course, absolutely stunned, because I had a plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">As soon as I got that rejection, I would write to an English paper in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , and see if I could work on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And there was no — there was no compensation for this, but every few weeks I’d get a very generous check, a hundred dollars, which to me —
QUESTION:  That’s a lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  — was a lot of money, to cover my expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Well, my expenses were because I traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , and you know, were — were very slim. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And — but I—I hada terrible time because I found that between reading about these things and getting an idea of how coverage is done, and then having your pencil in your hand and trying to decide, do I do it, or d-d — or don’t I? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I had a couple of disastrous — potentially disastrous experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">One was Lena Medina. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Lena Medina was a five year old girl in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lima</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> who gave birth to a child — at least the story, this is what the story said. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And my source was I had read it, it was a UP dispatch. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I knew because I’d gotten the — a sort of the copy boy’s job at the “Herald Tribune’ at the — at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I knew that the paper always substituted the UP for AP or anybody else in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , because they felt that it was more reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So in comes this strange story, and I was too young to have the educational experience of anything involving women. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Women were July 7, 2011 there, and what it takes — what I assume it — you know, it assumes that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But at any rate
QUESTION:  That it’s unusual if they give birth at five.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  — this was all to — very unusual, I thought it was — I thought instinctively it was impossible, because I had never met anyone five years old who had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">A2: Reasonable conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  And so I sent in my cable as one of the little stories I had from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , this strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> where five year olds have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And then apparently —
QUESTION:  They printed it, I bet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  They — they printed it, oh what they did though, they did a very clever thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  What did they do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  They also doubted the veracity of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  So they called every [indecipherable] person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perth</span> , and asked them what they thought of it, and they said, it’s crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It can’t be, it’s impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So then they — they ran that story together with my story, in order to take the onus off themselves, in case I —I’d gone crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And — but they had, and they didn’t know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And so then there was that dead — dreadfully dead period, nobody wrote me or anything saying you shouldn’t take these stories seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And I had my explanation all done, because I realized, I talked to some older people, th-they said, oh, that’s ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So then — July 7, 2011
QUESTION:  Trial and error.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Does this mean your journalistic career was born with that article?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  Oh, I don’t know, I had the writing, yo-you know, I’d been submitting stuff, and they’d been printing it, and I got pretty sassy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I expected to see the story repeated, whatever I said, with a byline on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They put a byline every story, even a short one. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And no complaint, no instructions, nothing from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They just let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I had — and then in 1941, I still had this job, and I had the — another one of those shocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I was — I —I had a very weak — weak week. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Poor week for journalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Nothing was developing that I thought I could afford to send. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was 35 cents a na — a — a word, press if I filed. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So I was very conscious of this, par-particularly because of my Scottish ba — July 7, 2011 background, and I didn’t want to waste the paper’s money. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So I came to this crisis where that weekly cable looked pretty feeble. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And there was a big, big event the Wednesday before. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">This was about Friday, I was filing. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And there was a battle at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aron</span> between the French and the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Maybe you remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I don’t know how they [indecipherable] but this was a pretty exciting story because the British and French were allies, and they — the French had been trying to get Admiral Darlan, who was in command of the French forces, to — to surrender, and the — the French were very stubborn; they wouldn’t surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So finally the British said, all right, if you don’t surrender, we’re going to fight you. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And they started this battle, a really horrible thing because the casualty rate was enormous. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Some of the biggest <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> then operating in the two navies, had been sunk, there in <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> , of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Is that where the battle was taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> , okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And so I knew all about this, of course, and then source reports in the general news that so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> had been lost, and so many people had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It was a pretty horrible outcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But I thought [indecipherable] and maybe — maybe I could sneak it in, and they’d realize that I was using old news, but I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And so, oddly enough, they printed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But what they did is they ran — they went to the archives and got the Jane’s book — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jane’s ships</span> , and copied out the pictures that were July 7, 2011 mentioned, all of the casualties, and read it down one side of page one. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And then they sent all of — the few little words I had to say, I never mentioned anything that I — you know [indecipherable] to repeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But obviously the battle had been fought, and I had to say something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So I did that, and that was all printed in eight point type. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So must have been a very impressive thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I never saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  You never saw that piece as it ran?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  No, the paper never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My — every once in a while I’d miss a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So, any rate I —I was agonized when I discovered that they printed it, and no other paper in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> printed it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And so th-there was no wi — no battle and all of its casualties from Brooks McClure. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So I wondered how — how we got around this, and what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Well, what happened was that I — I always made s-small reports, as small as I could make them, and put each story on a different page. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And then I’d sit in the telegrapher’s office and peel them off wa — one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Well, because this was such a bad reporting day, I worked very hard and very late, to get the best I could out of it, and so I guess the cable came in with this odd story in the middle, and the rest of it much less important stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And so the Australian censor then record it. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">What they done is they blanked it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And so, on the next Wednesday was an announcement that Churchill is going to make a special speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so everybody in the world was listening to that, and they heard all about the Battle of Aron, many of them for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So, at any rate, I escaped — July 7, 2011

<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Although the — although I discovered after I got in the air force, that the casualty rate was just as great. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They shoot you out of the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , and — instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So the question — I — I — I wasn’t doing too good at artful dodging, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But at any rate, things were all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I was just getting around, and then finally wind — wound up back in the infantry when Eisenhower declared that they had too many fliers, and — and that they were going to pair — send all the fliers and [indecipherable] specialists, and all the special kinds of people back to the infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Some of them had never been in the infantry when they were put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">If you ever heard of the Battle of the Bulge —
QUESTION:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  — there was a — there was a tremendous of them [indecipherable] to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And to go in to a— toa war like that, that was murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And — but I didn’t — I was sent down to a regular infantry division that was only training. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I-I —
QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Oh, let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Oh, this was late ’43 or early °44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  And I — and I joined this infantry unit, one of the last to go to Europe, actually, and oddly enough, you know, was a late arrival, I was put into Patton’s Third Army, which had one of the dreadful infantry scores — casualty scores. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">July 7, 2011
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So you arrived in Europe — I want to establish this fact: you arrived in Europe when? </span><span class="sentence" id="433">In early *44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Must have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  And we were the last division to arrive, so we were sort of a — a poor gift to the army that got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But we trained very hard, and I had had a little training before, so I felt, they can train me to death if they want to, because I want to be equal to the job when I get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So — but in the meantime there was this typewriter business. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Now, if you can imagine, they had, while we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , they had the typewriter equipment, and they had this special articulated <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , one of those things that swings in all directions, you know, to — to transport it. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And I was tra — I was trained in how to park this thing, and you know, to run it, in case they needed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But — but they had a regular team of transport people who — who normally handled this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Well, I went into the <span class="DLF">field</span> in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> , and did all these things, and that’s the last I saw of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or the — or the computers, the —
QUESTION:  The wireless teletypers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  The tele — wireless teletype. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And they didn’t — course they don’t — didn’t consult me in the service on anything, really, but I didn’t know what ha — what happened to it, but they had forgotten to cancel it or change it in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So there was always this little strange thing, that I went abroad, I was — I was posted in the signal company of the 65" July 7, 2011 infantry division, and got assignments occasionally, but it was not a — not terribly a busy job for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">A division is about 14,000 men, so you can see they had a lot — lot of people that do their normal work. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And — and I never was pressed too much, because I had this secret job. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Nobody ever talked about it, 1t was just — I was just out in the cold, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I got a couple of promotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Well, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">This is wa — something I don’t understand: when you were in the infantry, what was it that you were doing over there in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Well, I was — I was attached to this super-secret mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So, I don’t know, that was enough for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But I was in — getting in a few — few firefights, but nothing —
QUESTION:  So you didn’t really see battle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  You didn’t see battle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Well, sure I f-fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I was shot and — shot at and I shot back, and no, I had enough experience so I could say I was an infantryman, but — but there I was encased 1n this situation, and they —
QUESTION:  Well, what can you tell us — what can you tell us about this su — this secret mission? </span><span class="sentence" id="460">What was its goal, what was its purpose, what was —
ANSWER:  Well, the thing was, they wanted to develop a wireless system, which would connect the — the frontline troops with <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and — in-instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And you can do it with July 7, 2011 teletype, but you can’t do it if you have to have <span class="DLF">lines</span> between teletypes being cut by the enemy all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  And just laying the <span class="DLF">lines</span> is too hideous a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But this was obviously the beginning of a project that we were trying to analyze all the aspects, and see if they can straighten it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I— I could understand, but I never — never thought it was terribly funny, but I happen to be the beneficiary, so I wasn’t going to argue about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Well, as a result though, I had a distorted military career, in which — during which I had the two experiences that we — we were to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  And that we’re — I’m hoping, yeah, that we can now. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So di — does this — the fact that you were 1n this — in this particular — I don’t know if the right word is occupation or activity, is that what brought you closer to — when we’re going to talk about Ohrdruf, that — why you happened to be there at — at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  Well, you know, it’s only because I got into this peculiar subculture —
QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  — in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There were other people in the army, some fascinating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">There — you can’t imagine how some noncommissioned officers got positions of enormous authority, and it’s because of that, in this instance, that I got into one of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The one about the — the wor — the work projects of the — to so many of the Holocaust victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And so from there on I was — I was part of an infantry unit, didn’t July 7, 2011 have to go — di— wasn’t callable and ba — and part of the [indecipherable] and really just give it — I had a lot of free time. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And that was the real trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Free time and McClure don’t go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So I went out, had some adventures. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I was actually AWOL, I guess a ti — absent without leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  And — but nobody missed me, and —
QUESTION:  Were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  — I answered all the — you know, you get up in the morning, they blow the bugle, they get you out, they — they check your name to make sure you’re there. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Then you go to breakfast, and then, of course, McClure vanishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  Where did you vanish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  My wer — might work on a keyboard, but he’s not doing anything most infantry men would respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So, at any rate, the way I — I at some time will get to the — to these two things, two very different experiences, quite profound. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And —
QUESTION:  In all of this, you say you arrived in 1944, early in 1944, and probably it’s a year and some months later, maybe a year and three months later when you come onto <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">In that time, did you know, was it spoken of, was it known about, of what was happening basically to the Jews and others in Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Was it — was — were you aware, were others aware? </span><span class="sentence" id="490">July 7, 2011
QUESTION:  Well, that’s an interesting question because as an individual, I don’t remember being terribly well-informed about — well, once — once they opened <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But before that — well, I was aware of the Saint Louis incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  And the criticism of Roosevelt because he didn’t save those people, keep them from going back and dying, like they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Yes, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  And so I — I was aware of that, and of course I knew that the German propaganda was all anti-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But this business of gathering up people just to kill them, I didn’t — wasn’t aware of being aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And in fact, when I — when — when we discovered that the work quarters of these poor people in <span class="REGION">south Germany</span> , first time we had encountered it — apparently, I don’t know how they got away without being caught, becau — of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is a very big <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  And — and we went after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  So tell us about — you say the first time you encountered this was in <span class="REGION">south Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So was that like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> is —

<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  That’s where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Oh no, no, then we’re going the other direction, then it’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thtirringen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Then — was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> the first time you came into contact with what this policy had been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And I wasn’t the only one, I was — I was one of many, many — everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Nobody —

<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  But — but we had a similar interest, and we joked about — about journalism, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And so it got so, for little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I was mostly idle, in another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">The — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And he’d call on me if he ever had something that — a job to do, that he couldn’t do or — so — so we got pretty chummy. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Then one day a-— one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> showed up first thing in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I — I was just finishing breakfast, I guess, and I was being called by my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and off we went, over to his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and he told me we — we’ ve discovered some anomaly here, strange thing, a lot of people dying and I don’t know, we just got a radio report on this thing at — I need this — h-he — he described it. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Well, he said he — he wanted to send me over there to take a picture of this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">He said we should have pictures of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So he gave me a no — July 7, 2011 a German 35 millimeter camera, one of the best that they make. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And — but it had film in it, I didn’t know the speed of the film, and that was a big handicap because I knew I couldn’t take many pictures in the shadow, if — if — 1f that was standard film. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So, off I went, and they had a driver, really quite incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">He had surveyed the route to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> by — by using a — automobile company maps. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And so we went right there, 1t was no problem, he made no mistakes, he drove right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And we got into the <span class="REGION">area</span> , we didn’t know where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, but we saw all of the military equipment that had been gathering.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  Oh, I didn’t stay very long at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Took my pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I knew they wanted them back at <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and so I — I just about jumped in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and off we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  So were you there a couple hours, perhaps, or half a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Not very much at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I realized early on that I couldn’t spend much time in — inside these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So it was more than one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Oh well, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I think there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I only went into one, but it was a — it was a pretty sizable thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I don’t know how many workers they had to have, or they were using for whatever project they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">They were — they were probably cleaning July 7, 2011 out the — the ... the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know, because the Germans do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They make it a policy, clean out the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">underbrush</span> wherever they are, and they use it, of course, profitably, to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But — and I wouldn’t have been — I don’t know where the — how — I don’t know how — how the civilians managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They — the tradition in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and clean it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Well, you know, if — if the — if the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was two miles away, I don’t know how they would escape being discovered, but I don’t think that’s an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">These — the — the townspeople all knew about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I understand that afterwards, the Americans took the Burgermeister and a number of senior civilian officers up to watch this process that I watched; they were still burying these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  Did you ever write about this after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Did you ever write about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  No, I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">But I — but I — I think that after the war it was well known, and wasn’t quite as dramatic as hanging them with piano wire in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But the — the whole thing is unbelievable, more-so — you know, one says that it’s unbelievable that a group of people would be killed this way, for nothing other than being what they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And that binary nature of these people, who could be very polite and — and com — polite society, in their polite society, and yet they — th-there was — the Germans did an analysis of one of their big meetings and it survived the war, and I saw it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">This was after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And it was appalling to see these people July 7, 2011 who were responsible for th-th-the disposal of human beings, joking about it and going about it in such a detached way. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">No — no — no emotion involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Well, but at any rate, that’s not pertinent to what we’re talking about, but —
QUESTION:  It is, but it is not — it’s not direct witness, it is the impressions that you get after the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  Oh yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  So it ties in, it ties in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It didn’t have to be a visual presentation at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  You just think of the idea, planning and executing these people in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  And this was the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">These were the dregs. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">These were — these were not the people who were employed in [indecipherable] plants all through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or — there — there were a lot of commercial properties that were managed and run by these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Some fantastic stories about that, but seeing it is an emotional experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">QUESTION:  Did you talk about it to your folks when you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  When — when Patton moved on at that clip, that pretty fast clip of moving, you know, such a wall of humanity forward, 50 mi — did you go forward as well, as part of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  No, well, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is vast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  We had the — the — the third army had the southern quarter of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We — we were — were — we were at one point closest to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , then moved down, on orders, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">ANSWER:  And Patton was assigned this last southeastern quarter of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and what went with it, a little bit of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  And — and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">ANSWER:  The Austrian experience is also — that’s where they have separate comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  Id like to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  We were all a little anxious, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We were doing very well, but when you’re in a battle, if you’re moving forward, you feel pretty good about that, but your — you’re further exposing yourself to doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And the — I was — I was not aware of — of this sweep, but I knew it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And in fact, after — after the Battle of the Bulge, our — July 7, 2011 our — our army — I—1I—I-—I’m afraid I —I shouldn’t say our army, I wasn’t in the army, but I — in that army, but because I — of my personal experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">But oh, the casualties were fearsome. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And the men who really fought have a different, instinctive feeling about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">But our infan — infantry really ch — went through them so fast, that we had some surprises. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">We overtook the — the retreat of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">They’d retreat a while, then they’d surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And so — but as I say, in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> they got another picture of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  What happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  Because they were — these were civilians and — and the Austrians that were in the army were, of course, in the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And so they didn’t have much to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I know wa — in our experience, the Austrian takeover was a cinch, after the fighting that we had done before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  Was this already — if you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> in a — in April, where did you — when the war ended in early May, do you remember that, where you were at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  Yes, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Sure, I — the — the end of war 1s really the end of war for — for the Austrians, there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And all the pretty girls, some very eager to cooperate ger — Austrians, but not — not resisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We had to face the possibility that we’d have to fight July 7, 2011 through it, but they didn’t have — they did — they didn’t have a home guard or anything, to give us any trouble, so [inaudible]
QUESTION:  Let’s talk then about that second — second episode —
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, well, that’s a different thing entirely, and — and in retrospect, it’s a funny experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I enjoyed it so much afterwards, because 1t was so dangerous when it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  So tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  I— we were — we were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , in <span class="REGION">western Austria</span> , and I was — I — I had attached myself to the — to the intelligence section of the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And get — got to know a very affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">He was an infantry officer, a big man. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I — apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">But at any rate, I reported in one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">It was across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I was with ya — with my infantry friends, and — eating there and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So I came in one morning, about eight o’clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can’t remember — and that’s a shame, you know, that just — should never forget the name of somebody who made such an impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But at any rate, he was a good — good old boy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he looked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much appreciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So, he had come into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> just before me, and he got a call from the director of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him July 7, 2011 this way, but he heard about the — the exchange of troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">We had gone on the — on the u-upper Austrian side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Donau river</span> , and had — the Russians had moved in too far when we — when we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">There was a clerical error. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So that was passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">The Russians were in that <span class="REGION">territory</span> , we didn’t try to throw them out, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But they were advanced maybe — maybe a couple of miles on — on what was supposed to be a straight line of division. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And so they now — now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they’d better change this. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo — we’d move forward into that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And when — although we didn’t know anything, or I didn’t know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don’t know, that means I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But at any rate, I didn’t know there were planning to do this, they didn’t consult me. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And so, both the major and I were very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And — excuse —
QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">ANSWER:  The director at that time said that no, there were no pictures, but that we could see that there were <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> where pictures had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And we didn’t know what — what wa — happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">So — but nevertheless, any amount of questioning as the director, July 7, 2011 produced no answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And then of course, suddenly, the — there came this change, and he discovered what he knew, or something, that the pictures were in a certain <span class="DLF">farm</span> wa — in a—1na <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , couple of miles in — 1n that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And so he said —
QUESTION:  Where the Russians were — where the Soviets were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And he had — he had the — in fact, address. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">He knew exactly how to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">He’d obviously checked somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">What they were, were cases, beautifully made, of wood, for each picture, whether it’s small or large, and were beveled off so that they wouldn’t hurt anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And he said, he se — he was sort of apologetic because he knew he should have revealed this before. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Although I do — I think if that had happened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So we’re probably lucky that this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And — and so, they — I’m — I’m surprised they didn’t have Russian guards on — on these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">But, at any rate —
QUESTION:  Did he ask — was his request to your Irish American major that — that the Americans go and get his pictures back? </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Was that what the request was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">ANSWER:  No, it was a sort of a— a spontaneous reaction of idiocy by everybody there, you know, they — they really — we all agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  That you had to get the pictures back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  Yeah, had to get the pictures back. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And I don’t know what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I — I’m not prone to make profound decisions like this, but — but he went around, and asked each soldier, do you want to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="965">It’s a little dangerous, but let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">July 7, 2011
QUESTION:  And this is your major? </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">ANSWER:  Yeah, this fella, he didn’t know any more than I did really, but at any rate, he’s a very low rank in that big army, and he was making an awful decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">But he — we could have all been wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Was the craziest thing, going over the <span class="DLF">Linz bridge</span> , to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Donau</span> , and feeling that you might be going to your death. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Anyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or something, whatever had been assigned to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And it was a — I thought it was a comical thing afterwards, but I didn’t think that — very much that way at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">So we all went in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , with the major out ahead in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and most of us back in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We had two big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and we didn’t know how much we were going to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were driving, I wouldn’t have been that — that — that good. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">But we arrived in there, in the top of an enormous <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">You know the way those <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> were constructed? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">They used the upper levels for hay that they dropped down in the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And so there were the pictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow — for the — the bulls, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And the — we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot — not — not — not the — the heaviest thing was an unusual shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">It was about two feet wide, two feet high, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">We c — we — we could move the pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn’t know what it was, we couldn’t take the time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take — take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So for July 7, 2011 our two and a half ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , we — we put it on the — the — down early. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">But it took all the muscular strength we could master. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And so when we got back, w-we drove back, and that was a terrorizing experience, because there was nothing but death. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Nothing moved in that whole distance that we had —
QUESTION:  You did — did you —
ANSWER:  — that — that they had evacuated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">QUESTION:  So no people were there, at the —
ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">QUESTION:  No people were at the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , or —
ANSWER:  No, no, well, I’m sure there’s some took the alternative of going into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , to be discovered later. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But an awful lot of them went visiting the relatives and friends in the safe part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">QUESTION:  No Soviet soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">ANSWER:  Hm’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="992">QUESTION:  Did you see any Soviet soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  No, I saw — I didn’t even see an — an ordinary dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">You know, they — the little street dogs everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  But we saw nothing breeding in that <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">QUESTION:  The dogs went visiting too? </span><span class="sentence" id="998">July 7, 2011
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I mean, they went visiting or — or hid in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But at any rate, it was just a naked run really, from the safe sa — <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to this — and it wasn’t too long, and so I figure a couple miles, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Then we loaded it all up, and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And of course, that was the loneliest automobile trip I ever made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And so we went across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and got back, and we — we decided to put it in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , we could put a guard on it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And we didn’t have anybody el — of the ability to examine them, and we — we didn’t want to — there, there was a — was a big <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in — in <span class="REGION">south Germany</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> th — yielded an awful lot of those paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And they had — there we had some American — those specialists, who knew these paintings, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You needed somebody like that to make a judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">QUESTION:  Did you open up the cases, though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  No, but we did open up one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">The major said, that damn thing that [indecipherable] and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He wanted to see what was in it, so we opened it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Was a beautifully encased box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And what was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">It was a rowing machine with a [indecipherable] iron base, that apparently the officers wanted to take with them, or get rid of, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Didn’t want to yield to the Russians, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">So in all that happened, we had a good laugh after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">ANSWER:  Bu-But [indecipherable], it tied us up for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">July 7, 2011
QUESTION:  So was this — did this whole thing es — did this whole adventure take half a day? </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">A day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  Oh, well you can be sure we did it as fast as we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">ANSWER:  And that — see, that was early in the morning when we first got the word, and the major took no — no time making arrangements with the <span class="BUILDING">motor office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And, we were up and gone in — 1n a matter, I’m afraid, of minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Every able-bodied soldier 1n the <span class="REGION">area</span> were — well, at least there was a mass of early risers, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And the major went around, asked each one of them, you know, why they — why they do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">QUESTION:  Any flak about it —

<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">QUESTION:  Any flak about it from the higher ups later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1029">ANSWER:  None — none that I heard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I didn’t stay on very much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I got reassigned to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I was going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they put me in a safer <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But oh, I was — that was quite an experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">QUESTION:  Quite an adventure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And I —I — I thought it was, thinking about it afterwards, I thought it was pretty darn clever of these fellows to say yes, you know, that’s — then it’s a very freaky thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I’m sure that if you ask the same people, a lot of them would have said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But that’s th — I know how those things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">July 7, 2011
