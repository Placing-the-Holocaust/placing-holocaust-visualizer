<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  So when did you reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> in '40. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And from '40, I worked under the Russian regime in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Did you witness any deportations done by the Russians during 1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Just right before the war or the outbreak of the war, the Russians deported a lot of Czernowitz people which had been before well-situated, good situated. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Had <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> or he was a lawyer, even a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They took a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was one tailor, a Social Democrat, they took him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  You are talking about Jewish people?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Can you estimate how many people were deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , a rough estimate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, at that time probably 5,000 and 7,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They took from the <span class="REGION">province</span> , also. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And they made it, from the <span class="REGION">province</span> , they made everything of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  But when you say 5 to 7,000, you are talking only about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , or about the whole occupied...
ANSWER:  It's about the whole...
QUESTION:  About the whole?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  ... because that is only the people who were good situated, the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They didn't touch other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The Romanians touched everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Can you tell us what happened to you, and to your family once the military operations started in June 1941, the military operation done by Romanians and Germans against Soviet Union?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I was at that time -- my parents were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My brothers were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I was the only one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , and I was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And when I -- when the deportations began, they deported me, my wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  I would like you to tell us a few words, 1n a few words what happened to you before the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I mean, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> was occupied by the Romanians sometime in June, and you were deported sometime in October, if I'm correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So I would like to know what was the life at the beginnings of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , your life...
ANSWER:  Life was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Life was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We couldn't get -- we didn't have any work to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We couldn't do, but we were taken out for forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was taken out by my hair, and to clean the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There was a big <span class="DLF">park</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , Folksgarden (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="69">What we had to do is clean the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We did all kinds of forced work, forced labor, but we didn't get paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Do you remember when was the Yellow Star introduced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , if it was any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  The Yellow Star, yeah, the Yellow Star was. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But it came about two months or three months before the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">In fact, I was in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when they told me to come, but I didn't have the Yellow Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He told me "Where is your Hakenkreuz?" </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I said, "I have no Hakenkreuz." </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He said, "You need a Hakenkreuz." </span><span class="sentence" id="78">A Yellow Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And by -- he didn't punish me, but 1t was some, I would say, a rarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Because other people have been very much punished when they didn't carry a Yellow Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was sealed and when the deportations started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Well, we -- when they started, every day they eliminated one or two <span class="DLF">streets</span> where we have been before. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And they pushed us more and more to another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which was in old time inhabited by a lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">This is not . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And they pushed us every day, they closed the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I lived, for example, close to the <span class="BUILDING">National Theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One day they came in and said, " . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">You cannot live anymore here." </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And we had to take whatever we could take by hand and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So that was two or three days, and then they sealed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And we were in a very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and about a day later started evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They drove us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and we had -- and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And we couldn't take anything, only what we can carry.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Akaki (ph) was the first before. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Akaki was still Romanian, and then came the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> and we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And that was a very bad view that we have seen from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akaki</span> , because before us there are other people already. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The Yelets (ph) from four parts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  And did you meet these people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yelets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  No, I didn't meet because when we came, they were driven further. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were driven further, and we were only about a day and a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And then the next day they started to drive us. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was raining all night, it was a very cold, and you couldn't walk because it was a morass. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And they drove us, we got hit -- I got hit by a Romanian soldier here and there and to let go my package. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I let go, but my wife asked him "Look, I want to have this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Give it to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So somehow he gave it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And that package was my documents, my certificates from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> from my diplomas in engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And then we were walking, walking; suddenly, I fell because I slipped and fell into -- it was <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But I got up to here, and I knew I couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My wife wanted to reach out for me, but she couldn't, she was pushed further from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Because she couldn't stop, she was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Somebody, probably a man, gave me his hand and pulled me out, so I came -- I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I couldn't even thank him, I didn't know who it was because he was pushed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We were so driven and hit by the soldiers that we couldn't even breathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  This was where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akaki</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akaki</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  They pushed us towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnestr</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My wife already knew that I'm dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But then later I did find her on the shore of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akaki</span> , and we went over at night and in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Some people before us and after us were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They turned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> , and fell in the cold water and they drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We somehow survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Later on I did find my mother-in-law and my two sisters also. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They survived and were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , in an old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It was -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was uninhabitable, but it was there, so we started -- we had been united. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The next day I heard that there was somebody who would make work for -- working for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Looking for workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Workers who know their , SO I went to see this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">When I -- in order to come there, I had to go to a <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to streets I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But I saw that the Romanian soldiers and Ukrainians were banded together and robbing the people they met in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I went and zigzagged not to meet the people, and I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dnestr</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But there was a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they told me this is the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the rabbi (ph), and there is Yegendorf (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I entered this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I asked a woman, "I want to speak to Yegendorf." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She told me "Yegendorf is not here, he will come and then you can talk to him." </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I didn't know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I said, "How should I recognize Yegendorf?" </span><span class="sentence" id="144">She told me, "He has a white collar, he is always white collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It's nice." </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And so I recognized him. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">When he came from the Prefect, he told me then he came the Prefect. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I told him who I am, what I do and I would like to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He said to me, "All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Come tomorrow 7 o'clock in the morning."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  You were an engineer, correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yes, I was an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I still am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">In what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Mechanical engineer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Mechanical engineer, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  And so next day, I came and we all went to see this Timisoara (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And he went along at my side, and he asked me, "What can we do here? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">What can we do here and here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I said, "It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do." </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He said, "All right." </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So that was the beginning of my relationship with Yegendorf. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He made me -- I have this document as a , the chief engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He was the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , who was on the . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Yegendorf was also on the . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So this Bingerstratts was made chief engineer; I was his deputy. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So we started little by little, we started to build up this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Yegendorf was in the beginning a nice fellow, but the more power he got the more he became brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And he was intellectually a lightweight, but there were people around us, which certainly you know, there was a Dr. Kessler (ph), a lawyer, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Donetsk</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He was a very, very clever man and a highly intelligent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Kessler was his alter-ego for Yegendorf. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">If Kessler proposed what to do, Yegendorf signed and said, "I did it." </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And so it went with a lot of penchants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">People did a lot of things to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Can you explain how come this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span> (ph), this <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> , was created? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">What was the interest of the Romanian authorities to create the <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> and why they wanted -- why they went ahead with this idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Well, so far as I know, there was a lot of people, the prefect of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> had some people around himself that were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Yegendorf had some people around him that were also Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And they made business, one group with the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">In order to make business and that it should be something we make work for the benefit of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so it was war. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">The Timisoara (ph), which could repair <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , tractors, and do other things, was very important for the Germans and for the Romanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And besides, the great motive of this, I believe, was people -- the Romanians, the Prefect, the Major of the gendarmerie, who was -- they wanted to make business; they wanted to get rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And my personal opinion is that this 1s our luck, because we could corrupt them with money and we could stay there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  So if I understand when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> was practically a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which had this <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> , this Timisoara (ph), as the main industrial unit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The Timisoara (ph) was there when the Russians had -- after they were done. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">When they left they destroyed a lot of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Now, Yegendorf and Prefect Bayona (ph), who was, by the way, an Austrian-Romanian, he was serving in the Austrian Army during the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Yegendorf was a lieutenant of the First -- in the Austrian Army of the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So they had a common language. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They both spoke German, and they both understood each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They made it in order to have a hinterland. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">To provide for the army, for the force or whoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And we did a lot of things for the army, for the Romanian Army and for the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The Germans came in and gave the order and we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">In the beginning we had our difficulties because we -- there was not instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We had to begin from zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The first hammer we made, I remember there was an old man by the name of Bloan (ph) Schmitt. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And he took a piece of iron and two bricks and put a fire in the two big bricks, and put the iron in the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Then with another brick, he hammered this out and we had the first hammer. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So we made instruments and we made instruments for our lathe machine, for our planning machine, for our blazer, the Timisoara (ph) infected was a -- have a molten, the tron started to work and we did a lot of things over for the government, for the Romanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And, by the way, some people made money, the big ones of the Romanians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  If my understanding is correct, some of the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> were deported later from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szydlowiec</span> , am I correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Can you elaborate on this? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Can you describe to us what happened?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Well, it was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The beginning was very, very difficult because we didn't have anything, and we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I mean, we had to work, so we made whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Ingenious, we have invented a lot of things to make instruments and then with one -- the moment I had one lathe at hand, we started to repair another. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So little by little, we became a very well organized <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , because we had a lathe and then the Timisoara (ph) -- as such and then we had one department we made smaller things. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was run by another colleague of mine very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">He made all kinds of screws and blades and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And that was what we had to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Yeah, that I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Yegendorf was a very good organizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He knew a lot about administration, but he was not a very good engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And he was a man who knew so much, but when somebody came around who knew a little bit more, 1t was his -- he was an enemy of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yegendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Couldn't exist anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We as engineers, we were all young engineers, we know all the engineers always likes to talk about his days when he became an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He never talked to us, he always dealt with us as in facto. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You are in this department, you do what I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">He came around and my people made lighters, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And he went around and looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And one day he caught me, but I didn't tell him what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And he said to me, "What are they doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And then I had to tell him they were lighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And he was very angry, he said, "You do this and you sell it, and then I have to defend you. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The gendarmerie will ask about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I said, "Mr. Engineer, he is hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He doesn't do it all the time, he did it once." </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So when he caught somebody with a lighter, he punished him very severely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  He said, "If you do it one more time, you lose the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You lose your way 1n this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You cannot live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And you lose the Timisoara (ph), and that means that." </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And he was not shy to threaten us with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">He was very severe, but, by the way, he was a good organizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He dealt with the gendarmerie and the Prefect. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I believe his people from the Prefect who were Jews, and Yegendorf's people around him who were Jews, they made business with one each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And that was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They also paid money. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">For example, they bought big jewelry for the women of the Major, diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And so they corrupted, and that was the way it went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Sometimes he was very courageous, Yegendorf. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">When people attacked us or beat some Jews, he said, "You cannot beat these people because they are mine." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">One officer, Romanian officer, beat him and made him sick, but he was -- I must say that this officer was very severely dealt with by the Prefect. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But he was courageous, he was a good organizer, but he was not a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Man with compassion, that he was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And he always, always had in his mind was "I am number one." </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And he met people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , from the government, talked to him and he was by -- want so much influence that he made a scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He made a proposal, how to organize the Jews in grand scheme, in the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> to repair the industry and all the workshops and to make them workable. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And that was he should be on the top of that, and we should be his servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now, I didn't know about that, only when I saw the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That in my mind made him very low. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">This 1s war -- I don't want to use it -- but it's like a war criminal because in times of war then your friends are your enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But what we had to do under the impression, under the pressure, we had to do, that is one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But when we voluntarily do something, this is different.</span></p>
