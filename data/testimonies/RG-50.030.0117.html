<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Uh, can you please tell us your name and when you born and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Paul Kovac. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">It uh is pronounced Kovach, in my mother tongue. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , in a small city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> on the 6th of December, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Uh can you tell us your earliest recollections of, from your childhood about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  We used to live in a small city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martin</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> but my father was a professor at a small <span class="BUILDING">agricultural college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My grandparents used to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren _in</span> and that's where my mother went when I was to be born. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I used to attend the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martin</span> and that's where we used to live until September of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Since my father was a professor at this <span class="BUILDING">college</span> he was sort of indispensable and uh he was exempt from having to wear the David Star in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak state</span> where it was otherwise compulsive for everybody of Jewish origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">This uh privilege was also given to the whole family, uh that is for my mother and also for my grandparents, who who came to live with us uh in the mid-forties, probably in '43 and uh that's when they left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martin</span> to live with us, because it was safer for them to stay with the breadwinner who was actually exempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about your birth certificate? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">There was something unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Uh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">As a matter of fact I, shortly after I was born, simply because it was safer, my parents had me convert to to Roman Catholicism. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I became Roman Catholic and actually this shows on my birth certificate where the religion from Israeli was changed to Roman Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">On the old piece of paper it is still obvious that the change was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It shows on the aged piece of paper where on the <span class="DLF">line</span> which shows religion, there's a sort of faint uh piece of, faint piece which shows that the the change was made there. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh I was not brought up in a very religious way but uh after the war I attended uh religious classes with the other Roman Catholic kids in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and this uh was the case until 1949, when uh religious classes were no longer compulsory at <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> because of the change in the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Did you know of being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Yes, I knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But uh my family was a family of non-practicing Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We were never very religious and therefore I was not brought in brought up in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  What do you recall of the Germans coming to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and how did that change your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, actually I didn't actually see the German soldiers come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The way our life changed was that uh in late August of 1944, when there was a time of Slovak national uprising, my father was notified somehow by his friends that the situation is becoming more dangerous for Jewish people, and he was uh advised to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh there was a small agricultural uh <span class="DLF">farm</span> associated with the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> where my father used to teach, and he was able to steal a horse and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , and he put the whole family on this with very few belongings and we went to one of his former acquaintances who was a farmer and who used to come to my father for advice and they somehow became friendly and my father considered this to be a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, at least in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And this farmer, I don't recall his name, but this farmer had he had again some other friends, farmers further in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and that's where we were directed. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I don't really recall how we got there but this was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klenowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The farmers in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klenowitz</span> used to operate in such a way that their <span class="BUILDING">family homes</span> were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> but their their <span class="DLF">farms</span> , their <span class="DLF">fields</span> , their animals, were further in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and they had a second <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there where they used to stay during the summer when they had to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Now we, the family of five now - my grandparents from my father's side and the three of us - went to one of these farmers with the family of Pavel Vancik and his brother Andrei Vancik. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father, my mother and myself, we stayed with the family of Pavel and my grandparents stayed on another <span class="DLF">hill</span> with the family of Andrei Vancik. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We spent most of the time from September until, from September 1944 until uh April 1945 with these families, and we only in...only occasionally had to leave when it was more dangerous, it would be more dangerous for us to stay with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">During those times we had to leave, we were helped by the family, Vancik family who took us further to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where they knew some lumberjacks who had their <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> there, and uh it was considered more more safe and uh more difficult to access by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I remember one occasion when we stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> which was situated very close to a nearby <span class="DLF">road</span> that a column of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cars</span> loaded with German soldiers and pulling some other military equipment came close to this to this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and uh they were attacked by a group of three partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">There was a short exchange of bullets and uh it ended up by killing these three uh partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I remember that uh when this all ended we we went to see these these dead bodies and the adults who were in our group actually buried these bodies very close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Also, uh when this shooting ended, the Germans decided not to go any further into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh they were ready to leave, but the <span class="DLF">road</span> was very narrow and they had to turn this uh equipment and also the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> - there was one cannon which had to be turned, and uh during this process there were few minutes that the cannon pointed actually at the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> where we all stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There were family, families, maybe three or four families, where there were also adults and children, and out of desperation I believe, the adults asked all the kids to line up 1n front of this small <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Probably they wanted to make it pretty obvious that there are children there and wanted somehow to prevent the Germans somehow from from attacking us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Well, this probably worked because the Germans didn't actually shoot at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They turned and then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But 1t was very dramatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  What are your recollections of your life in hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What was what was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">How did you eat? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What what was your daily life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, this family, Andrei Vancik family and Pavel Vancik family, they the adults were about of the same age as my parents and they had kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh I remember that there were some boys and some girls, but we were about the same age, so we spent our days 1n a in a very common way as probably any other families would would spend. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Occasionally my father had to leave because there was some news uh coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that Germans were about to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to look for partisans, and at that time it would be dangerous for any man to be found because they would be uh either sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> or if they were they would be found that they are Jewish then obviously they would be either shot on the spot or would be send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In this way actually uh my cousin's father was shot in in front of his mother's and his own eyes because they were hiding somewhere and were caught by by Germans and he as a man found being Jewish was shot on the spot, and uh my cousin and my his mother was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so you know in order for this not to happen to us, my father always left somewhere when we were notified that the Germans were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I remember one one occasion like this when I remember there was a heavy snow before, night night before, and uh he left to hide himself in the snow in the in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and when he came back several hours later, he was almost completely frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had to somehow rub his uh body and uh try to somehow revive him. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He must have had very a very strong constitution because I don't remember his getting sick or anything but I know that it was it was terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Did you have contact with other villagers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">As a matter of fact uh it was a large family, these Vancik people people. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We came into direct contact also with some other members of the family but I don't recall our going down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We stayed most of most of the time in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , so there was not much much contact with other people but some members of his family, of family, Vancik family occasionally showed up and we spent some time with them, but well there was not much social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I can tell you that. (</span><span class="sentence" id="60">Pause)
QUESTION:  What else do you recall about hiding? (</span><span class="sentence" id="61">Pause) Do you remember any particular person especially who influenced you during that time? (</span><span class="sentence" id="62">Pause)
ANSWER:  I don't seem don't seem to recall anything. (</span><span class="sentence" id="63">Pause)
QUESTION:  What happened after that period of time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  You mean after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Yes, after after, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">What was the liberation like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  We were liberated in uh in 1945 uh in the Spring by the Russian Army; and I remember that uh with this army of Russians also a lot of Romanian troops came. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They were probably supporting the Russians after...after the Romanian government uh turned against the Russians, uh against the Germans because it was pretty obvious that obvious and also convenient because uh it was obvious that the Germans are going to loose the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">After, right after the liberation, my father got a job with the new minin...newly formed Ministry of Agriculture and we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klenowitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KoSice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The first Czechoslovak government was set up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KoSice</span> , as the government moved to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And that's where I actually got all my education, and I lived there until 1981.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  What was your life like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> as a Jew after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Uh, well, I...as I mentioned before, I have not been brought up in a religious way. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We were non-practicing. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh my father was an idealist and a naive person in a way, because he believed that assimilation will help him avoid anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And it may have worked to a certain point. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Uh I remember that some of his older documents are still carrying his original name, Kohn, and some early documents like his uh wedding papers already carry his name, Kovac. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh we have never belonged to any congregation, simply because we didn't want to be conspicuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I actually don't seem to recall anybody of the family going to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , ever - except maybe when some friends had a wedding there or that was probably the only time. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">When I remember I went to the one and only uh working <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The other <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , a very old beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , was never operating as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was used as a as a <span class="INT_SPACE">store room</span> for something and later it was also torn down when there was a construction of the new <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Somehow that seemed to be the best place to build a new <span class="DLF">bridge</span> so that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> could be torn down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  How did you go on with your education at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Well, I attended my my basic education I attended in <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and uh later I was admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">technical university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> and I don't seem to recall suffering much from anti-Semitism until after I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It could be because of the overall atmosphere was not such that it was uh good for those who would want to express their anti-Semitism to really do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">All simply because I didn't advertise for myself as being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But somehow it works in such a way that even though I don't know how, everybody finds out about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And whenever it's convenient, they let you know that you are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">This happened to me during my later years when I was already employed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">If there was things which I was not allowed to do or were forbidden for me to do, then the explanation was uh indirectly made in such a way that I am different than everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They didn't really call me names, but it was pretty obvious what the reason was that I couldn't do this or that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  What was your <span class="DLF">field</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What did you study and how did you proceed in your career?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  I finished...I got a degree, a Master's Degree, 1n Chemistry from <span class="BUILDING">technical university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">After finishing my education there, I I went to to serve in the army for one year, and after that I entered the <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> of Slovak Academy of Sciences to work on my thesis, on my Ph.D. thesis. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">After that I got a job with Slovak Academy of Sciences and from there also I was able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for fifteen months as a post-doctoral fellow to work for the Department of Biochemistry at <span class="BUILDING">Purdue University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lafayette</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I spent uh fifteen months there, and uh ironically I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in December 1968. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That is after the August occupation by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Uh of course uh coming back was a big disappointment for me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">What the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> looked like and how the life changed and everything, and it took me thirteen years to eventually get an exit visa to visit some relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and that was when I made my decision to eventually immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  When did you get married, and uh was Judaism a factor in your marriage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Uh I got married in 1962. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The...the marriage ceremony was a was a civil ceremony, neither ...neither Jewish or Catholic or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And uh actually we have brought up our son in a very similar, non-religious way. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He knows who he 1s, what his heritage 1s, but uh we have never emphasized the religion very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  When and how did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  We came in 1981, in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We didn't really jump the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , but in a way we escaped anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Uh we got permission to visit my wife's sisters who happened to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And uh we simply packed whatever we could and left everything else behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> you came here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we were we immediately as we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we first uh tried to, I tried to get a job either in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">This didn't work out because 1981 was a very bad year economically both in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and in Europe, and since I was in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> before, that was my next choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I have a distant cousin in <span class="REGION">California</span> , and uh with his sponsorship it was rather easy uh to get here within a relatively short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We first went to HIAS in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and with their help we were able to take care of the formalities in a rather uneventful way. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It took us only six weeks and we had our visas and were flown to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I remember that with my with my cousin's friend uh help it took me only two weeks to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was not the best job, but it was a job and I could start working again as a chemist. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I had a job with a small <span class="BUILDING">chemical company</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torrence</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was a very good experience for me, and this is how I first encountered private industry 1n this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But uh I always wanted to work in research because this is how I was trained. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And uh luckily I managed to obtain this position at the National Institutes of Health; first as a visiting scientist, and later I was tenured. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We became citizens of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1986. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We applied five years to the day when we landed in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and it took about three or four months to get a citizenship then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experiences during the Nazi era?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Well, to make these things a little bit easier to understand why...why uh it happened only in 1944 that we had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , probably it would be good to mention that, in a way, we owe our survival until '44... It's...1t's an irony, but we owe it to the Munich Pact. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Because during that time - I mean, this was the...this was the way for the Slovaks to get their autonomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">When <span class="REGION">Czechoslovak Republic</span> was first cut into pieces, then the eastern part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> became an independent Slovak state; and this 1s what the Slovaks always wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They always felt oppressed by either Hungarians or the Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And throughout several hundred years, they have never been independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And uh they accepted, actually, this tragedy--the Munich Pact-- because this gave them the the opportunity to become independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Hitler actually used <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak state</span> as a showcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He showed the rest of the world that a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which 1s actually under their command can be prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And many educated people of Jewish origin were able to survive, because they were sort of indispensable. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So they were exempt from, for example, wearing their David Stars-- which was normally an obligation for everybody who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I was able to attend <span class="BUILDING">public kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My father was able to keep his job until 1944--September. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Until after the Slovak National Uprising, when the things became more dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  And you had mentioned something about Jews fighting in the Slovak...the Slovak Army, even.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Well, this was another privilege sort of which the citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> of Jewish origin were granted, to serve in Slovak Army against the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Actually my uncle, my father's brother, younger brother, died on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> as a member of Slovak Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">This is how the Germans wanted to show the rest of the world that they are treating everybody equal in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Thank you very much for the interesting story. </span>
