<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Let's start with you introducing yourself, saying where you live now ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Walter Meyer, M-e-y-e-r, I was Born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , K-a-s-s-e-l, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and grew up mostly in the Rhineland and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> and I've been in way over 50 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and have lived in the <span class="REGION">Lone Star state</span> known as <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , for some 30, more than 30 years, and I live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Do you remember your grandparents, can you tell us who they .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yes, in part, simply because, not because my memory is so bad, but because my grandmother on my father's side, died when I was rather young and my grandmother on my mother's side, died before I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">So I do remember my grandfathers, one I loved dearly, and the other one I kind of feared, sometimes despised. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">That was the, my father's father who was a police lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">They used to call him the , or the police Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> he became quite famous, because he apprehended one of the, I think he was called the terror of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , a man who had a killed a number of little children, so he was the one who apprehended him and then he became famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Also, he was considered the strongest man, because they had a contest, who could pull the most roller skaters, well he won that contest, and he was very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don't remember ever having seen him laugh and he had memorized catechism and served as an altar boy, or as an altar man in his case, and oh I see him very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was very unkind to my mother, so that's probably why I didn't like him very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Paul Meyer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Paul Meyer, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And the one you loved so dearly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  The one I loved dearly was my mother's father. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He was a specialist in roofing cathedrals and domes and in addition, he was forest ranger for some duke and I remember him, he could kind of twist his legs one more time than I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He had legs about as long as Gary Cooper, and he was kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Whenever he came to visit, which was not very frequent, he brought me the kind of present that I enjoyed, like a trumpet or something like that, oh yes, I remember him for his much kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  And his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  His name was Wilhelm Summerhowser(ph), they came from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Summerhowsen(ph</span> ) and he died, oh I don't remember exactly the year, but it was in the forties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  ,
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  How about, tell us about your mother and your father, where they lived , you know about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, my father, I have to go back a little and tell you a little story about my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My grandfather came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="REGION">Eifel region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The <span class="REGION">Eifel region</span> goes all the way up to the , where they had the major battles in World War One and World War Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollerath</span> , you want me to spell it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  H-o-|-l-e-r-a-t-h, that is called the snow Eifel, that's the upper Eifel, right on the <span class="DLF">Belgian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So I have relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I have relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Well, that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had 600 people and the girls there, of course there was no contraception, so people had many children, but they were extremely poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I think the richest farmer had four cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I used to go to take care of the cows so they wouldn't walk into the <span class="DLF">potato fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Anyway the girls in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , since the parents had difficulties feeding them, would send them down to the valley to work as maids and prosper to find a husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">When my father's mother, she was one of those who was sent down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olef</span> , O-l-e-f, and she came into the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> of the family, Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They were farmers and schoolteachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Well it looks like my grandfather and my grandmother, yep, had a little relationship in the haystack and as a consequence she became pregnant and she was told to go back to her mother, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollerath</span> , in 1890, when that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was extremely was extremely poor, and the neighbors, when they found out, they were staunch Catholics, when they found out she was pregnant, threw stones at her until the priest, the pastor , may he who cast the first stone, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So, in the haystack, they'd made a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> with straw and that's where my father was born and he stayed there until he was 12 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  He lived in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollerath</span> , in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> until he was 12, then my grandfather, the Meyer, he was offered a job by , which was one of the largest steel producers, they made seamless steel parts, they asked him to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , this is the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to take care of the horses and carry steel parts to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">This is how then my father came to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And he didn't even speak German, he only spoke the dialect of his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and when he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they put him in the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> where all the, generally you put the retarded ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And he told me that when the principal came once, he asked, what is that boy doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Oh, he is from the <span class="REGION">Eifel region</span> , he 1s a little retarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So to overcome the situation, he spent every minute in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and he came one of the most educated, self-educated man I ever met. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And changed jobs and every job was an improvement, see, until he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My mother was pregnant 10 times, but lost babies and a brother of mine was born, a year and a half earlier than I and one earlier and then of course my father moved again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> and worked for Hensel(ph), which was at the time the largest <span class="BUILDING">locomotive factory</span> in the world and he was in charge of export and took care of the linguistic aspect of exporting and so on, because he had acquired a number of languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Already I am speaking about my father being my father, but actually maybe I should tell you that he volunteered in World War One to the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> , which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> in order to learn French. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And he was in World War I from the first day to the last day and was in every major battle and wounded three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Before the war started, he came to marry my mother, and then orders came, the war had started, so he couldn't stay, but three days and then he went back and my mother was born in M-u-c-h, pronounced in German , which is also in the <span class="REGION">Rhineland areas</span> and she was born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> , which became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> and I already mentioned her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When my mother was two years old, her mother died during childbirth, and my grandfather, not being able to cope with children, married the housekeeper of the local priest and she was the, what you read in books about stepmothers, she was a witch. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I don't remember her and if I did, I would try not to remember her. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So there was quite a bit of child abuse, and then when my mother was 14, she was given a -- five marks or something like that, walk 10 miles to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and buy a ticket, fourth class, that was a little above the cattle and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and you were expected there and my father met, my mother then started as a maid in a rather, rather fine <span class="BUILDING">household</span> of a Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I think, like my father, she was very eager to improve things, so she went to <span class="BUILDING">evening schools</span> and ended up being the secretary of a very important man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> and one day walking her little dachshund, she saw a rather handsome man, my father and that's how they got together and eventually ended, it ended up in marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  So you're describing two people who were very much self-made, certainly self-improving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Totally, totally, but the point that I am astonished when I read what my mother wrote, it's so impeccable and so well expressed that well, it must be an innate thing with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">She was a very unusual, unusual woman who didn't fit in this century at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">To her there were only flowers and beautiful things, you know she was extremely sensitive, neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I hear my father always complaining, why don't you leave the broom away, why don't you quit cleaning, but even the handles of the brooms had to be sanded, it was ridiculous, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But a lovely, lovely, lovely woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I assume, probably because she didn't ever receive much love, she wondered, she went overboard with love. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I remember she was 70, over 70, I'll tell you a nice thing about her, and she told me once, you know Walter, I wish I could have another baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">When she was 75, the newspaper, the leading newspaper of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> promoted a jogging contest, 30 kilometers, which is 18 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She registered and she was told, you're too old and she protested. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">After her fifth victory, at the age of 81, she had a special trophy from the Secretary of the Interior, true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Could you tell us her full name, her maiden name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Yeah, Henriette Paula Summerhowser(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  That's a great story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Tell us what it was like to have them as parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">What was it like growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Did they spend a lot of time with you, giving you instruction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Well my mother was a mother plus. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I sometimes wonder where she got all the knowledge, because we were exposed to, that 1s my brother and I, we were exposed to food, which is now whole food, or.. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Natural food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Natural food, yeah, and I had to drink carrot juice and lots of fruits and the butter had to be special butter and the eggs had to be from <span class="DLF">yard</span> , yard eggs, yard chickens who ran free and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Very little meat, and she said the fact that I survived is because she nursed me 18 months and my father was, he expected me to be the way he wanted me to be and I was exactly the opposite, so not getting any attention at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I tried to get attention in other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That led to a situation where, he would probably beat me up three times a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It came to the point where we didn't speak to each other, there was no communication, and I was not allowed to eat at the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So it was quite extreme. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I think 1f you had given me a gun when I was 11, I probably would have shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It took me many years and nowadays I miss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It took me many years to love him dearly, I hated him. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So, you know, when he looked for me, he wouldn't ask for my son, he would ask for, have you seen Walter Meyer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  How did he want you to be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Follow his footsteps, to do, obey, be first in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , just be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He kind of admired me, didn't show it much, because I was a top athlete and even the horrible things I did, he admired me for them, but he didn't openly agree to it and things started, probably he resented me and I don't think he liked very much the fact that I was born really. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Became a liability, and I wet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Well, that meant he had to get up during the night and oh, when he came I was already wet, or after he had come I wet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , so it started there and then I just didn't do the right things, I was late, I didn't -- whatever he expected me to do, I was the opposite of my brother, who looked like him, who did exactly what he expected of him, he was a kind of outstanding boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was the one who was always in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  So you were rebellious at first, within the family structure?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was probably born rebellious. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Yeah, within the family structure, yes, my brother would receive chocolate and he would probably have it for three weeks, but I ate it immediately and hated him for having some left. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I liked the <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , I should have been born in <span class="REGION">west Texas</span> on a big <span class="DLF">ranch</span> with animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was confined so. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Fortunately my father, for example, he thought maybe if he embarrassed me in public by putting the bed sheets <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like flags, that would make a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Well that upon the teasing. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Fortunately I was physically, I was in good shape, so anybody who would start teasing me, I didn't suffer much, because I would beat them up, so my physical status helped me in many ways to overcome this. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But it was not a pleasant situation and it was kind of balanced with the enormous amount of love that I recetved from my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  It's like it sounds like almost the two you know, very, really kind of stern and sometimes brutal father and a mother .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Yeah, except one time I was a little surprised, I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was already 12, 13, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you start <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at 10, you don't have <span class="BUILDING">Junior High School</span> and all of the -- and we had a teacher with one wooden foot and we call him the rhino, because when he came down the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , it was like an earthquake and he liked to slap boys, there was no co-education, all boys and you generally had two answers to a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">If you answered A, he would slap you, if you answered B, he would slap you. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I think I always in my life hated for somebody to touch me, except with a nice embrace or a kiss, and so I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I left a note, because I didn't talk to him, I left a note with my father, told him about the situation, that I was not going to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Well, he went, I understand, checked with others, and found out that I had told the truth, so he left me a note that said, next time he hits you, hit him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I told everybody in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> my father told me to hit him back, so I became an instant hero and a double hero after it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My God, everybody was in expect, expectation and sure enough, the next day he hit me and I hit him back and ran and ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So there was a special conference and my father was called and I think he wanted to have the privilege of being the only one to hit me and the teacher actually was moved to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Did your father support you , In that <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Well, I was not, I was not in the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was called and obviously he explained it, that he actually had told me to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  What did they teach you about being a German, and about community life, politics and
ANSWER:  I looked the other day at some of the biology and physic books and some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  That you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  That I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">When you -- I'm speaking now about '41, the war had started already. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">In history of course you would see —__ 1n other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> of the world, you would see a education of everything, German and Germanic, which made you believe that we were a superior race. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We learned, in an intellectual way, to recognize Jews and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Jews were then regarded as a race, rather than a religion, were inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was explained very thoroughly that even statements made by and other prominent Jews who spoke negatively about their , So to speak, so there was justification. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The history of the Jews as nomads and , you learned to appreciate that Jews were inferior or no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Maybe similar to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where you learn that blacks are there to shine your shoes, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I had a little problem understanding that, because there are so many instances in my life where there are confusion, simply because I was born at a time where I played with Jewish children, I went to their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I loved to go to their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because their mothers had goodies, nice cookies and they had better toys than I had, but then, there was nothing wrong with them and suddenly they kind of became outcast and they disappeared and had David stars on their clothes and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That was a little confusing to me, and I became, probably because I liked the attention, I became an altar boy, and I asked the priest one day, I said, why is all this anti-Jewish sentiment and Jesus was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I says it says INRI, that means Jesus was_____ King of the Jews, he was a Jew and the answer then was, you are not supposed to ask these questions, and to express doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Doubt is not a very Christian thing to do, just accept things as they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And he called me son and I hated him because I knew he couldn't have a son and he called me son, I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So one day, I was just so mad I just, see the big book that you have, I just threw it on the <span class="DLF">altar steps</span> and ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I didn't go back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But that was very controversial issue with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Then of course we came to, when I was rather young, I was 12 years old, we came to . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">1 don't know how many times I tried to, to, to start a fire in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">There was a gorgeous <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , but so massively built out of, I think sandstone, that you couldn't even start a fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So I don't know how many times they tried to burn it, and then I looked and I saw people throwing through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I said, why do they do this to poor people and so on, it just didn't make any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Who was throwing the ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  The SA and SS, after a member of the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> in was killed by, I understand by a Jew, the Crystal night started and they just cleaned out, and told the Jews to leave because we want to have a <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a racially pure <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they were asked to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I remember that very vividly, it was like an uncontrolled revolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The mob took over, and it seems whenever there are revolutions, many people look for an opportunity to do ridiculous, nasty, violent things. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It seems to be part of the German element, especially those who have been oppressed for some years, all of this is a golden opportunity to just go without asking why, they just go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Think about that night and when did you realize something funny was going on, did you hear sounds, did you smell the fire, did you run out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  As I remember it, we used to have, well every German family was supposed to have a little radio, it was called a . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The Volkes receiver, like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was the Volkes receiver, which was the standard model, if you had more money, you bought a more sophisticated one, but the allowed you to listen to the news, to Hitler and so on . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But there were many who did not have the money to buy one, so there were large radios on public squares, people stood around and listened, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And so the big news was that a Jew had killed a member of the diplomatic corps and of course I didn't know the name, , that came later on, but it was called the , because of all the Crystal that was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then when I went through the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you could see out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> came things, I mean it was -- police was there and move on while they threw things out, it was a nightmare, and that went over throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , especially in those areas where Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And Jews as a whole had certain areas of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they had their locations and was Close to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> and the <span class="DLF">zoological garden</span> and there were quite a few Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  How did you parents react to that? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Did they try to get you to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , what were their reactions to the event even happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  No, I don't think we even discussed it, my mother asked questions like, asked my father, why do they do that, why are people like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Those are the questions that I remember and my father was very short-tempered with answer, like you know people are beasts and that would be the end of that conversation, so it was not discussed widely. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Discussions came a little later, after the war had started and my father would make clear that it would be impossible to win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He had been in World War One. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Especially when the Germans marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , he said that'll be the end, that's the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He had a very important position, because of his rather impeccable knowledge of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liedel(ph</span> ), which is in <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> , it's kind of the Pittsburgh of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , under German occupation, to become the liaison man and to see that things would run smoothly and he was in charge of about 750 <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , mostly iron and steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liedel(ph</span> ) was his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and he was one of the few who had never become a member of the National Socialist Party, because he just hated these men who suddenly appeared with brown shirts and swastikas who became functionary with the party, and in many cases people without any outstanding reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And I remember people coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we did not have too many visitors, but when he spoke, he really didn't care, he didn't give a damn, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But I heard people say, Paul, or Mr. Meyer, you shouldn't talk like that because you know what happens to those who talk to much, ah, he just shook it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Anyway, he was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and I had a letter the other day, the French government wants to decorate him posthumously for all the things he has done for the French during his stay in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I'm in many ways, I don't know whether I hate to recognize it, but I'm in many ways exactly like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So that's the genetic secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Back to your question, that is what I remember, glass, broken things everywhere, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> being thrown out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , to the point where it was so wild that you, you tried to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you tried to go away, it looked a little dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  What was the mood among you and your friends or other families? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Okay, that there's this horror going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , things are being broken and thrown, people don't really understand it, there's not a lot of discussion going on at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about it, what was the mood? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Did you know what was coming ? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Did it surprise you that it happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  I think my generation, we were a little too young to understand, but you would hear those who would make remarks like, all this good stuff, just destroying it, makes no sense and you would hear others say, they asked for it, they asked for it, they had it coming, suits them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So you had these two parties, and then others who had learned to shut up, to say nothing, and that party was probably the strongest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Another party would say, they know what they're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Don't forget the, well <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's a very young country is <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but let's say Germanic people, for endless generations, have obeyed government, faithfully, stupidly, without asking questions, and when you read the paper, or you just read the paper in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then this is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Nobody would say ah they lie, papers don't tell the truth, this was the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So there was no open rejection, resistance, uproar, , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But you have to understand that by that time Jewish propaganda in newspapers, films, radio, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , etcetera had already come to a high point and, but this was not the first time in German history that anti-Jewish feelings had been prevalent, in the middle ages for example, so this was just one repetition, so the Jews had always been somewhat outcast, somewhat , kind of unwanted minority, so even I remembered when I went through my father's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> to take care of the cows, which I liked, because I never had to brush my teeth or wash my face, so that I was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I still love to go there today. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I remember Jews coming up to buy cattle, or to advance money to the farmers, with the understanding they would, they would buy the _ from them the next year and so, and they looked a little different and well you wouldn't refer to them as Mr. Mason or Mr. Sauder, you'd say, did you see the Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I mean this was it, 1t was different, and I try to make analogies of like here and see that nigger? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It was an identification ;
QUESTION:  had that and yet you were questioning as a child, you were asking the priest, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a questionnaire, so to speak, or questioner, I like to ask questions to the point where somebody would, quit asking so many questions, I heard this all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It didn't make any sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But that doesn't hold true for everybody else, many people don't ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So I go, to <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> , I say why 1s it called <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> , people, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Well ask until I finally find somebody, <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> means wealth of fish, ah, that's , SO I like to ask questions and I remember the time my argument was with the priest, why I asked, it just occurred to me that it didn't make too much sense, but it was not a common thing, to ask questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Did you have discussions with friends of yours that were Jewish, do you remember them being concerned, or their parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  No, because when it came to the persecution, that was when they disappeared and there was no argument any more, as a matter of fact, you were not allowed to associate with them, they were not allowed to come to your <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy, they were not allowed to attend your <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , it was suddenly a war and that was it, so you couldn't argue with them, and say what happened to you, what happened to your father and so on, you couldn't, that was it, you did not know that they were moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You later on heard ; which meant <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , , you heard that, but that was more or less like hearing about, if you don't behave, you're going to end up ina , you're going to end up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , but definitely there was nothing known about gassing people, mass executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">was a word like, oh maybe an exaggeration would be if you don't behave, you're going to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric chair</span> , something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  It was used casually?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  It was used casually, yes, it was used casually. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Nobody knew, when I say nobody I mean the masses didn't know that there were as many, and I'm talking now about the early 40's, as many as there were, and nobody knew what happened in them, because the ones that were <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , couldn't talk, so you knew that it was bad, mass killing, no you didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Help us understand this, at one point you're going to the <span class="BUILDING">friends house</span> , that they have great bon bons, they have great toys and then there's a shift, you don't go to their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> any more and then there's another shift and maybe these kids aren't even here any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So how did that unfold in your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Perhaps there's a trend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Well, I should have explained that one of my good friends for example, his name was Winter and they had an <span class="BUILDING">office supply store</span> , and he was Jewish or half Jewish, I think he was half Jewish and it's not like all the Jews or half Jews disappeared like overnight, there was a gradual process. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Don't forget some of them went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , others said Hitler's not going to last, so we're going to stick it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So they didn't quite disappear, but since they were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you ask me an interesting question, I don't know whether I asked myself consciously the question, where are they now, I think maybe I assumed that they went to other <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> , maybe to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> or something like that, so it is not as shocking as you think it was, it was kind of a gradual process and maybe I said I wonder where they are, but you kind of assumed that they went to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or that they, maybe a greater assumption was that they probably went to, to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to somewhere, but I mean it was not known that -- you see in 38 they were asked to leave, and many did. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And so I think that many, I don't even know that I remember that, but I assume in 38 when that happened, I was 12 years old, that was just they're unwanted here and they're leaving, and that was about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Your friend, I don't know if you were going to tell a story about the friend _—_—?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Yeah, what surprised me, that he lasted as far as I know, throughout the war there, and we had a, I never met his parents, we had a Jewish boy, but I am talking now about 43 and he played with us, his name was Brendon Brook(ph) and I discussed it when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with a friend of mine, he said remember Brandon Brook(ph), I said yes, whatever happened to him, I don't know, but we knew he was Jewish, I don't know what happened to his parents, but he played with us and we used to hide them, hide him. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">He stayed three days with me, we put him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , then he stayed with my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We didn't want anything to happen to him, because we liked him, we always, he was a buddy, understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And whatever happened to him I don't know, because I was arrested, I was gone, so whatever happened to him, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Did your parents know you were hiding him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  I don't know because my father was, I was pretty much independent at the time because my father was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and my mother, she asked me questions, where you going tonight, oh you ask too many question, I'll be back soon or something like that was the answer you see, so I was pretty much I had my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and I was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I lived more, more outside that in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  But there was a sense that this, your friend needed to be hidden, hidden from view?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Oh, hidden from the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Oh, there was no question about it, we knew, we knew that they were picked up and sent away and assumed, not only did we, it was not so much because he was Jewish, if we had been friends with Chinese, we would have done the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It was kind of an entire authoritarian thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We would not allow the police to pick him up, he's a good kid, so let's hide him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  Do you have a first memory of being aware of the Nazi's in uniform, seeing the swastika?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think I was maybe eight or nine years old, where I saw for the first time, brown shirts and I saw a man who was frequently drunk and would abuse his family and nobody liked him very much, he became somewhat of a lieutenant or something like that with the SA and the first remarks of my father, saying something like, we don't got the kind of pigs that they recruit, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He was very negative towards them, simply because the SA and later SS, or the National Socialist Party, a party affiliation that sort of everything was Nazified, so to speak, you saw too many people who were not very qualified men, became suddenly leaders within that movement and that is what my father didn't like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  So the messages you were getting from your father were very skeptical of the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  It seemed to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But that doesn't mean that it had much influence on me, first of all I didn't agree with them and secondly I was tough enough to find out things for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But you must turn the page a little bit and see the part that I enjoyed and that was, first I was the , the young people, 10 to 14, that was the evolution from Boy Scouts, to the Hitler youth, which was a small step, really, even the uniform looked somewhat alike and I had been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for a year, and there was part of the Boy Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So the Hitler youth was 10 to 14, because of the was 10 to 14 and the Hitler youths, the HJ, Hitler youth 14 through 18 and the same existed for , the young girls and the BDM, BDM. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">BDM means , the association of German girls, so you had the male and the female version, but that was like going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , that was like having fun, that was like not having to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , so that was a pleasant thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I was a drummer in the , and you have to do a lot of marching, a lot of singing, a lot of playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">That did not have an ill effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Hitler youth, well first of all, 1t was obligatory, secondly, I became pretty much a star swimmer and it used to be, to make an analogy, aquatic club of Washington competing against the aquatic group of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">became , section six, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , competing with , section seven, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and it went then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and then terminated in the Youth Championship of the of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So you swam for the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The Hitler youths were then divided like the armed forces to infantry, , Calvary, navy and as aswimmer of course hadto __ the navy and I was trained and had become an underwater demolition expert, or a frogman, okay, which was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">What I didn't like, maybe that would be in front of my father, it's hard to say when you become older, what made you tick and why did you do this and so on, but I was pretty much a king on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">If something had to be done, like stealing apples or whatever, they would call me. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And I saw guys that I considered sissies and weaklings, they suddenly got a star, they became lieutenant, and I had to salute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Well I was not about to do anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">That brought about the first resentment, that's how it started all. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And there were others who kind of felt the same way I did, that prompted me to start a little movement, which in reality, after the war, it was called a political movement, but at the , It was nothing but a gag. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Not war and not love. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We were much too young to have ideological conviction. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We just didn't like these crummy guys whom we didn't see as young men, but sissies and no good for nothings and so on, that they became leaders and they told us what to do and they forced us to salute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So they brought upon this entire sentiment and it seems everything we did was negative, we enjoyed it even more. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We used to put condoms on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , on the little reflector. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We used to deflate the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , steal the saddle. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We did everything that would be, that would bring them physically and mental harm of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Then I think I went a little too far, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Yeah, I'm going to pull back actually, just get some more detail on some...
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Actually, I'm going to go pretty far back with you, because you mentioned something. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">What- maybe I won't do that, I think I'll wait on that one and I'll just have it for you later, details here. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">When you joined the , was that voluntary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Hmm-mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  The same with the Hitler youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Let me, let me, let me justify, if you had a son who had flat feet, or he had something that prevented him, then you would be excused, okay, but as long as you were a somewhat perfect specimen, yes you had to go.</span></p>

QUESTION:  I wanted to touch a little more deeply on religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">If you could just tell us how you grew up and how important was the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And then it seems you made some personal choices also, as a young boy, about religious commitment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Religion was totally unimportant in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The Meyers were not the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> going family, much to the disappointment of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">My father, well let me explain in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you had to pay taxes, church taxes and so you have a little book, if you don't pay for September, then they write you a little note and if you still don't pay, then you cease to be a member, so it's very easy not to be a member any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">My father decided that he did not like all the hocus pocus and he didn't, he was a little disappointed that the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> did not do enough or presented no resistance at all to what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">As a matter of fact they seemed to be very much in favor of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So he quit paying and he became a former member. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">My mother hardly ever went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , but not because she didn't believe in God, or she was not a Christian, but there was too much work to do athome. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Took them __ take care of the kids and so on, especially the way she worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Why did I go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , well, I became not only an altar boy, but I became a prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">That means I had to read and then the whole people joined me, so that means they gave me acquisition of some category, became a star, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That was quite a bit of attention, which suited me fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Besides they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ping pong table</span> there in the <span class="BUILDING">parish house</span> , and they always had cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So those were the attractive parts and at one time they had a priest whom I liked very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He was a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But you, when you ask me questions, you have to also understand that I moved around a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I was not always at the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the same environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And when the environment changed, I even, believe it or not, sometimes thought of myself as not being a good boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I thought maybe I should do a little something to get better grades, or getting better -- but my gypsy blood didn't permit me to do that for too long a period of time, but there were moments that I kind of recognized that my behavior was sickening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  What do you mean by that? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">What were you doing that was so bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Well, maybe the question should be, what did you do that was good? </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I'll give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">When things didn't work too well, and there were eventually too many complaints from my mother, and my father was already gone, I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munhan(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> was in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of four or five story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the upper part was the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of the director, he lived there with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I lived with a boy whose father was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Well-to-do family, the boy always had a little money, so we got along fine, and the food we got there was quite poor, and yet you could smell, <span class="BUILDING">German houses</span> don't have ventilation systems like you have in modern structures, so you generally know whether somebody is cooking a roast a block away. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So the director ate rather well, and one day, it was before Easter, or, I think it was before Easter, or around Easter time, he and his family had a baking contest of some sort, I mean they cooked cookies forever and the smell penetrated the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The director went out in the evening to some theater function, I said this 1s it, so I broke in and distributed the cookies throughout the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Of course everybody was happy with me, but I knew that somebody would sing once they asked who did, somebody would say I did it, so I told my companion, my buddy, let's get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , so we put sheets together, it was about 10:30 in the evening, and climbed out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I asked him to give me a little money, he did and I said, well let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We put the sheets in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> and then he stopped and said, I won't go, my father is going to kill me, no, no, no, so he went into the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , to wait for the director to come and I took off and I joined then with a girl I had met and that's a little story I don't know whether you want to know about it, but I met her playing hit ball, which is kind of a baseball and we had eye contact and eventually I saw a little more of her and she came to every game and I tried to sneak out and talk to her a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Well, I went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she had a little <span class="DLF">garden</span> and I threw a little stone at her <span class="DLF">window</span> , she came out and we went and checked into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I wanted her to go with me, just let's go and I knew that the police would come, the police would come to every <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> to check who was living there and so on and so we took two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And the police came to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , police, I said look, and I had told her what to say, look my cousin, we went to a party and we have to go, we have to leave early, why don't you let her sleep and so on, so they left her alone, but after that, she joined me and I took her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the morning, I explained to her parents we'd been to a party, there was no telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Very few people had telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And they understood, they knew that she was a good girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So I didn't have enough money to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I thought well, since I was rather unusual I felt, well it would be a hell of a lot of fun to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I went down and convinced the captain to take me along, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So I went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , which is most unusual, but it was quite an event and I first met with the guys, they were happy to see me again, I told them what happened and my father was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> already, so I remember my mother looking at me and saying, why are you so different? </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Why don't you give us nothing but problems? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But I would find a way to say, but you love me, don't you, things like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">What is your father going to say? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Oh, you don't have to tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So, mailmen had disappeared, they were 1n the army, so we had mailwomen and I had developed a little relationship with the mailwoman, who taught me a little about sex and I told her, any mail that comes for me, give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">A letter came from Elsie, that was the girl I had left and I read, I said oh my God, put the letter in my pocket, the letter said, I'm pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So I didn't quite know what to do, she needed help, but my father had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that day or a day earlier and my mother thought it was time to change , So they took everything out of the pocket and there was the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So my father woke me up, did you sleep with the girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Yes, sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">If you're old enough to sleep with a girl, you're old enough to become a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And my mother, I see her go to pieces, Paul, he's not even 13, how can you say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Well, I tried selling things, toys I had, things of value, sent to the girl, who had an abortion by some kind of alley doctor and it ran into complications, my father finally intervened and , but those are the things, so it's not only like I beat somebody up, or built a fire somewhere, I mean it was just one incident after another, so I can't blame my father too much, except that with love he would have done so much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">That means, what I'm trying to tell you is that there were different environments, so I'm now going back to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which I attended earlier, so something new had to be created, there was a new beginning again, you understand, and that was about the time of the Hitler youth, because the Hitler youth returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The Hitler youth, I believe in 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Did you want to join Hitler youth, or you knew you had to, did you say uck?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">There was absolutely no...
QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was fine, yeah it was fine because there was nothing really negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It meant you had to go to service, I think twice a week, generally on Sundays, and the, I have to tell you another thing about another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , generally on Sundays and it was instructional and that it, you learned the Morse alphabet, or you learned the flags, in the navy, you know, a, b, c, d, x and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It was a pre-military thing, very physical education centric and then of course I wanted to swim and the only way you could swim was by being a member. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Without being a member I couldn't even swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So I was representing now, the Hitler youth of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Even though I belonged to a swim club, the swim club went into the background and I swam for the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But I was in , which meant I was about 11, I think and the truth is I don't know exactly where they were , but a new kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had called the <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I hate to make that kind of analogy, but it was about as select as the <span class="BUILDING">Air Force Academy</span> , something of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">A one directional school, and I was chosen to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler school</span> , because I had, my intelligence level was really high, physically I was in top condition and no Jewish blood for at least five generations, so I was a top candidate. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">That was quite an honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But before going to the <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler school</span> , I was sent, with a group of other candidates to a kind of pre-screening school, where there were certain tests, physical and mental tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I was there for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">When my father heard about that, he said forget it, it's out, you're not going to any, that kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And I hated him for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And he explained then, with a very few words, saying things like today you won't understand, one day you will thank me for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So I didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But I was chosen for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk to him about why he didn't want you to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  No, it was the other way around, he told me, you now understand why I resented, yes I said, I do and I appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So he was in many ways very far-sighted and very, very realistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  You disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  I was very disappointed at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I was very disappointed at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I was also, there were many disappointments one after the other, when I was even younger I wanted to go to the movies, well you can't go to the movies, there's no money for a movie, it was a ridiculous waste of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> for a lady who gave me five cents and did something for somebody else and delivered hot bread in the morning, buns in the morning at six o'clock to make a little money so I could go to the movies and have a little money to play around, I was never with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I remember the first, well the movies that you saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time, we'd see a wild west film, then definitely, what's the little child? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Shirley Temple. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Shirley Temple and Nelson Eddy(ph), Jeannette McDonald, things. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The funny thing is, I always saw Andy Devine, remember him, the one with the funny voice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  Hmm-mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I ended up doing a portrait of Andy Devine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">just an incredible man, I saw as a child, I meet him now in person, only I didn't meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">a thing, because the big event. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I think I was 10 or 11, 11 maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I, for some reason, I could write like an adult, a weird thing, but I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So I would make money by writing excuses for other students. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">My son could not attend today because he had fever, so on and so on, and they would give me one mark or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But I was very, very good with a pencil. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">With my fountain penI _ of my grandfather, and my teacher would not believe that I had done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They realized that I had done it, I was sent to the Academy of Fine Arts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , which 1s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> and there are a few <span class="BUILDING">academies</span> with big names, and I was there, I went there for a period of time, maybe three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">All these weird, weird professors and teachers, I don't know, a strange environment, kind of hippyish and nude models. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But I learned quite a bit, so this was another kind of filler in my life, to be exposed to all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  you describe you father, he basically, is this a fair assessment, he was anti- Nazi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Yeah, he was very, very anti-Nazi, very much in favor of the underdog, very much in favor of the sufferer. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">My father would pick up people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you hungry? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And my mother would say, how can you ask total strangers to come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Shut up, feed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And the guy would be someone educated, say, no I have enough, no you don't have enough, eat another plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">This is how my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So there was a golden heart, within a concrete shell. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He was a very good man, and well _ later, when he saw me again, when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Anyway, so, yeah, he was very, very anti-Nazi, anti-authoritarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">He was, in many ways like me, or I am in many ways like him, except that we didn't understand each other, because I was too much of a, I don't know, if you got into a psychological analysis, maybe he envied me. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Maybe he wanted to be like me, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  Did you feel any conflict, being a part of the Hitler youth, at first, when you first were a part of it, you were embracing it when you were real young. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Did your father say don't go there, don't do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  No, no he didn't, he didn't do that because the Hitler youth was really not an aggressive anti- anything thing, was a youth movement in which certainly there was a certain amount of indoctrination, but that part of indoctrination you had in every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you had all over, similar to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , so that there, that did not mean much, besides, I have to emphasize that my father spent very little time, he was already in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Of course, he went to Belgtum when he was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so the greatest part of the war, he was not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  He didn't really know exactly what you were doing ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Tell us a bit about the indoctrination, what did it mean when you were required to join the Hitler youth? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">On your birthday did you have to go down and register and then you were expected to make at these meetings? </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Did they give you a uniform, what was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  The uniform you had to buy, also those who didn't have the money were given the uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Since everything is known pretty much like nowadays in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , about you, somebody knew, somebody knew about your birthday , so then you were asked to come, the Hitler youth was divided into, let's say the <span class="BUILDING">Northwest Headquarters</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">East headquarters</span> , <span class="BUILDING">south headquarters</span> , so each district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a little headquarter and you would then report to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And then you would be to be at what time, and when the service would be and when he would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You would march, you would learn songs, you would go camping and you would participate in social things like going through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , cashing money for the winter aid program. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">That means those who were a little cold, in <span class="REGION">northeastern Germany</span> , they helped them with clothing and ; you would have a little box and cash money. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">You would help, on some corners they had what they called the , where they made soup for something like a nickel, you would get a bowl of soup, good soup, good soup and you would help there by firing the cannon, or by cashing the money or something like that, you would help to collect raw material that was used for the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Steel, aluminum, things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Then you would go through the service to learn the specialty of your particular <span class="REGION">section</span> , like in the Navy, you would learn one thing, artillery, you would learn another thing, aviation, you would learn, so in that sense it was a pre-military organization, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They wanted you to be in superb conditions once you reached 17 or 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">When I was 17, right offhand I think three or four weeks after I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Four weeks, three weeks before I had written a letter, forging my father's language, signature, asking for admittance to the navy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilhelmshaven</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and three weeks or four weeks after I was arrested, orders came for me to go, of course then it was too late, otherwise I would have joined the navy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  So you, as a young man say, 13, 14, 15, you were beginning to see yourself fighting in the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  No question of it, no question of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And really with some enthusiasm, because 1f meant adventures, 1t meant seeing things, 1t meant growing up fast, it meant proving that you were a hero, it meant all kinds of things that were appealing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Which some of your stories already show, I mean, you liked adventure, you were an adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Oh, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The greater the danger, the more I was for tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  Did you, what other sense did you have about the purpose of the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">How did you make sense of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  I don't believe that at that time I asked that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I know what I read and heard eight hours a day, left some sort of explanation within me, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was not the aggressor, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was the victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The Poles had killed a number of poor Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Took me a long time to read the true story, but this is what I was exposed to, the Germans than retaliated, so there was a justification. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Then you learn about, we going a little ahead, but as I remember it, you see one victory after the other, no problem going through, taking <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , no problem <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> said Hitler, they were the happiest people in the world to be, to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they called <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the , being to reenter and so no opposition at all, you would roar. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I think once in awhile I said how horrible it must be to be bombed or torpedoed and then die. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Yeah, I thought, and my mother frequently said, those poor mothers when they receive notice, but then there would be a voice from someone, my father, so and so, well, that's war, that's war. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You kind of got used to it, and then it didn't take very long really before you were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Kind of every night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  How old were you when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  15.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  What was the first one like, the first experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  You were, oh I remember my mother, probably I was 10 years old when my mother was trained against gas attacks to wear a mask and all this, so in retrospect, it's rather interesting to realize that that happened that early already, but you didn't see it as a threat of war, you saw it more or less as a good exercise to be prepared if ever, you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I remember how I laughed as a kid when I saw her with the mask. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It was kind of a brutal thing to look at. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Well, you heard, as I told you before, over radio, newspaper and so on, that attacks were expected, aerial attacks had taken place and of course always would be the enemy had no respect for <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> or <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> or anything, they would gladly bomb, therefore you had to be prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Bunkers had been built, either above ground of solid concrete, or below ground, and the siren, when the siren up and down, that meant they're coming, one tone meant they've gone, then you could get out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , see? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So you kind of prepared that and well the first attacks, maybe they were a little bit too far from you, so you didn't worry too much, but by 19, by the end of 42, the beginning of 43, a great part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> was pretty bombed and of course eventually was bombed about 75% of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  No, not every, we lived in the did not suffer much, when you say the did not suffer much, I mean you saw destruction maybe a mile from here, okay, and all suffered a little bit but speak about total destruction or just some <span class="DLF">shrapnels</span> , of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> not only suffered air attack, but also the Americans eventually came across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> so that you had artillery, so you had from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Anyway, so you, you get used to it and see suddenly a bunch of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that look like being under construction, but they were destroyed, you see only some <span class="DLF">walls</span> standing and you hear cruel things like one family decided not to go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and they were found in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> on the next <span class="DLF">block</span> , you feel these tremendous deprivations and so you then develop, oh a small minority will say we asked for it, the majority will say, will display a tremendous amount of anger, would say oh, let's help to kill the enemy, so there are very few people, in reality who said, well really, we begun it. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We kind of, it was felt that we were right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Did you? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">How did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I don't, I don't really know and I don't really, I don't think that any of my comrades, my friends, we discussed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I believe strongly that we considered this a temporary situation, after all, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would win, therefore we didn't take it very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Well, they throw a few bombs, but we're going to get them eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I don't remember there's, as a intelligent conversation, but I believe that was the thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  You're talking about that you would go to the service, was it actually when you were with the Hitler youth, was there some sort of ceremony once a week, you mentioned singing songs, what was the songs about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Oh, the songs were typical marching songs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The words were very nationalistic, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Tomorrow we have <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , today we have <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , tomorrow the whole world, things of that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It was a place on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> where we had all the tools of instruction, the flags and the Morse alphabet and the pictures and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It was a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> , right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was very far from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so I had to go a long way, and the truth is I didn't go there very often simply because swimming meets, championships were generally on the weekends, so every Sunday I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krefeld</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> , and every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German city</span> and finally went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> or for the German youth championship, so I was gone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But during the week I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and on the weekends, we generally had a meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So in the beginning, before I swam competitively, I went through the service a few times, but it was not that I went there for three years in a row.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  We had meetings generally at least , generally at a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> on <span class="DLF">Kings Avenue</span> , which 1s, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there are a number of <span class="DLF">streets</span> which are well known like <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , well <span class="DLF">Kings Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , it's one of the best known <span class="DLF">Avenues</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It's gorgeous white and has a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in the middle and all chestnut <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Well there was a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> and on the back of the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> was a <span class="INT_SPACE">pool room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We used to play pool and we had little meetings there and one would say, we have a new member and we would ask him questions, test him, and why do you like to join us and you know, whether they have some assurance, and then we put, what are we going to do next and maybe one would say, you know, the Hitler youths, they all stored their equipment at such and such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , let's make it disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Okay, when are we going to meet, such and such a time, and that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It became, it came to the point where we became enemies and people began to look for us because we went a little too drastic, you know we started by deflating the tires, then we made the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> disappear, so it came to the point where too many complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Well, I went to see my French friends and I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> over to the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> and the alarm went off. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And so we waited for the siren, and it eventually went up, and we knew by the shaking that a bomb had dropped rather close by, so we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Everything is dark of course, I mean all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I found that, we found, because there was another guy with me, that, oh I was on foot because my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> had disappeared, I left 1t <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , 1t was gone and I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I found, we found a <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> , totally destroyed and the shoes were everywhere, so I said come on, let's pick up shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Put the shoes in my coat, 1t was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Then we walked towards the main square where there were a few lights where the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was, and I said let's see what we have, I looked and I had only left shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I said what are we going to do and a lady came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and I said, do you want these shoes and she, she was a little confused and it became more of a discussion, trying to tell her to come on take the shoes and . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Well there was a policeman close by, said what's going on here, and as he approached us I started running and he screamed, hold him, hold him, for maybe six, seven, eight blocks down the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Somebody opened his arms like a bear and held me and from there I went to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And the one who tried to arrest me showed up and he whipped me very nicely, making clear that you shouldn't escape from a German police officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  That's why you understood he hit you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  When we started, it was about one o'clock in the morning I think, a few questions were asked, name, telephone call to this, this and that and they decided to take me to the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I wrote about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">If you want me to read about it, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  Yeah, would you read a couple ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  I was in the main <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> , I had already been caned for fleeing the scene earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">The banging from the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> becoming louder. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">An SS officer was coming to fetch me and the sound of his boots was ricocheting down the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> and into the little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I was waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It was an impressive sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">At parades, the SS would march down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , dozens of them clicking their metal studded heels against the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">They love to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">My childhood memories of the glory of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> are marked with the thunderous rhythm of a hundred boot heels and loud, boisterous singing of soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And so did the boots of the SS elicit quite a different connotation. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Why did you take the shoes? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Do you realize the penalty for looting is death? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I'd been walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after an air raid and had helped myself to some shoes that I had found scattered around. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">From there I spent maybe two hours, questions and questions and.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  How old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  16. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I would have been, yeah, my birthday was in May, this was in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And then came questions, the first man sit in front of me and stared coldly into my eyes, while the second relentlessly beckoned forward across the back of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And where were you before the air raid, he asked, the tone in his voice suggested that he already knew the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Some friends, we were socializing. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Liar, he shouted, you were with a group of boys planning subversive activities against the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We know about your involvement in the Edelweiss , and we know you sympathize with the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I wanted to argue, tell the officer that he had no right to accuse me of such things. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Unfortunately what he'd said had been true. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">From there I went, I was transferred to Gestapo headquarters, Gestapo means secret state police. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And that was quite a terror, because I was beaten, kicked and I had to clean my own blood and my own vomit and then I was called before a man, I was asked to undress, and one looked at my penis, and he looked at the other and said, he's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I should explain that there are men who are born almost circumcised and I'm one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Matter of fact when I was oh, I guess 11, I began to masturbate and that caused a little problem, it caused pain and like in most cases, like circumcision of the Jews, they just stretch the foreskin and then cut it, so it kind of rolls back and the whole head of the penis is exposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">In my case the skin was glued to the head, so I had to go to the doctor with my father and I remember the doctor looking at me, what have you been doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I played innocent, nothing face and then he said, well we have to maybe had long needle and my father said, I remember it well, I give you marks if you don't scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I didn't scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So he loosened the skin, but anyway I looked circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So then they called a specialist, a race, a race expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">He looked at me, he turned me, he looked at my nose and my eyes, he turned me around, I felt like a prize bull, and very convincing, said, ah, he's not Jewish, forget that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I could hardly move, I was so beaten and then I was transferred from there, early in the morning to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that was called ; which means, pre-trial prison. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Course that didn't mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I mean you stayed there as long as they decided that you should stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I remember <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because I used, there was the <span class="DLF">northern swimming pool</span> , we had to drive by the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> was known as the strasser(ph), <span class="BUILDING">street prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And among the guys we used to call it the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I never dreamed that I would become an inmate there. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But anyway, that's where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">concrete floor</span> and it was very much like taking an African lion and put him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I was a wild boy, I didn't belong into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span> , I belonged into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> , where I could go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So I suffered enormously and I dreamed day and night, how in the world I'm going to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So escape was foremost in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I started doing work there, sewing buttons, or different things, and the way it was, I remember the first time, there was only a large ceramic bowl and a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stand</span> , that was your <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , there was no running water and a ceramic giraffe? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Carafe? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Carafe, carafe with water, and then you had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that you would push up, that had to be made properly, there was an inspection every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was polished concrete. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lamp</span> that you could pull up or push it, pull down or push up, had a little, little lead balls in it, for weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And got up early and then there was lunch and dinner, mostly soup and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">First time I didn't quite know what to do so there was generally a guard with a privileged prisoner, would push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with the bowls of food, he would open, and then you have to stand there and donk, donk, give you the bread and then he would lock. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The first time, didn't know quite what to do, so I wasn't quite ready, so they locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> again, I had missed lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">In the morning they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you would have to get your big bowl, your sanitary bowl so to speak, and walk down the row and empty it, rinse it out and then you were allowed to do your business so that was the time you were able to exchange some words with fellow prisoners, although there was always the guys that shut up, but what are you here for, what's new and, but that did not teach you much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  What were the guards saying to you , how were they treating you, why were they saying you were there, because , why were they saying you were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Was anybody saying ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  They didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">You had no communication with the guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  What was your understanding of why you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  I had dealt with the enemy, with the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I was the head of the Edelweiss , and I had quote stolen shoes, which was even worse, I had, what do they call it, after disaster?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Looted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  I had looted. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So I knew I was guilty, there was no question about it, I just didn't think that I deserved that much for so little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  Was there any, did your parents know where you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  They were, yes, they checked and they were informed, that they, they were told that they could not visit me until, they had to wait until the trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  stop now. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  Before we go into more detail about your time in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , just want to return to the Edelweiss Pirates and ask you, what were you , what was the purpose of this group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  Oh, if you, well, forced to give you one word I would say anti-authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We are going into psychoanalysis here. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">It may be because I hated authority of a, I really did not hate authority of a benevolent man, but authority was always, in my life, somehow related to something bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">My father's authority meant beating me up, the principal authority, there was nothing positive about that, so the guys becoming leaders, telling me what to do, that was no good, so, anti-authority is probably the answer, coupled with lust for adventure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  So it wasn't per se that you were anti Hitler, or anti what was going on with the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  I was much too young to understand that, however, after the war, there were a few members of course who were in my group, they were kind of glorified as the ones who resisted Hitler, but . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">That's a wild story. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">No, it wasn't that, but it was interpreted as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I mean if I wanted to glorify my life, I would probably say at a very tender age, I resisted and fought against Hitler, but that would be a lie, so I was nothing but, as I told you before, it's like a gang, and like gangs fear, kind of resent other gangs and resent the police and resent authority, that's what I did, I resented authority, because to me, authority was negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  Well what , because some of the things you were doing were, 1n a positive way, part of Hitler's plan for young people, the swimming, maybe going to a special <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">You wanted to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  True, true, I was a, let me be a little sarcastic, I was a fine German specimen, as expected by the leaders of the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I just took the everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  How did you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Oh, I guess I was kind of a little cocky and proud about it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I was enormously healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I was strong and I would make bets for 50 cents to pick somebody up with my teeth, just picking up his belt, picking up with my, I did all kinds of crazy . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Very strong, very tough, very healthy, very yeah, and not dumb, so that combination 1s rare to find.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  I'm trying to place your family, your family, to get a sense of it, how any of the rest of , your father didn't respect the Nazis, and yet they sort of lived during the war, your father got some good jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You did and you didn't and so I'm trying to get a sense of you being...
ANSWER:  I think that's a little difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  , | don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  I think I should, I should say to you with all sincerity that there's nothing normal about my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">My father a very unusual man in every sense of the word, who spent little time with me when I was a child because he didn't particularly care for me and when I was a youngster he was away. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">My mother didn't fit in the picture, she was probably the most naive woman of the 20th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So we were quite unusual, and as my father was a self-made man, I definitely was self-made. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Even though I had a relatively good education, but life taught me much more and my traveling around the world, much more than my education in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I was well prepared, like every <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , like every <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So it was my free spirit, my resentment of authority, resenting anybody who told me you have to, which prompt me to say why and that got me in trouble automatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I sometimes ask teachers why and that was almost like a sin, you were not supposed to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So I was the one who asked and looked for explanations for all kinds of things, but that does not mean that at the tender age of 14 or 15, I wanted to have a, if there is such a thing, a logical explanation to the existence of Hitler, or to the Jewish question, so no, that's, I would have been a genius. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">That just would have been somewhat unnatural. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Would I ask, which I didn't understand why suddenly there was so much anti-Jewish feeling, then the explanation came, well because they have nothing to do but this and that, so they have taken over the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , they have taken over education, they are parasites, they are, they have white German girls, they have done this and this and that, and whether you believe all of that or not, but they're, it creates certain doubts, are they really bad? </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And as you grew up in this atmosphere, you don't ask questions like is that really all true? </span><span class="sentence" id="614">No, you accept it and it does not become a dispute within you as far as rationality is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  , was there some other group like yours in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> or in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Well in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , yes, I understand, I don't know this is true, but I think the Edelweiss Pirates, they began and some of the older ones actually had ideological ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">This 1s probably why some of the guys who met with me were later kind of glorified. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So they were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was some of the cradle of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But why do you join an, why do you join a gang? </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Because you're bored, because you don't like what goes on, in terms of some weirdos becoming lieutenants and captains and so on, and you want to have a little fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You get the attention that you don't get at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">That combination makes you do certain things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  So you had, on one <span class="NPIP">level</span> , you were this perfect specimen, as you said, healthy, incredibly strong , perfect German , everything to be a perfect Nazi, on the other hand, you have this questioning spirit, so you didn't quite fit in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  That is correct and that's why I had to suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You see, I have to tell myself now, that if I had behaved the way I was expected to behave, that I would have been killed in the navy, or I would have become an outstanding officer, and there's no question about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Of course that is all hypothetical, we don't know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But even in the navy I would have had problems, because I would have questioned the authority of my superior, unless he had treated me properly, in a justifiable way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Did it ever occur to you that you might have been asked to some way be involved in ofJews _?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  I have because it was not a navy thing to do, but killing, I have asked myself the question, I don't know the answer to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I had to kill a few times in my life, but self defense or whatever the circumstances were. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">At the time, at the age of 17, if I had been asked to kill, would I have, would I have asked questions why, I don't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I do not know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Let's go back to the point you were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , where we were about 10 minutes ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You've been in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for a few days now. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">getting used to it, are you able to have any contact with the ;
ANSWER:  Oh no, I never get used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I think 1t was the third day or the fourth day when a guard came and he was from my part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I assume that he disliked the fact that a member of his district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> embarrassed him in a certain way, so he came, opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I stood there, with my ceramic pot, he said, aha you, he said something like you are the embarrassment of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Shame on you and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">He said empty the pot in your <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">When I come back I want this clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">There was a little piece of, of course I had the water, a little piece of cloth, and I had to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was my first devastating experience so to speak after I'd been beaten up before. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Then I had a neighbor, I mean in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , he was from morning to evening, , 1 can still here it, that makes . , </span><span class="sentence" id="645">his voice was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And one of the prisoners told me that he was taken away after they had found him eating his own feces. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Whether he was a superb actor or he was insane, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But as I told you before, I was going to escape somehow and putting two by two together, I said well if I get sick, they have to take me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Not knowing that <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> have certain <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with bars for prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Anyway, said how am I going to get sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Well, I swallowed all of the lead pebbles in the lamp, but just as I swallowed them, they came out the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Then I found some rusty nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">It was rather difficult to swallow them, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And they came out without destroying any of my interior and finally I took a piece of the ceramic pot, from the edge, it was like a . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">That didn't do any harm either. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I forgot, as part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , I had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> and that was probably the most difficult thing I ever did in my life in terms of concentration. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I was going to fall on my head and just pass out, because I couldn't stand it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But every time I fell down, a kind of self-preservation, I put my hands up, until eventually, click. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I don't know how long I had passed out, but I had blood all over my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And life went on and nobody knew that it ever had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Then I said okay, I'm not going to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So I did not eat, I only drank water for 12 days and after 12 days, well we had, we had walking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , you know, five meter distance between each prisoner, walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I fell, I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Well rather than take me to the <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> or something, I was whipped half to death because it was evident that I had not eaten, that I purposely wanted to get sick, that was a no no. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So then I kind of gave up and said, well it won't work I have to wait for better opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">On April the 12th, April the 12th, 1943, I was taken to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">My trial, the state attorney I think they call it here, district attorney, state attorney, asked for the death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">My thought is, first time I saw my father and my mother, my mother couldn't control herself, so she was crying, and my father didn't quite know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">There were two attorneys, when he recommended the death penalty, I know they kind of jumped over and hugged my arm and said, that's not the last word. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Then kind of the judge and the state attorney and somebody else, some functionary, they kind of argued about whether it was looting, or whether it was theft. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The idea was that the two had different consequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And so they retired and when we came back, the judge decided, or had decided that it was, well before they'd had an argument and the state attorney that, I would call it theft, but this man, having had intimate contact with our enemy, and being the leader of the Edelweiss , having destroyed state goods, and state property, does not deserve any kind of consideration. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So when the judge came back and said, on the grounds of his outstanding involvement in athletism, and considering age and circumstances, I condemn you to one to four years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Let me explain, they said, with good conduct after one year, you may be relieved and join the armed forces, and if not, you will remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">That was it, and maybe a week later I was put in, what in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> slang is called, I was put on transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and at that time, I don't know how it is today, at that time, if you go let's say from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to <span class="REGION">California</span> , you would not go non-stop, you would maybe go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to maybe <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> and stay there a couple of days, three days in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and then join other prisoners and form another group that goes and you eventually come to <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So, first I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And there I was exposed to, it was a dirty <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , to bedbugs and lice and fleas and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And we all were set to move in the afternoon, all of us, the one side of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> had to move to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , because we could look into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and they used to chop heads, so they had executions in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , if you hear ding, ding, the little bell, so we weren't allowed to witness that, so we had to go the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Who would it be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Well, whoever was condemned to death, but instead of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric chair</span> they had beheading, which is really not an axe like so many people believe, but is an extremely sharp instrument that just go kind of straight through. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , I went to , that took two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">From there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> I was accompanied to where a few of the group, was a kind of <span class="BUILDING">security prison</span> for harsh criminals, I was condemned to one to three years in , which was a <span class="BUILDING">youth place</span> , or <span class="BUILDING">juvenile institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So left the handcuffs, harsh criminals and then I had one guard who went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I went and I looked at him for a few i 1 said this 1s my chance, but he could read me, he said, don't do anything foolish. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It's not that bad, this is better than being on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , so just behave and you'll get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So, I was always receptive to a kind word. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So I said I'm not going to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I think he said something like, you don't want me to shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , which is not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and it sounds a little funny when I say it's a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but it actually is. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">The front part, the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> was once a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">It had <span class="DLF">walls</span> about three feet wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And then from there you go this never-ending walk and then comes the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Of course most <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> are, there's a cross or there's a star so that from the center you can see all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And well, like in most <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> you receive your uniform and then you are to go to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and we had, three times a week we had <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was limited pretty much to German history and geography, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was very limited to the new <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so we talk about nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">There was more indoctrination there than anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And I assumed that they found out that I was probably at the intelligence level, more educated than any of the others, so I got a job as assistant to the buyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">We bought groceries and sent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was underway, it was a separate <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the way from the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I assure you that if I had been a good boy, I would have laughed at the war, I probably would have gained 100 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And the old guard, you know to me at the time, anything that was over 50 was pretty old, like my grandfather was an antique, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And anyway, he was so kind, so good, that I, I was not about to escape from him, because life was a little too good. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">But in one day, I had to do, I don't remember what, I had to do something, and the old <span class="BUILDING">convent building</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I remember, and I discovered in one of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , there were three bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You know, octagonal, they have eight comers or six corners, whatever, these bars, and one was loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">That was just too much temptation. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">My father was coming to visit and I wrote a little note. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I will be at such and such a time at that <span class="DLF">window</span> , please pick me up and I thought he's going to take me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and I'm going to disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I put it in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I think I needed a key or something and the note fell out of my pocket and the guard saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I never got to see my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I was taken to the warden, whom I called the spider because he looked like a spider. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">This immense <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I had to enter a circle, stand there. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">He had a big nose and his gold rimmed glasses sitting on his nose, said, well, well, mistake, mistake, mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I thought you were kind of a prisoner sample, an inspiration, and I thought this is probably one I will release soon, but I don't think you appreciate the treatment we gave you, so I have no choice, take him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Four weeks in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">That means, actually 28 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">28 days in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> without light, without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , 200 grams of bread, that makes two slices of bread a day and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And that was a little too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I don't know if it was then, no it was the next time. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Anyway, 28 went by and one day a guard brought me bread and hit me in the face and I never knew why. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">You have so much time to think and you become so desperate, you want to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">When they released me the guard said, okay, took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , I said, oh God, I want a hot shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">He turned the cold water on, thought I was going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And of course he hears those remarks, and it'll bring senses back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And then nobody treats you as if you have been on a very special diet for four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Life goes on, you have to work, and when you exercise, everybody starts picking on you then, because you are an outcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Okay, 50 pushups. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Count. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">You reach 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But you made a mistake, start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Then finally you just fall down and, get up, you're kicked and kicked again, until finally you try again. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Well, that went on for awhile, seemed like I had lost a considerable amount of weight, I said I just can't, I can't, I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So from where I walked I could see that there was a pole to pull up the cable over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It was a little foggy, kind of bad weather, I tried to stay behind, everybody went in and I ran, and up the pole, there were two cables and I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">One of guards saw me and shot me in the leg, so I fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Back to the spider. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So you have this dialog. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I have prisoners who make my life difficult, I like to have a peaceful existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I don't know why you're that way, but I think that the only way for you 1s to go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , it'll do you some good. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Something of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Another 28 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">By that time I thought, I picked flies, I picked anything and put it in the wound, so it would become infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I was too damn healthy for that, I mean my immune system was too damn strong for any bug. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But for a long time it stayed open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  Why did you put that bug in the <span class="DLF">wound</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  I thought I would have an infection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  And you the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  Cause an infection, dirty .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Cause an infection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  Cause an infection, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">That would take me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  So you kind of did it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  That didn't work, so I tried to find anything sharp and I tried to commit suicide, well I couldn't, I have scars here, all over when I look now. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Couldn't get the vein, just a little blood, so that didn't do any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Well and life goes on and 20 days go past, back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">This time a guard opened the, he ran the hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">You have no idea how much I loved the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And I think he was responsible for getting me a job to peel potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I remember maybe the first or second or third day. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">These are cooked potatoes, I cooked a bunch of potato peels and ate them because I was so hungry, and got so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Well, we were given an atlas from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> situation, every prisoner had an atlas, but each map had a back page which was blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And I don't know where I got a pencil, but I had a pencil, maybe I was given a pencil, and I did a drawing, a satire drawing of the warden. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Drew him as a spider. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Even an idiot would have recognized him. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And then I drew two or three guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">That was discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Back to the warden for a third time. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I'm back in the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Well at one time, at one time, I think the second time I was taken to the little , which means the little , not <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but a little <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span> kind of, where a nurse was, and I remember she told me, don't touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">She put some gauze around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Anyway, the spider then accused me of having destroyed state property. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Nobody can use this atlas any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I wanted so badly to kill him, so badly, and I could hardly stay in the circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I wanted to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Well, they take me away for the third 28 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">By that time, I was in bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But then many times when you, something happens and you see the warden, you join the others for your morning walk, they go, what happened, what happened, but you don't walk together, you walk one behind the other and well I had been called, this was the fourth time before the warden, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And he told me that on the basis of his experience with me, he felt that the best thing would be for me to join the armed forces, because there was nobody else who could handle me. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And whether he told me or I knew this would be the penal division, I would be first <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So when I walked with the guys, I said, well I said something like, he's trying to make me cannon food, and they all wanted to become soldiers badly, everybody wanted to get out, so he kind of reported what I had said, and I was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Did you say you don't want to become cannon food, or you refuse to join the armed forces, I think that's what . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Three, four, five days later, I was told to get ready, I was being transferred. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Where I am going? </span><span class="sentence" id="789"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> was known as a , aS a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and that was, that was bad news. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">But you have to understand that was, I was not in condition to discuss, to appreciate, to fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I think 1t was more of some relief to get out somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So I packed and I went on transport, and thankfully I met several other prisoners, and we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , _ <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , there was several <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , we were given some soup in aluminum bowls and water and bread, and there was, well I talked to one prisoner, we talked and thenI slept _, I was pretty weak and there was one who was Jewish and I tried to get away from a conversation, said oh, what are you, I'm Jewish also. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I said, oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">That was more or less the end, and I asked him what is the other guy doing, he looked funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">He's homosexual. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Oh, okay.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I don't know how long they , probably a week there or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I was called, well we had a pill every day, which means the big square, you see, dance, dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="830"><span class="BUILDING">Administration building</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and then in the middle, see and the ones that we had built, there was, we had <span class="DLF">masonry walls</span> and there was a section where the masonry were held in front with barbed wire, and it was loaded with electricity and I remember one guard, obviously didn't like one of the prisoners, took his head, we wore square hats, threw it away to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , or in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , go and pick it up and the prisoner refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I told you pick it up and he whipped him and by that time we drove off, so I don't know whether he ever went to pick it up, of course that would mean electrocution, or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">There was one guard who was very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">But I was old enough to appreciate he was gay. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Tried to stay away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">So when I heard there was a possibility to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span> to work in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , there I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So I went to a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , which was quite far away so we came only once a week to the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , change clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Some to receive mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I wasn't because my parents didn't know where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And also 1f you wanted to see the lager doctor, you had the choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Very few people did that because the rumor went if you're sick, they're going to liquidate you, so you didn't want to go to the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">On one of my trips I was asked to stay because another prisoner was ill and I was destined to clean the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> , and I had met the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And he was not the mean SOB, he was kind of, oh I don't know whether pleasant is the word, but he was not a sadistic idiot. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So I had made his acquaintance. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , which was divided, there was a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I never knew what they did with the rocks, but the different layers, the Russian prisoners were at the bottom, the French prisoners and we were on top and what you had, you had rails going up and on top of the privileged character, I had this big, big handle that would bring the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> 's a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , these had sides on them, get them down to the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , and pump, and empty one up and he would pick it up and then go the rail and there you had your little <span class="REGION">areas</span> , whatever <span class="REGION">area</span> was destined. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I had one prisoner who showed me how to cut a vein, because it's not, you can't be all day long, you have to fill 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> a day, that was the ; means quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And boy after a few days, my hand, oh my God, it was raw meat, it was huge, and after that of course 1f you have time and effort become like leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">There were two <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">The <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> had no sides so the guards could see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">The beginning there was two guards, but towards the end of '44, the younger guards disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">There were older ones and one was an invalid, no dogs, everything was a little lax. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">If you didn't have 12, you would get no food, so everybody worked like a little bee. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I remember once picking up a big rock, I remember years, years, years, years later I worked picking up some rocks, I lived on a rock that was big. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I all the way down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> to pick up some rocks and people asked me, where'd you learn all about these rocks? </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I said you wouldn't believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So I know a lot about rocks, but anyway, five o'clock whistle blew and marched, marched down, there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we slept, we were all passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">One thing I remember was one of the most disgusting experiences of my life, we had what we called the thunder beam, a long pole, it was lying over two barrels, it had to open the traps where we sat down to do our business one after the other, and then when it was full, you know they would and open another <span class="DLF">trench</span> actually, like a simplified <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">One of the guards had a prisoner cut the pole in half, so then when you sit on, of course it gave way with all the weight that we all ___—_—sain. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">There is no manure that 1s as bad as human manure. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Kitty cats are not as bad as human. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So that was horrible and then of course you came out of it, so they give you 10 minutes to clean up and the ones who didn't come out right again, he sent them back in, oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Anyway I worked there until January of '45, and one day I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to change clothes, I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">public rest room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I sat there in the normal position and I hear tick, tick, tick, tick. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Blood came out of my mouth and my nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I said that's weird, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I didn't get hurt or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But I lost so much blood that when I got up I passed out, and this guard, he part of a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So, the other prisoners kind of liked me, I was the youngest and one cleaned me up and cleaned my uniform so that nobody would get mad at me and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I began to hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Like needles stuck in my lungs and I told, I had a friend, a Russian prisoner, Ivan, I don't know whether that was his real name, but they called himIvan__. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">But don't ask for the doctor, it'll be your end. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Nobody has come back after they've seen the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But I had to know and I just couldn't stand it and so I asked for . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Lhad to see the doctor, the doctor for whom I'd cleaned before and I remember his name was Herr Mann(ph) and I said, this is what happened and I've been ____, I feel good and I can work and I just want to know, where's all the blood coming from and tapped my shoulders a little bit and looked at me and said, you have tuberculosis, you can't work, oh yes I can, oh yes I can, I can work, yes, oh please let me work, please let me work. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">You want to work?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">QUESTION:  When you tell this story about what's happening, it's hard to make it jive with the fact that you were a star athlete, perfect German heritage, I mean it sounds like at that point in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the Germans were not just persecuting Jews, but really anyone that had gotten in the way, or perceived to be in their way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">What were your thoughts on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Almost, almost automatically, when people ask me, how long have you been in the states, oh you were , were you in the army? </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">What'd you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Well, I don't volunteer all kinds of information, so I said, well actually I was a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Oh, what a Russian prisoner? </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">No, a German prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Well that of course 1s a little shocking, I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Oh, are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">That's the first thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Very few people know the concentrations were full of non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">That is not to say the majority, but yeah, quite a few, anybody who was not in agreement, or presented some sort of an obstacle to the Third Reich was put away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Either put away for good or put away in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of some sort, so I was one of those, so I was, I had fallen in disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">QUESTION:  Were there times when it was happening to you that it surprised you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">That you were being treated like that? ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">No, not really, maybe what, you see, the questions always implied that one preserved this rational thinking and that rational thinking goes away pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">You have all kinds of weird thoughts and you become mentally and physically a kind of wet rag, so to speak, you don't function well any more, you don't ask certain questions, in some instances you don't care any more, so you just go along and like a little robot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">So these rational questions, you may ask them in retrospect, but not so much at the time, and you look left and right, you see people being creative, I know some prisoners who were chewing bread and let the bread dry and made little chess figures because they were more eager in playing chess than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">There were others who would denounce anything in order to get a little reward from the SS or from the , So they would sell, probably even sell their own mothers for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">You have all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And we arrive in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so things don't change much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">QUESTION:  The story you tell about the farmer looking at you and asking your age and saying, how could they have done this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">How do you make sense of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">How the people who shot people in front of you, who kept sending you back to solitary confinement, how do you make sense of how they could have done that to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">ANSWER:  I don't know whether I can makes sense out of it, but I have been in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> and I see that people kill each other like flies, in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> in 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">People put bombs there, people put bombs on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Half a million people died in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , others are going to die maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Burundi</span> , so have things changed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">No they have not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Is there any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that can say we have never done anything wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I think the Germans are the only ones who did it in the most systematic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Others have done it in a more, I mean, the Spaniards have killed probably six million Indians and brought all kinds of diseases over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">The Americans killed all the Bison so Indians didn't have anything to eat and force marched them all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> from <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> and so on, so forth, not to speak about the Negroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And it's a disgusting chapter in the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Look at the French with the, look at the British, first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So I don't know what happens in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So if I were to accuse, I would accuse humanity, but I wouldn't pick one in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">There are people who think that Germans were born to be sadistic, that's not true at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">They're good ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">What has happened is a, I think I would be more interested in looking at those who could have prevented and didn't and one of those 1s these United States of America. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I look at <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I look at <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , who made billions and billions of dollars taking advantage of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Turning Jews back after they had successfully escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Shiploads of Jews who tried to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the chosen <span class="REGION">land</span> , and were rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Those are a little more interesting to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I know what happened, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Could it happen anywhere else? </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Yes it could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">There is the part that is sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">That is the part that is tough to understand how humans become such atrocious beasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">That is tough to digest, to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">No, it's not that hard to understand, but to understand the German question, like that, you have to go almost into the history before Christ and definitely bring in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and definitely bring in whatever that contribute to factors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Treaty of Versailles, anti-Jewish sentiment at different times in the world, not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">How one can do certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">How can a man rape an innocent girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">The simple answer is you have to be sick, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Unfortunately a lot of it's probably like when you go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , if you say one day, hey guys, why don't we get together this weekend and help some elderly people in a <span class="BUILDING">rest home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Nobody shows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But if you say hey I got a little grass, let's smoke some joint and raise some <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and screw some girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">So the negative seems to be more attractive to people, especially those who don't have a very healthy foundation, and so there is no way in the world I can excuse, I cannot justify. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Can I understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Yeah, I can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I really resent the fact that I can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I wish I couldn't, but I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">The first time, after I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo train</span> , so here I am escaping again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">After seven years I returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I had prepared how to go back and kill the spider. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I remembered him more than any SS guard, especially the Lithuanian SS guards who were the most sadistic ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">No, the spider, the spider was on my mind day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I had a gun and I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in which he lived, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was right next to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And I kind of had rehearsed with myself, nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I said, do you remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I'm the one who stood in the circle four or five times, I'm the one you let suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I'm the one this and this, you remember me now, does it come back to your senses? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Then I would have killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">The lady came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I said I would like to speak to Dr. , that was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Oh, I'm sorry, but he moved about a month ago, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Well, I didn't go after him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> because after that came the moment of reconsideration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">What do I do, what do I do by killing him, what do I establish 1n that, so then you kind of put it behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">But that was, that was a moment I will always remember, I went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I hoped I would see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">God, I hated him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Because you just don't have a right to make a human or an animal suffer to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Unfortunately there are people who derive pleasure from doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">QUESTION:  Sounded like he enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">ANSWER:  Getting a power trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  I think what I'll do 1s , but before I ask you this, we just don't have the time to go into the post war experience , So I don't think I'll really move into that, so instead of doing it separately, we do want to in on the picture and maybe | piece of paper you showed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">because that's going to take a little time , SO before I do that, just in this section we hear something, is there anything that might have to your mind in the last couple hours that you thought, well I'll have to make sure I tell, tell that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">ANSWER:  Oh well, there are so many little episodes, but it's not really enjoyable to talk about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">It's a little tough so I think, but I told you enough really and I was asked before I gave the interview to bring pictures and I'm very sorry to say that the only picture I could find is a picture of me when I was 15 and you see me in the uniform of the Hitler youth and that was I at 15 and I know that this is true, because my mother wrote on the back this is Walter and the picture was taken by my brother Paul in the spring of 1941, so this is two years before I became a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I think the certificates have very little value, I just brought them along.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">QUESTION:  Do you that closer or just ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Why don't you just show us that one certificate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">ANSWER:  Well this lives any more, but this is a copy, this you'll see is the barbed wire here, this is an organization that sprung up, about right after the liberation and it became known as the Union of Former Political Concentration Camp Prisoners and Political Prisoners and this simply asked the railroad and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and so on to give me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and be nice to me because I had TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">This is mainly it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  The TB cleared up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  Your TB cleared up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">ANSWER:  Yes, except when I was admitted to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , then an x-ray was taken and I was told, well I'm very sorry but we cannot give you your final documents because we have to take another x-ray and see whether what we see on the x-ray is scar tissue, or whether it's active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">quarantine station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span> I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">They took another x-ray and compared, there was no change, so that meant it was just scar tissue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So other than that, I'm pretty healthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">QUESTION:  Thank you very much .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">ANSWER:  It was, well it was not a pleasure, but it was, not a pleasure to talk about it, it was pleasure to meet you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Conclusion of Interview </span>
