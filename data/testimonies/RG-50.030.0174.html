<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My father had a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that sold milk and eggs, hardly eked out a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My mother was watching the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We were seven kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And my father also was a baltfele (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="12">That means a step lower than a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And he was earning some money during the high holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  What was your childhood like? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">What <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> are we in first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  We are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and I was a religious boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I was one, when the war broke out in 1939 I was only fourteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was a year after my bar mitzvah...
QUESTION:  Let's let's back up a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I want to go... I don't want to get to'39 yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Tell me about growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh, what was your childhood like, growing up in...
ANSWER:  A very happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We were seven children, and one was watching the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There was always a competition, who would say better at the tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Who would bring home a better report card? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Who would be better at the... There were always in the family an uncle or another person that always will test you on a Saturday night what you learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And your reward was a five cents that was that was good to buy an ice cream cone. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">For ten cents you can buy a chocolate bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So if we ...1f I made by mine... It was my mother's uncle; if I made by him a dime, it was uh really a big winning. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And for we our day start off like early in the morning we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to pray with the people to with my father and older brother and doing uh we will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> say like 1f we would start at seven, seven thirty we'll be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , have breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And by nine o'clock we start our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So we, I went to a , a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , and from nine to twelve we learned strictly only to talk Jewish . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">From twelve to one we had lunch, but lunch in Europe was like dinner time. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We had a full-course of meal from twelve to one. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">At one we went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We had to be there like one fifteen, and from one fifteen till four o'clock, the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they start teaching us history, geography, math, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And at four o'clock, we only had like a five minutes break to buy a little something like a chocolate or a candy, or... And we went back to - it was in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learned from four 'til six. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And at six o'clock, my mother would give me like a nickel or a dime and I would buy myself a roll of butter with a piece of herring, some nights with cheese, and go back to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was like a ..... (ph), and there we will try to do our homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Work mostly in the Talmud what we learn in our , and then we drop them in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">there was no television. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We did not have the radio in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I recall we had like a <span class="INT_SPACE">three room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">three room apartment</span> we slept uh two in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and there was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> that was, they opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">One child will sleep, one brother with the head one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the other one will sleep with the head the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , so their feet will - so that was more convenient to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , then a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and my father and mother slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> with the younger children. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We seemed always to have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> if somebody else came over to sleep over. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We did not have the toys that the uh - what we used to do, we couldn't even afforded to buy uh rubber ball, because I played soccer - when I had a little chance, I play I liked to play soccer, so we would take some rags, roll them them up, sew them up like in when it was finished looked almost like a baseball with the stitches - that's what we would kick around. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Very seldom it has a bounce. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But we had a very, maybe we didn't see anything better, but we were very happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And everything uh everybody was looking forward, we knew there were things getting bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> cause since uh when I start to recognize and understand certain things, that in 1935, '36, when the Marshall of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Marshall Pilsudski, had died, the anti-Semitism because maybe they wanted, the Poles want to be friendly with the Germans or maybe that was in fashion like they say, anti-Semitism had start growing 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to a very untolerable situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow Kazimierz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And it was strictly... It was called the Kazimierz, after the Kazimierz, the great King Kazimierz who let the Jews come into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with so many hundred years back. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And in , mostly was Jewish, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , Jewish shopkeepers, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogues</span> , so I personally did not have any connection, special connection with gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We had our own life. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Of course we learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Polish but uh we did not come in any contact and we, our business and our daily life had no mingling with the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And there was, I overheard all our politicking was going on in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I overheard the, as a child I liked to listen that the uh some young people were and they were screaming to the older people that Hitler may be coming and conquer <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> - we have to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I don't know from the olderies (ph) first of all we were told, respect the elder people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">When an elder person spoke, we were quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We only listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We wouldn't dare even answer them anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So they say that they remember the Germans from World War I. They are cultured. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They're intelligent and the argument was going with some, we would come and that after all, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, and he's out to destroy the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So they gave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They say Hitler's a maniac, but the German people will definite not come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They will never hurt us. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And then for what reason should they hurt us. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We are Polish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We are law-abiding citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And why would they hurt us? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So that was the, maybe now if for a Monday morning quarterback, maybe it's, 1t was their wishful thinking, because the average family was eight, ten and even twelve people in a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Mostly, ninety percent or more, were very poor, hardly eking out a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Nobody had a, they may had a little uh piece of ring or piece of gold, some silverware, but wealth, currency - very few Jews had because they had always to borrow when it came a sabbath or when it came a high holiday, or any holidays if they want to prepare a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> they had to go out and borrow some money, so currency nobody had. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And it was very hard for a family of eight or ten to go - nobody, no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world would take them, and of course we did not have the state or vision (ph), so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there would be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity, have the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  What happened when the war did break out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  But in 1939, we were first worried that my father may be taken to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He was born in 1900, and he was only 39 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But a few weeks before the war broke out, they changed the slip of paper - the there were red cards, blue cards, white cards, and there was must have been that day because of having seven children - the youngest child was four years old when the war broke out - that they did not call him to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And the war broke out on September 1, 1939, on a Friday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">To me, I didn't know what's in store. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">To me it wasn't the most uh important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">To me it was more important we had uh a championship going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macabi</span> , the soccer team, and that was important to me, but on Wednesday morning I went out near the outskirts from the Wis_a[NB: the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="83"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wis _a</span> is the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> [NB: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ] that runs through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I went over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to Mos, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mostowa</span> (ph) and I saw already Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So I ran back to my dad because my dad received then to go into the army, to be in the next few days near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at a certain post. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So I screamed to and I told my dad don't go because the Germans are already here. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And the Germans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> on Wednesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">That was September the 6th. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And to say they didn't bother us, we didn't bother them. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But the first brutality I saw on the high holidays - I liked to run from one <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , from one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or one <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> to the other <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> to listen to the cantor singing, and as I was going in the <span class="DLF">street</span> on the , most of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> had open <span class="DLF">doors</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and Germans came in and they happened to be Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They were not SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I learned later about SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Plain Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Went into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , pulled out the Jews, older people, took the thales, the skrols, throw it in the garbage, ripped it up and literally they say that they took out the Jews to shave their beards and their [side]locks, and literally I saw them ripping - blood was gushing from their faces from the people and they were laughing and they were smile and then I realized that something is wrong somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That I couldn't believe my own eyes, what I saw, and we made up our mind at that time, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had built-in <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> so we built in a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> , and we hide our father, because our father still had a beard, and we and he didn't want to shave his beard because of the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we were afraid in case my father will go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> he will be recognized as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So we did all our, whatever work we, whatever little business, whatever to sustain our family, my older brother, myself and my younger two brothers, we did our dealings, and it was till maybe October or November when the first snow came on the on the , not only the snow on Ka...on our <span class="DLF">street</span> - it's snowing all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , maybe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> too, but the first snowstorm - they closed off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they start going door to <span class="DLF">door</span> , only to Jewish families in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and it couldn't go through my mind - there were calling us Jews with lice, Juden (ph), dirty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Yet so nice they asked if you have a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My mother had a little ring, a little candelabra for lighting the candles on shabbat, a little piece of - they took everything away. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">On some occasions, people said that they even give them a little paper that they took it, enough that they was going to give it back to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But I was one of the boys that they took down to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and they make bundles - everybody makes for himself a bundle and roll down to his mother, the soldiers, yeah, to his mother - that that was already SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">There was difference because normally the Wehrmacht will be the fighters and the SS will be the administrators. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So I saw that they uh in here to rob us with everything we got, but yet we didn't, we didn't care so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We were never hang up on, we didn't have wealth and we were not hanged up on the piece of stuff that we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">To us it was important, the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">As long as we stayed whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But every few weeks new laws came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Laws that a Jew has to wear on his right arm an arm band with the Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">If you were caught without it, you were subject to being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We didn't pay too much attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was a blonde boy, blue eyes, spoke a perfect Polish, and I was little. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I was never a tall boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So I could pass for below twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I didn't carry no papers with me so I kept on screaming if somebody asked me why didn't you wear the star, I was saying I'm not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And again we worried only about our father and every time they passed a new law, a Jew has to do this, and above everything, when they came in they start confiscating <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I'm not talking about the Poppa and Momma store, little <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> or little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luncheonette</span> but stores of meaning - textiles, shoes, col...colonial - that is coffee and tea, some specialities and of course the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And in most cases they took away Jewish out of the Kazmierz. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They took out <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> and they took it away for them, from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They tell them that they need it for their administrative group. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And the more high ranked you were in the list by the Gestapo or by the SS, a bigger <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or a bigger <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> you receive. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In that case, Oskar Schindler received the biggest <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , the Patzenpen (ph) factory. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I get back to that later on, but let me tell you about the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">In March of 1940, things start to go very bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">My father had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_arow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That's near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , and he wrote us food is better, you can get better food in the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> than in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so he took his whole family and he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_aroéw</span> except myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I stayed to watch the belongings in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I stayed there for a few months and what's happening while those were coming out, then from time to time they fooled the people and they start loosen up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So there was talk - we only lived by rumors, so there were rumors that the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> can come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So by July, my parents and the children came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">In August, the beginning of August, they asked us to be, to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">If we register and they like the idea who we are, what we are, we will have the privilege to go in in March, it was already written down that in March of 1941 it will be established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And only if you worthy you going to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">If you're not worthy, you'll be shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My father registered, and that was a part of fooling the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">If you register, then they know you are, they know your <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My father registered and my mother registered and that was some papers that I found in the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw archives</span> after the war, and in 1941, like in February, I went out again to get some food for the family, and a Polish policeman grabbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he said, "Why are you here so early? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You must be Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I kept saying, "No, I'm not Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So he took me to...he said, "Let's find out if you're Jewish or not." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And he took me to the Gestapo and they pulled my pants down. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I... They start asking me where I live, and I didn't want to give up my family, give out my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I stayed and I said uh whatever will happen will happen; and one of the Gestapo came out and he says to the Polish policeman, there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> full of Jews that they are being deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_a Podlaska</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That was on the <span class="REGION">east side</span> , near the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where the Russians took part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> --near that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And he even used the word: "Take that little scheiss and put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I was very happy to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_a Podlaska</span> ; and I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a letter and saying, "Dad and Ma - I can escape because nobody's watching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Should I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I'm coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So I immediately got back a letter not to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that they were already marked also to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They were not accepted to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because my father had no trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And very seldom do they took seven, a family of with seven, eight, nine people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They took to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> young people with one child or two children and those who worked for the uh they can show papers and those special papers was called the , and if they got the , that means if you work, then you could go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Many people had signed up to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory Emailia</span> , NKF [NB: Neue Kuhler- und Flugzeugteile-Fabrik] by Schindler. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">People paid, they signed out if they own a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , diamonds, whatever they could lay their hands on, to get those papers to be able to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My father and mother and the six children was sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [Podlaski]. </span><span class="sentence" id="158"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [Podlaski], from Bia _a Podlaska, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is no more than twenty-one kilometer. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That's about fifteen miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And one morning, I'm walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I see my father . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I said to my father, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He said, "Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I came to take you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We are all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podlaski</span> ]." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podlaski</span> ], and we were told then the reason we are sent in this direction of the east that the <span class="DLF">fields</span> are more fertilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It's easier to feed the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we were hoping that this is the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And that was April, May; and my brother and myself were assigned to work for the Germans, to cut the furrows and to make <span class="DLF">roads</span> for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aeroplanes</span> , to make <span class="DLF">aeroplane fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Because the Germans had in their mind to start to attack the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And June 22nd in 1941, the war with Russians had started; and my brother and myself, every night we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The fact is while we were walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , about ten kilometers, we were stopping at a farmer, exchange - money was not worth anything - but exchange for little something. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He would give us some potatoes, some corn, some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And that's how we sustain ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">When the war broke out on June 22nd, they tell us we cannot go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And they start putting wires around us and they said they are making a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And they need our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They need to load up some stuff and one day, before they start putting the electric wire on it, my brother and myself escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we ran in for five minutes to our <span class="BUILDING">father's home</span> , and we said we're not going to stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We running back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We going to sneak in 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We're going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> 1s a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Maybe we can pass for Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So we start by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And when we came in like half-way, near the Wis_a; and I was stuck in in ; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowy Korczyn</span> , in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My brother was stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staszow</span> , by a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I had no food to eat, so during that time, 1t was like in July, there were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> some green apples, and I ate those green apples and I have uh (ph) diarrhea and I got very sick, so I was going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and finally near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowy Korczyn</span> there was a Polish family who needed a shepherd boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They had cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I said, "I will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I don't want no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Only thing I want is to get a little better and get some potatoes, uh cooked potatoes, so...so my stomach will get better." </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And meantime, in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [Podlaski], my family was starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There was no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So my father put on clothes like uh...like a man [who] was a farmer, and he got himself a a paper that he is uh like a Polish farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he went back to his brother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_aréw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And my mother took five children, dressed like a peasant girl, took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And when she came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , the <span class="DLF">gates</span> for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We had an uncle in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so he sent out somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And he said, "The best thing for you 1s to go like twenty-five, thirty kilometer. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Near...there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proszowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proszowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You can go there and get from a farmer a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for you for your family." </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">She had a few zlotys--that's Polish currency--and she rented; and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stagniowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So in 1941, maybe it was September, October, she rented a one-room <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And my father couldn't stand uh being without his wife and children, so from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_ardéw</span> he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staszow</span> and collected my younger brother, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staszow</span> they come to [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowy] Korczyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We wrote letters to each other into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to my uncle, Isaac Levenstein (ph), who was my mother's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He stayed with his wife and two children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He had...he happened to have in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> from before the war that was like Brillos, but without the soap, and he maked those Brillos for the soldiers, for the for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So he had the privilege, him and another partner, to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So we had our con...contact through that uncle, so my father knew by which farmer I was uh near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowy Korczyn</span> , and it was after the holiday, high holiday, and he collected me and we all went and we finally hooked up together with my mother and she was there with five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And we were all nine again together from 1941, by October; and was the happiest days of our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">In one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And the greatest pain that I can see, when my mother was cooking some food (crying) and she would say she's not hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We knew she was hungry, but she wouldn't allow herself to have a little food because she wouldn't take it away from her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We...again we had to register in the Jewish because to get some rationing, some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Without it we couldn't sustain ourselves, so towards the end of 1941, they say that for to feed our family, one, a male, especially the husband, the men in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , has to go to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lager camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So my brother said he will go, to save our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So my brother went. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The end of '41 he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U lag</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">In March of 1942, they said they need more men to go to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So again we want to save our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And in 1942 I came to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of bricks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I could have escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Was easy to escape, but they hold our family hostage. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">If we would escape, they knew where our family lived, so for the love for our family, we gladly stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="231">It wasn't so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So we all always lived with the idea, the Russian...the Russians already fighting with the Germans, the British, the French, that an end will come very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And to sustain ourselves and to also help out the uncle in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that I mentioned to you, my two brothers and a sister also blonde, blue-eyes, will go by little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> - that was a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , not a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> - will go from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and they will smuggle into the ghetto flour, bread, eggs sometimes - whatever they could lay their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Even sometimes a piece of meat, and they will bring it to the uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The uncle normally will have it for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Sometimes he will sell it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that stuff, and from that my parents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">In 1942 they start liquidating all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And maybe it was luck and maybe it was not luck, they forgot about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We were on the outskirts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proszowice</span> , and maybe nobody put up a list on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And they...they made, it was called visedlenie (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="241">That means taking the people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">There was always, they always take out some people and the rest they left over because they said we need you. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So the, now the hindsight, the Monday morning quarterback, I would understand that they took out the men so the women and the children could not put up the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">When they had us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they make <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> already, and they change it from a regular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Tell me you had no choice to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">You couldn't fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">You couldn't escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So in 1942, in the meantime, they open up a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , what's called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow-P_aszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ierozolimska</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was a new <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and it was called Ierozolimska (ph) and that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So on that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , they build <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> --factories, that they make shoes, uniforms, brushes, whatever they could get the work out from the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The knit...<span class="BUILDING">knitting factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They make sweaters, socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And they prepared this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So from the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U lag,</span> I myself with my brother were united...with my older brother; and we stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="256">In the first there was an Obersturmfthrer Miller (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He wasn't so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And it wasn't so bad ‘til on a Friday in 1942, it must have been like September, when Amon Goeth took over that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="259">In the first, it was on a Friday morning - I will never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">When he took over that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they took us from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> --it was called "appellplatz"--the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that they count us. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Every day, they count us like we would be worth a fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And...and in that moment, Goeth took out... There was, we was run by Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The SS was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and inside in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was only a few SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But most was run by Jewish police, and Jewish kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So they took out, he took out the leader from the Jewish police, Katz, and his second his in command, Goldberg, and they shot them both on the spot, Katz and Goldberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I start seeing the brutality of Amon Goeth, and he said I'm going to shoot every Jew if you're not going to obey, if you're not going to work diligently, so in that time I I saw that we are in for a lot a lot of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">In the meantime at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in 1942 after the high holidays, they found out there were people hiding and they would start cleaning up when they had finished the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , they start going to the outskirts, and my father saw from far away that some Germans are coming with some, that some people, there's a lot of horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , there's a lot of things going on, so he pushed out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a brother right after me and another one and and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They pushed them out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he said run. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So they run into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They knew their way to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so they run into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">My father and mother and the youngest sister and the youngest brother, they took to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miechow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miechow</span> , they had at that time maybe eighty or ninety Jews altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So they asked the men to stay on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and the women and children on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They didn't know what they're going to do, but my father will not have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He said, "I will not leave my wife or with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Whatever will happen to her, will happen to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They took the men out 1n the <span class="NPIP">side</span> and they asked one, always will ask the the commander, what should we do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So they said, "It's not enough people to make a transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Shoot them on the spot." </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And they killed my father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">One was holding one child in the hand and one was holding the other child in the hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I know it for a fact, because two days later the men who were segregated were brought into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they were crying like little babies, that they left their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They felt the guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">It was the murderers who put them to that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Because after all, we are taught that life is so precious, that life with force you are born and with force you must die. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You cannot take your own life, that life by Jewish people is very precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But they knew my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They knew my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And that was the beginning of that I lost my father and mother and a brother and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And in the meantime, I was with my older brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">In 194...and I building <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We were building <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We were building <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It was, we were in two different groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They normally separated so first we were in one group but then we were in separate groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Every group had fifty peo...boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And with fifty boys went a Jewish kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">In 1943, in March, beginning of March, they liquidated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">My two brothers and sister did not have papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They they were not legally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so they hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They hid and they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on a Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I think it was March Ilth. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And by Wednesday, and they brought in all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And one occasion I I will forget that - the women were coming out and one woman had in her knapsack a little baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And the little baby was crying, and the German heard...heard the baby crying, and he killed the baby and the mother on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Shot them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And our group from were taken to right on Sunday they start cleaning out those people who had no papers and those people who were hide, they were bringing up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> , and we, the boys, had to take them down some of them were complete dead, some was not dead - in one case I saw a girl, a young child that wasn't dead, and we asked the German give the girl, give her ,aaa a thing of mercy, so we wouldn't bury her alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So he said, shmutzige, shit (ph), he said, throw it just in the way it is and it's it's it's a shot (ph) to throw in, to waste a bullet on that piece of uh you know what I'm talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And my uncle was taken into the P_aszdw (ph) and he left in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> his wife and two children to be hidden, for the children were not legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And my bro...two brothers and a sister were there too, and every day, every night when I come back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , he would say did you see any familiar faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And every day, every time I look at a corpse that looks a little bit similar, I turned it around to see if it's any of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Till on Wednesday that week, they brought in my brother and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And I found out later that one brother escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">How he escaped is beyond me, but he had escaped and he was walking around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">My brother and sister were, mind you, they probably were hungary so they left the ghe...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were on the <span class="DLF">road</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> already on the bottom, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not watched anymore by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It was watched by the Poles because it was all quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The only thing they did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Maybe people put some wealth in the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They start looking and maybe they thought somebody was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They took boys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> to look over and to check out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if nobody is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But they themselves were finished with the all the brutal work that they done. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And two Polish policemen killed my brother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And I know it for a fact, because I... people told me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">'Cause people who work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They maybe were for lookout for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">When you were working the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you look out for somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You open up, you cut a piece of wire to let them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And they could not escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So I had lost another brother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So we were left three in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I heard about my younger brother, that he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> working at the Wis_a by uh those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and he he 1s sustaining himself, 'til 1944, he was all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> til October or November. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">October or November, when the Wis _a froze up they had no work for him on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He went, he had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And he went to sleep out _ up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> where they kept the salt hay for the cows and for the on the outskirts from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And a Polish peasant caught him, and he said, "If you sleeping in during the winter in that uh snow <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you must be Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So he knew the prayers of uh the Catholic prayers as as better than any Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And he said the prayers in front of him, but nothing helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And he received an award for that, twelve pounds--that's five kilo--sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">For every time you gave out a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you got a reward of five kilo sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I know it for a fact, because after the war I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and people told me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I asked him to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He said, "There's no use of testifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The man ran away." </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I'm positive surely he did not run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But I didn't know who the man was, and I couldn't bring him to any justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I was left with my brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">In 1943, about...it could have been in August or September - it was already chilly a little bit - I worked in [the] <span class="BUILDING">Barrackenbau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We were fifty boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> came in a new commander tn chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">His name was Frank (ph) and Amon Goeth tried to be friendly with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So he took out all our fifty boys with, we loaded up loads of topsoil on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we went near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakovia</span> (ph) place. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There was a big beautiful <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> and we made a <span class="DLF">garden</span> for Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">While we maked the <span class="DLF">garden</span> on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , one of the boys escaped and when we got in we were forty-nine and our kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And the kapo didn't notice it that he escaped, so he started beating us over the head with his stick, the night stick that the policeman carries, and they wouldn't let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They waited until Goeth comes down from his <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , and Goeth came in and he said, where's the fiftieth? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We all say we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We didn't even know him we said. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Maybe we only went out forty-nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So he said for that that one escape, he shot every second boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">A boy was shot next to me, to my right, and a boy was shot on the left of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I cannot recall if 1t was twenty-four or twenty-five, but all we were left is half of our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The other half of our group was shot right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I saw it will be impossible to live and to be in the <span class="BUILDING">Barrackenbau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">It was the worst work and was working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I, maybe I learned like the animal the necessity of survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I recognize Goeth when he's ready to shoot people. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He will have with him that the instinct of an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">He would not eat his breakfast or sometimes lunch unless he saw Jewish blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And he will wear three different hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The officer's hat, the plain soldier's hat and a Tyrol like when you go <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> (ph), uh a Tyrol hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">That Tyrol hat was the most dangerous hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And by the way, Amon Goeth was an Austrian, and he was called in 1946 and people testified and they hanged him in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So when he would go in with this hat, I would always sneak away, because regardless if you work hard or not, whenever it was convenient for him, for no reason at all, he'd while he was riding his horse, from the horse he will shoot, or even while he was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He will go over, behind the ear - that was his specialty. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Go over to a man, behind his ear shoot him, and then scream and yell, then go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">People testified and he was saying now you can give me my lunch or my breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So it was, being in the Barakenbau (ph) was almost unbear...unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So at night, after everybody finished their work at six o'clock, instead of going back to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to relax, I would go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> I would chop wood for the people who work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I will also wash for them their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And I did a good job at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And once I caught the eye of the SS man, and he said why are you working here. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">You're not working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , cause I was shabby dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And I said I need food. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I'm hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So he said, for you working so hard and I chopped the wood very good and I washed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> good, when we will enlarge, they kept constantly enlarging that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from ten thousand to twenty thousand, there were the people to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I will give you, I will assign you to a kettle. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And sure enough, even normally this was assigned by the Jewish police, so one morning I was called in to get a kettle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , in in the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a kettle in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And the Jewish policeman said, we didn't send you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So the German said, I gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">If he wouldn't say the word, I gave it to him, they would probably beat me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I thought they would probably kill me by beating me, so that was like the end of 1943, and my working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I had the opportunity to help myself, help my other friends and especially help my elder brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And that was from 1944 in May - it was Mother's Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They , Mutter, Mutter (ph), and Mengele came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And again we were taken to the <span class="DLF">appellplatz</span> , to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And he put markers on small children, on elderly people, and we didn't know what the markers were for. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I stood with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We were holding hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They marked my brother and they didn't mark me. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I knew that something is wrong somewhere, that somebody going...something's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">A week later we were called again, and our names were, the names were called out. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">My older brother's name was called out, and they took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; and a day later he was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So in 1944 in May, I was left only with that little brother that was running around still in the...and I told you already the story about it, but uh I was ahead of myself a little bit, but in 1944 in May I was left with a younger brother out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> somewhere, hoping that he can survive, and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">In August, I was ready to be shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> , I had certain feelings not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And that time they took the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Who knows whether I would have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And a day later I came back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the SS man, Guntz (ph) was his name, Gunther (ph), Guntz Gunther said you supposed to be on the tra...on the to go to with the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">What, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So for an excuse I told him I fell asleep in my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So he called up to (ph) and he said what should we do with uh one of my people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , but he did say that I'm a good worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He said if you need him, let him stay until the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And they start liquidating all small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They started bringing in people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Amalia</span> , and for the first time I heard about people talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amalia</span> , that there's Oskar Schindler. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oskar Schindler</span> , in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> nobody gets beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Nobody is hungry and nobody is overworked, so I just couldn't understand it but when they took people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amalia</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> and they put them on a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> - it was like August and was the sun was unbearable, burning on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and he bribed Amon Goeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">While I came from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with some, first to give them soup, and opened up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to get a little air. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">He helped people and I was uh asked to do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Water hoses and we hosed down with cold water the roofs of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and he was screaming to the Germans, Oskar Schindler, that the Jews are all mechanics, engineers, that the Germans need them, and he guarantees that nobody will escape, to open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So I looked at myself, I said like, is this aa German or this an angel? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He wore civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I had no idea who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I knew only that he received the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> from Amalia and he was the only one who did not throw out the Jews, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owner was Benks, that he not only took that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , he took a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> and he build <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and he saved a few hundred Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My partner Ben Zuckerman was there and got and he was shipped away, also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">In October of 1944 I was called among other people, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span> was starting getting liquidated, cause the Russians are too close and that we going deeper into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> , mind you, was East Ger...now it's <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It's on the <span class="DLF">border</span> Silesia. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I at least did not see any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> of five days was the most that they would let you stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They complete undress you. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You couldn't have nothing that belongs to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">They make you spread your your legs and and check, cut off your hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Nothing that could belong to you that you could have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">All you got is uh pair of pants - no underwear, a shirt, a cap and a jacket and a pair of wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">That was, and a number on the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">That's all, and for five days if somebody from the SS called that a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> needs a hundred people, five hundred people, a thousand people, then no no question was it, then they shipped them out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">If after five days nobody called you, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">The first day we came in, they gave us showers and we didn't know if we going to get gas or we're going to get water. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We knew already about it, it was on under they had a that under <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> that you walked into Gross Rosen, it said in German, here you enter, and then there was a big <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and it says on the big <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , and over there you go now. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It's supposed to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We sat in crutches (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Inside on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , spread our legs and one was sitting right into the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">If one, and we were so packed if one had to sneeze or move, everybody had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Like glued in like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we were taken to a doctor, and the five days, I saw truckloads of young Poles who tried to take over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , make an , and they were taken and they immediately were given gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Young, eighteen, twenty years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And everybody was saying that the same thing works for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The fourth or the fifth night they were saying that Oskar Schindler came to Gross Rosen with a list, and that people are on the list, and when I heard my name called out, Murray Pantirer, Moses Pantirer, sheet metal worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Until this day I have no idea who put me there because to be, everybody knew that they making lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">People were promising, there was, the list was made with Schindler and also Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">People promised Marcel Goldberg diamonds, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that after the war they will assign. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I had nothing to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Was a very poor boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And almost everybody was poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">What, at least some of it had maybe some belongings that they hid some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I had no belongings I hid no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And to have my name in it, if I would be a kind of fanatic, I would say an angel flew down from <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> and wrote down my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Maybe it meant to be that at least one of our Pantirer (crying) should survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">In October, the fifth day, they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and I want to bring out a very important point right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">The Germans claimed that they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We knew, when we were walking from, to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we were pelted with stones and we called S Juden (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="461">When we passed only from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the people were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The Czechs were throwing bread at us, and they were standing with such a sad faces that you can tell that they were with us, that the Czechs were with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And when we came to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brnenc</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brinnlitz</span> ], <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and some boys had to go out to work in the <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> , every night there were potatoes and bread hidden in the <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> by the Czechs, who they themselves had very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And they gave to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They were the least collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They were most uh at least they they were insensitive what's happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brnenc</span> , I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was assigned to clean by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We're going to hold it, Murray. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Let's hold it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We need to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">TAPE #2
QUESTION:  OK, Murray. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We're back on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Tell us what happened to you after you were put on Schindler's list. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  I was called out in Gross Rosen among other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They give us some food and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but we were all very excited because uh we knew that if Oskar Schindler came and brought in a list that somehow there's an opportunity of survival, that we may be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We knew that uh <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was all occupied, almost occupied by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We knew that the Allied forces are doing good in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , so to us it was like a a new lease on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">The .... (ph), uh maybe it wasn't convenient but there's nothing what to complain about because we knew we're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brnenc</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brnenc</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was a different situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Was a few SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There were no barbed wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">There was an old <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and we're supposed to fix up that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And Oskar Schindler was not happy that he took out eight or nine hundred Jews from Gross Rosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He went a few weeks later to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and got out three hundred women, and he said in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that he needs them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I can testify to you the only thing I saw them doing is getting wool and knit sweaters for their husbands or boyfriends or friends or socks or gloves. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Very little work did they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">As a matter of fact we all did very little work. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We always was scared that something's going to happen that he will be called, because we did not produce a single piece of ammunition, not a single piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Once we were told that he bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> load of ammunition from another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and delivered that it is from our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Once we were told that he kept saying, Oh, I'm almost almost there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I have to, and he alwa...he welcomed us and he said, you are the Schindler's Juden, and here you will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Nothing going to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I was assigned to work in the <span class="REGION">areas</span> where the Ger...the SS were living in their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I shined their shoes, so I always had a little extra piece of bread, had a piece of cigarette from the ends uh that I could come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and always share it, exchange it for a piece of bread because people looked for the cigarette even if they were hungry, they gave you a piece of bread to have that cigarette, because they were they were addicted to the cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I didn't smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I was young, and I would do some work in Schindler's own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so I had uh a matter of fact I could say that I walked out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a healthy boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I never had uh those uh boils on my body and somehow I, how it happened I don't know but I have to give you a a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">In February of 1944, '45, a call came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that on a <span class="DLF">siding</span> not far from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the Germans left carloads of people just to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They need the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> , that's the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">engines</span> , they needed for their own use. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And the Czech who worked on the <span class="DLF">siding</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , asked his superior to call in to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that people are just laying there and dying, if our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> will accept them. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And Oskar Schindler and his wife said yes, they will accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">That was mostly Hungarian Jews, and they brought us, brought them into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They they send out an engine from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we had an engine and it brought in, and I was among some young boys who learned with picks and shovel to open up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> was so frozen from the human things, from the urine and the other stuff, so wet, that we couldn't open them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So with hot water we opened them finally up and when we opened up and we saw the crying out of the people, we we were thinking we doing them a favor - one grabbed him by the shoulders and the other grabbed him by, and I grabbed him by the feet, and they were so frozen their behind that we ripped their skins. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And the screaming was unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So what we did we worked slowly, and we worked like almost impossible task. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">If we hold our fingers, if we put too hot water we will burn them. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Too cold water, it didn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So we had to try to, and lift them up, and we lift up maybe about twenty-eight or thirty young men like skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And we took them into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and Mrs. Schindler was cooking cereal for them every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They were in a separate <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , cause the stink from them, the smell was just unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And she would ask one of our boys, sometimes myself, to carry in the food and you had to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And out of the twenty-eight a few people have died and a few walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I was on a gathering for the Yad Vashem to valey (ph) that we <span class="BUILDING">building</span> now three years ago, and a man walked over to me and he said, are you Murray Pantirer? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I live in Long Island. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">You are the one who pulled me from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So not only he didn't kill people, he has on his, he and his wife were the real righteous people that they help anybody they could have helped to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Tell us about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">What was Oskar Schindler like? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">What was what was Oskar Schindler like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  Oskar Schindler was, as a figure, kind of looks like our President Ford. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Well dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Sometimes I couldn't figure out why he's doing those things and maybe it's, I try to to explain it that he was such a powerful man that he did not have to knock anybody down to make himself so powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And I used to drink with him enough . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He used to like cognac, so after the war, you say when a person is under alcoholic influence maybe he will talk and I kept on asking him, him, and he always said to me the same thing - he couldn't stand the killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">He he couldn't see that one human being should do the same thing to a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He said to me, I will never deny I was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Let me give you a little background from as far as Oskar Schindler is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suddeten</span> (ph), German. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">That was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Before World War I, that belonged to King Franz Joseph (ph), to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , but after the war it was given back to the Czechs, so he did not like the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">His father and mother was Suddeten Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And when he was in the Czech army, he spied for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He gave uniforms from the Czech army to the Germans and the Germans up a lot of those uniforms and when they attacked in 1938 <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they attacked with their uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They camouflaged it that they, so they didn't loose people, and he was on hierarchy and he had a lot of friends, and he he went for the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">No question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">He was happy to have this kind of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">At the, I used to call them the men with the three W's - wealth, women and whiskey. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And we met him all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">In 1972 when in January when mine wife and myself, we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary, before Christmas, we got him over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We always made him parties and '72, in January, he was at our celebration of the 25th wedding anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I, we always met him in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and was always the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Like regardless how many schnopzs, how many cognacs he had, he always said he could not stand the killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So when he was written up in somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or he may have some friends, he was always getting himself in...he was plenty of times in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He was put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> a few times, but not for long. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He always had somebody and he somehow somehow he managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And after the war his best life was for him when he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He will sit in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we will have a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Plenty of times he sit in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but he will always call us the Schindler Juden and my children he used to call kinder, his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And it's, I II don't have no words to describe you the man, the niceness, the feelings that this man had for the Jewish people and always was the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I'm not trying to say that uh he loved the Jewish people, but he just couldn't stand this this uh innocent people being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Then he turned against the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But in the beginning he was working with them, and he also was a good business man. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">When the Germans would throw out the Jew who when they took over some <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , he stayed and he wanted to learn how to make money with the Jewish people, and he made, he made quite quite a bit of money, but he let it go through because uh he couldn't hold on to a dollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And when he passed away in '76, they buried him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , in the <span class="DLF">Catholic cemetery</span> , and it's the only tombstone that it's written up, . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">That say that here lays a arighteous, among righteous people. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">He was the third tree (ph) for the righteous people and the of was given to Oskar Schindler. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He received the Buben Prize. </span><span class="sentence" id="567"><span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> supported him. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And of course there's a book written up about him and I hope that someday a movie will be written about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  Let's get back a little to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of of <span class="BUILDING">Oskar Schindler</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Tell me a little more about what your day was like with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">What did you do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  It was just passing by the days. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Nobody worked hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Would you believe that there was in April, in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> Jews were baking matzos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They got some flour - either they asked him to bring some flour or he brought in some flour from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Comparing to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in, the last few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that's why I I came out a strong boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">The last few months in the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brnenc</span> was like being in in a ina sanitarlum. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We were never hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He would go with some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , go into the front where the Germans had no time to collect bread, potatoes, meat, and he would bring it to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He would feed us like we would be his own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">For we received . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Everybody got a . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">For his birthday in April, he was born in April, he give us and after the war, while he ran away - he couldn't, he told us, he got us together and he told us - I have to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He didn't tell us the reason but after the war we found out - the Czechs had a death warrant out for him, so he took ten people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with his own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> - he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sports car</span> with two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , load up all the stuff, and he and his wife and some of the from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were going, he said we going to get closer to the <span class="REGION">American side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Most of Germans were afraid to fall into the Ivan. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Ivan is the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They all were going into the front, to the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">They knew that the Americans will treat them better. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The Spies were working for them very good, and he held the speech for us and he gave out ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He wouldn't let the SS go in, and he give out ammunition and he said, defend yourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">If the, if the SS will come in, there was only a few of them, if they will come in - defend yourselves, and also, he was afraid there were —__ in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasov</span> of armies to <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and the White Russians, and they will kill off some of people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and take their identification cards and pretend that they are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , so protect yourselves, but I hope to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And he left uh the beginning of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The first few days in May or maybe the end of April, and then there was a little, a few days very quiet and on May 10th, everybody was screaming the war's over, and the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We were liberated on May 10th, and he told us that he has a key from a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with clothing and materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He left it with one of our head men, and he said everybody as soon as he gets out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> should get a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We got a package for for clothes, for material for clothes, material for suits, material for shirts, for underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Everybody was made a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He prepared packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I, I myself am with with everyone maybe should felt maybe he could have saved another person of his family - that's the only grudge he can have against Schindler, but we owe our lives to Oskar Schindler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  How did he keep the SS away from you all the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  He, he was bribing them awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He had an awful lot of wealth and he had papers that uh he's doing a good job, that he's working for the high ranking uh higher than the SS, Gestapo, whatever they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Maybe if the war would have been another few months, maybe you would have bust. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Nobody knows, but the bottom line is that whatever walked in in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man's camp</span> , plus the Hungarian, mostly Hungarian Jews that I told you about, they walk out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">They're alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">They built families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Tell me about liberation itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  When I was liberated, as I have told you, I was uh a healthy kid so I took with another couple friends who were also healthy, and we start our way back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , when we passed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , we hitch-hiked, we walked a little bit, horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> - the Czechs treated us very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And we didn't know Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We knew Czech a little bit because we knew Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It's a little similarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , if I was riding and I still had the uniform from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they would start to cry and they would give me not one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> mind you - they will stand up and they will let me lay down, and anything they had in their belongings, they would give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I'm sorry to say it but the fact is we felt the anti-Semitism immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I couldn't understand it, but now that I'm getting a little older, maybe they were scared those who collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Maybe the they were afraid there were a lot of Jewish people who gave away everything they own to Polish people to hide for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So they were afraid they're going to come back and get it back from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And a and a Polish person, you don't want to give it back what you have already for three or four years, considered it your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and I walked in in mine <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I told the woman immediately I absolutely don't want nothing from this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">All, everything that was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> belonged to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I didn't care for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I only want to write down a little note. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">If anybody from my family or by miracle somebody survived, I am the second son of Lester (ph) Pantirer. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I survived and I'm registering myself in the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Where I'm going to be I don't know, but I - so she said sit down, have a cup of tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">She sent her son to the militia (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The militia came up and said, why did you come here to make trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I said, what kind of troubles did I make? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I just want to put down on my address, my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I want to put down my name and then we, as I have told you, we got some material so we start selling it on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , so either they will say Jidan (ph), we don't buy stuff from a Jew, or they will say, look - they said they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Look how many they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So I was - among thousands, there were two Jewish boys or three Jewish boys trying to exchange uh for livelihood for stuff that they needed - they didn't want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And in my ear they're constantly saying, Jid .... <span class="COUNTRY">Palestina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Jew go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So I saw, I came to that the commu...the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> was on . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">| wrote down my name with my papers and I told them I'm going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I start going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Literally going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , by hitch-hiking. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Also I had a problem that I was twenty years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I wasn't twenty years when the war ended, but a month later, in June, I was twenty years old, and the Poles start bothering me to go to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">After being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I have no , no feelings to go to the army, so I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> when Benes arrived back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and he, and his Czech I understood when he said, the Jews who survived are welcomed to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but my advice to you is, build your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> are f..., are f....1s full of blood from your families and your friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">You have no future in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">You are welcomed to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but build you...try to find and build a life for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So I went to, from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> for a while, and I heard that there's a Jewish brigade who fou...who fought with British and that they are in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they are making arrangements to get you into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhaufen</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brem...Bremenhaufen</span> (ph), to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> not, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhaufen</span> , Bremenpass and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> I went by foot over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> the first time I came was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> got hooked up with some...that was the end of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I was hooked up with some brigade from the...and they told me to move down all the way to <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> , down at the bottom by the <span class="DLF">port</span> and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> will come and pick me up to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ships</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">There was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I was a single boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">People went down there with families and when I, I stayed there and wait for another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> did not arrive, and I heard that the British intercepting the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I said, where am I going to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp again.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">In 1946, in August, I met my wife and for it was love at first sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">She's a beautiful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">She happens to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and she was also on her way to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But in the meantime there was, you couldn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , so I stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> and I have to say something to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I want to make two points very important that in my life I became an orphan twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Once I lost my father and mother, and the next time I lost my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> didn't want me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">To <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> I couldn't go, and a person without a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s like a child without a father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I absolutely had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">It puzzles me till today why nobody picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They didn't teach us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I was on my...like five years of suffering, six years was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I had to suffer another few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">But I was married to my wife and my wife had a mother, a wonderful person, and to me to ever been have, able to have a mother was a very important thing, and I was told to make myself a displaced person as . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">That's a displaced person cou...without a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> written up that I had survived, that I was less than twenty years old, that I was an orphan, but because I was married that statue, that uh quota fell through because I was married already. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But uh lucky that in 1948 towards the end, Truman signed a two hundred thousand quota of displaced persons, and in '48 my wife became pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">When she became pregnant, I became terrible impatient. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I didn't want a child of mine to be born in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So I went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> and I asked the consul, there was always German girls working in the <span class="BUILDING">consul</span> , when you get to the consul, so I would bribe them with some chocolate or some cigarettes and they would always say to me, Mr. Her Pantirer, your papers are a little bit higher, from the bottom a little bit higher, a little higher. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And sure enough, at the end of '48, I was called with my wife from the very first on the quota to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and in '49, January 17th, we stayed in '48 a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhaufen</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bre...Bremenhaufen</span> we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , SS Marine Fletcher (ph) and January 4th or 5th happened to be our anniversary - I told my wife take out a suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We're going to dance on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but I was so sick - she says that I was begging for a little dry ice, but I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I had, I had feelings in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that I I came to the nght <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and if everybody who works can make a living, I pride myself that I can do anything and be able to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And 1n beginning, in '49, of course in July 6th my son was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">My wife's mother and sister came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in August, and I work in <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I I was a floor boy on in <span class="BUILDING">garment center</span> , but to help myself a little bit I used to go in in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> for sweaters and buy off a few gross of sweaters and buying like uh two for a dollar, and I would sell one for a dollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So I helped myself a little bit but I had no trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Was very hard for me, so I had an opportunity and I decided in 1950 to become a builder. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I have to make a point here, that in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> trade I work harder in my business than I worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">To show you the logic things from a person, regardless if you stand with a gun, if he has nothing from the work and you don't feel like working, nothing can make you. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But with the work that I did in <span class="BUILDING">mine building business</span> , I knew, I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night, like ten o'clock at night, and I was tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I found out for the first time that when you're tired you cannot have your dinner, but I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I knew I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my wife, to a child and I dedicated my life towards my children, to build a better <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And that way I was awarded, I was rewarded that uh not only I get a better life for my children but for myself and I did it with all my heart and I'm very thankful to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that gave me all that opportunity and I can only speak to the young people who never lost their freedom - guard your freedom very strongly. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">God bless <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It's a wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Has certain faults but like everyone has, but it's a beautiful, a wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and and I have to tell you that I was confused in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I didn't know bring up the children Jewish, not bring them up Jewish and I said to myself, if Hitler and his Nazi party, and they are still many Nazi guys, will say we tried to kill off Murray Pantirer. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We didn't want nobody to survive from his family, but now that he survived, he killed himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He didn't bring up the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He didn't bring up the Jewish family, so it's not a victory for me, but it's a victory for the Jewish people that uh I brought up my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I've three wonderful children, a son and two daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They're married, three wonderful children, so I have six - I have no difference between mine son-in-law or daughter-in-law and of course they produced for me nine grandchildren that I'm very proud of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They're very Jewish-minded, and I want to say if two things it's important to learn from the Holocaust - our President J. F. Kennedy said, if you fooled me once, shame on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">You are bad boys and you fooled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">But if you fooled me twice, shame on me that I'm going to let myself be fooled. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So we, the Jewish people, always have to be vigilant and always like they saying in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> of the best thing - nip it in the bud. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Cut it, when immediately, don't make say , crazy guy does not pay attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Be always alert. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But above everything, we must have a State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I am convinced without, with all my heart and all my belief, had we had a State of Israel in '35, '38, '39, even '40, many, many of us could have escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Many of us would have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I watch now which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> takes in their people without checking their health, their wealth, they, how old they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="716"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> opens up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for every Jew in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So this way we have to make sure that we learn and we teach our children about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">As painful as it is and it's almost unbelievable - the story has to be told. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And if the story for the sake of my suffering and my losses, 1f I can bring up a better world for one human being - never mind for a whole generation - it's worthwhile to teach, because on our skin we learned so make a better world for any other people, regardless of color, creed, religion - every human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We see now how many doctors and lawyers, how ma...how we brought up our children, how many valuable people. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So you never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">When you kill off a person, you kill off a generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And that, the free world should never allow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And if uh if I have a minute, if you permit me a few minutes, I want to talk a little bit about <span class="COUNTRY">United Germany</span> .</span></p>
