<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I'd like you to start off by telling me your name at the time of war years, and where you were born, and the date of your birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I am Raphael Aronson, also known as a nickname, Folia. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born on June 21, 1919 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kuanas</span> , also known as Kovno, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  I'd like to start by just learning a little bit about Kovno before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">What kind of life was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Tell me a little bit about your family, what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  We were three brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father was an engineer, mostly involved in importing advanced engineering systems from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Systems, he introduced to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , central heating systems. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Also, he introduced processing of meat in sausages and things for food industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was a quite successful businessman until <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> changed their political situation, I should say Hitler started to become active. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Then the Germany companies didn't want to deal anymore with him, or he didn't want to deal with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Then he switched around in importing different building materials for construction industry, such as material known as , which now is manufactured in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> by . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was a heavy smoker, and developed lung cancer and passed away in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She was a pharmacist, but she never practiced as a pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She was involved in bringing up the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My older brother is -- after the war he was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , but right now, for the last five years, he is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He attended the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He was also a construction engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He had a hobby as a glider, and he was a member of a gliding club in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Mostly Lithuanians belonged there. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There were one or two Jews, and he was fairly accepted in this gliding society. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He published a magazine about gliding as a hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He learned somehow English, and he had ability to translate these magazines published in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> into Lithuanian language. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And this was mostly part of his magazine which published in the Lithuania language. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My younger brother, David, he was born in 1921, and after my father passed away he emigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">As a matter of fact, at that time I was going also, me and my mother were going also, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I couldn't get a permit, because I was an officer in the Lithuanian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I just graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Officersâ€™ School</span> , and the Lithuanian Government had certain rules that I had to stay three years in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> until I could leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, why was -- did everybody go into the Lithuanian Army? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Did all the Jewish boys go 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  The Lithuanian Army everybody at age of 17 or 18, I don't recall, had to go into the Army, but I didn't go into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Military School</span> , just like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">There was a certain way to do it, but after graduation you go immediately into the Reserve. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I chose to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There were very few Jewish people who did it, but after I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I just felt that I'm not ready for the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I didn't know what to do with myself, and I applied, and I was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Were the Jewish people in the Army treated the same way as everyone else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Probably not. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There were three of us Jews that were not part of the complete society. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And Lithuanians are not intellectually advanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They are mostly farmers, not very educated, and they looked at a Jew as a foreigner who doesn't belong in this society, in spite of the fact that there were quite few prominent Jews in the Army, very limited, who were colonels or one was a general, but they mostly were connected with medical services through the Army, but not the organization or things of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Now, you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  No, we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Actually, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> was a capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , not suburbs, part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , but close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We had to cross a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> was known as what's called left side of the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Usually people who are not very well to do used to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It's the poor section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">This applied- there was a very high percentage of Jewish population, but also non-Jews lived there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> itself, did you mix with non-Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  My family was -- I wouldn't call orthodox religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were traditionally religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They celebrated all holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We didn't go every Saturday or Friday to a <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father was more religious, because my father graduated from a Jewish Hader (ph), which is a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish religious school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But my mother didn't know how to read or write in Jewish, or in Hebrew, because, like I say, she graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">She spoke Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">As a matter of fact, our language at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was Russian, not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Jewish population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> did not mix with Lithuanians or very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I don't know how it happened that I was the exception to the rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The majority of youngsters went to Hebrew or to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian high school</span> , which all subjects were taught in Lithuanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We had, I believe, once a month, a Jewish religion class, which was make believe situation just to comply with certain rules and regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">After graduation, as I stated, I went to this <span class="BUILDING">military school</span> , which was mostly non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There were three or four Jews, and then I attended the <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So, I had quite a sizable exposure to Lithuanians and all nationality Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Did you get along well with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Did you experience any anti-semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There were -- I mean, non-Lithuanians were anti-semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were hiding it, but as a rule things were changing in the '30s, the early '30s, 1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They were changing different laws and regulation to such to take away all wealth and ability to do business from Jewish population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  In the early 30s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  The early 30s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Actually, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , just going back, became independent in 1918 after the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">At that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , in origin, people who could create <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> didn't exist, so they asked Jewish people to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So a Jewish warrior by the name of Hrobison (ph) I believe Hrobison, I'm not sure, wrote the first constitution for <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In the same year Hrobinson, later on when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> became independent, he also helped to create the first Israel constitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There were many prominent Jewish people in the Lithuanian government at the time, except the President was not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Slowly, once we got the feel of an independent <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they started to eliminated the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Lithuanians were never involved in any trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">All trade was controlled by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Slowly, they were issued different rules or directives to eliminate Jews or to create Lithuanian companies which, for certain religious reasons which Jews didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But in spite of this, Jewish population, or part of the Jewish population, was fairly comfortable at <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They were professional people. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then there were a percentage of Jewish people who are not comfortable, just like any other <span class="REGION">European country</span> or <span class="REGION">eastern country</span> or western.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Were you aware of what was going in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with Hitler and the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We knew all of what was happening, but people were very naive at that time, and they said it's fine, it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it's not in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But everybody was very much concerned and tried to do something, but nobody knew what to do because for one, iten one; they were comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were established and somehow they didn't feel like separating from everything that they had created in their lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Some people, many left <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , not many -- I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Maybe one or two percent of Jewish people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Just for example, my brother left, and we were going to leave, but we couldn't as I stated before. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Just an example, when German came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and started the atrocities of killing Jews, many Polish Jews came to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At that time there was <span class="BUILDING">Japanese consulate</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , who I don't know the reason why, was giving out Visas for Jews to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And there were huge <span class="DLF">lines</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> to obtain a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And this was mostly Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Very few Lithuanian Jews were there, because Polish Jews had already the experience of being under Nazi occupation for a relatively short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Lithuanian Jews, probably they didn't think this was the right thing to do or were not ready to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But I just recently was in Europe and read an article about it, this week, and it was described in detail what happened to this Japanese Consul, I forget, I believe his name is, and the people who obtained visas mostly were Polish Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Were you involved in any political organizations while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  I belonged to a student fraternity which was right wing, the fraternity was EL AL, which was right wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We followed the leader who was Trobotinsky (ph), and it was just a student fraternity. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We had political involvement, social involvement, just like any other fraternity, and probably I was a right winger not a left winger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Why did you join this, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Because I had to join -- I mean it was very customary for students, university students, Jewish, to join <span class="BUILDING">fraternities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There were three <span class="BUILDING">fraternities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">This one was left wing, which had belief in being left. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">One was something in between and many of my friends were in this El Al fraternity, and that's where I went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  But you were concerned about the principles that Trobotinsky (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Yes, I believed in it to a certain -- I didn't believe in what's called Jewish Socialists, or left wingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I didn't believe in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I believed more in the right wing, with Trobinski (ph) or what was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batar</span> (ph), and I believe it was a goal to achieve a better life for Jews was better following Trobinski or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batar</span> , as compared to left wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Or there were quite a few Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> who are Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Communist was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">There was a particular movement of communist in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and a high percentage of members were Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  The reason I'm asking is that it sounds like your family had a fairly comfortable life style, and you were not highly religious and yet you were following -- you were concerned about the future of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Yes, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I don't believe it can be limited to future of Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were always talking about Jews as a nation, not only <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We never referred that Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> should be better off or concerned about Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We always talked about Jews as a nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And speaking about their comfort, yes, we were comfortable until '34 or '35. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">At that time, my father already -- Hitler was already in Germany-- he already, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he couldn't do business with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">At the same time, he already had certain problems with his health because of smoking, which he never stopped smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Then things started to go down, and when war started and the Communists came in, which was in 1940, then we were just existing. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We were not poor, but we were not well to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  I do want to ask you about how things changed with the Communists, but I think first I just want to get more of a sense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Konov</span> before the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Culturally, what the life was like there, was there a lot of opportunity? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Was there a good life for a Jewish boy like yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Actually, there existed a certain opportunity for an educated Jew, like myself, at that time I was probably 20, 22, 23. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was born in '18, we're talking about '37, '38 and I was 23 years old or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Young people of my generation had many possibilities, because first there were families in certain businesses which always, the children used to take over the business from the father. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Second, many professional people were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Doctors were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Many lawyers were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Many nurses were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish factories</span> , big <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> producing rubber products like rubber boots and rubber coats into rubber in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There were <span class="BUILDING">salt factories</span> which produced bakeries. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Industry was fairly much controlled -- not controlled, but it was very represented by Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So, there existed opportunity as far as for a Jewish doctor, it was much more difficult to obtain a license to be a doctor as compared to Lithuanian Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You have to know somebody, you have to bribe, like in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or any <span class="REGION">European country</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Bribing or knowing somebody was very important way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Even going into the Army certain people, Jewish again, did not want to go to the Army because they could afford, they could pay off to somebody to say they were not physically capable to be enlisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">There was, I believe he was a colonel, who was in charge of army medical services, top man, and he was a Lithuanian, but he married a Jewish -- his wife was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I didn't know it, but now I found out that he was accepting bribes to issue certificates that a Jewish fellow has certain problems, physical problems, medical problems, and he must excuse him in joining the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, as far as opportunity, yes, but many Jews of my generation, if they could afford, left <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> temporarily to attend <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> or get education or get experience overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and right now they are back -- many are back in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">They came somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But, some of them were, during the war, were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because they left just before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">The went to <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> during the war, and everybody had a dream to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and go someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Naturally, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was one of the favorable <span class="NPIP">places</span> to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Did you have an active social life? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Were there a lot of cultural activities you took advantage of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  The Jewish type?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Any type, I want to know about Kovno.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yes, Kovno had a fairly prominent <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was a prominent singer by the name of Petroskauf (ph), who was a good friend of a very famous singer, Sholapkin (ph), a short fellow who -- I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Sholapkin, this second series to visit this famous terror of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and to participate in operas. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Opera was central for social activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There were <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theater</span> was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian theaters</span> I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There were movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">There was a <span class="BUILDING">School of Medicine</span> and another <span class="BUILDING">University Engineering School</span> and Economics School. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Lithuanians had their own societies and their social organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There were Lithuanian writers which were promoted by Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">In my opinion, they were not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Actually, going back to the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , in 1430, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> had a very powerful king who occupied the whole of Europe from the <span class="REGION">Baltic Sea</span> to the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Then he married a woman who was of Polish origin, and she dropped him and married the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And then the whole <span class="REGION">territory</span> that was acquired by the Lithuania King had become part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">From this point on, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was never an independent country. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The next independence that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was in 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  I'm trying to get a sense of how you spent your leisure time. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Were there nice memories before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  As being a youngster or in general population of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  You?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  As a youngster I participated in different sport activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I was a referee of a basketball team. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">At one time, there was basketball match in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> that all of Europe participated and <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> took first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because they imported all Lithuania basketball players from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There was only one player who was Lithuanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We watched -- we spent a lot of time in this <span class="BUILDING">sport complex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There was tennis and skiing 1n winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Summer we used to go away in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , rent a <span class="BUILDING">bungalow</span> as a family, my mothers and my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My uncle, who his wife was my mother's sister, had a huge <span class="DLF">farm</span> not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , probably 10 miles, 15 miles away, and we used to go there and spend a lot of time at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and do activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">That's the extent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I was a person that was always busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I was never bored. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Until I went to <span class="BUILDING">military school</span> , I was involved in going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which requires homework and things of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Did you ever go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Was there any reason to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  After -- when I joined Alile(ph), and when I was a student at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , somehow I used to go because there were certain people who used to live on the shore of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> , just as you cross a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , rabbis mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And a certain rabbi's daughter was part of our young society, and I remember she had a wedding, she was married at her father's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , who had a big <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Maybe I was a few times, but it simply wasn't what I chose to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I was pretty sure I was there many times -- not many times - three, four, five, ten times. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I just don't recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  The reason I was asking was, I know that that was a real center of Jewish life, but it's obviously something that you were not that involved with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  No, like the Jews Talmud studying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which I was not involved in such activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  I want to ask you one more question, and then we need to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Because you were involved, or you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with a lot of Lithuanians, you were in the military with a lot of Lithuanians, did you personally experience anti-semitism before the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  I wish I could say yes, I did, but I cannot recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I had a few Lithuanian friends, which we were friends in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , especially in the higher grades of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">At the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , I spoke only to a few Lithuanians who asked me certain questions because I was good in mathematics, better than average, and they asked me how to solve this problem or this problem, which I told them and this was the extent of our contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  So your friends were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  No, about half, half. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I knew people, but friends is something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I had two or three Lithuanian friends and maybe four or five close Jewish friends, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I was in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was an uprising in '35 or '36, I don't recall, where there was a right wing - End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  You were starting to tell me about this uprising in the mid 1930s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">In late 1930s there was Lithuanians in the fraternity, which were very right wingers, and they started to introduce different difficulties as related to Jewish students. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They started to beat up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , Jewish youngsters, and the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> introduced -- or they did not introduce -- but they forced Jewish people to sit on the top of the <span class="BUILDING">auditoriums</span> , the last two or three rows of the <span class="BUILDING">auditoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And whoever did not comply with their request was written up. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And some were badly beaten up and had to be taken out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Also, they introduced, or they enforced, certain requirements that Jews between them should not speak Jewish at the <span class="DLF">University grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Only the Lithuanian language should be used. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">At that time, it became a not a very favorable <span class="NPIP">place</span> for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They were not equal with all students. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">As time progressed, the Lithuanian fraternity on this organization, which there were two, one was part , the second was a student organization, they became more and more powerful and attracted more and more members, and they were very instrumental later on when Hitler or Germans walked into <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Things changed probably in '34 '35.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  How did life change under Russian occupation, was that noticeable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Yes, very much so, because it was a very slow process, a gradual process, and things changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">First to start with, they closed up all Jewish fraternities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Could you start over and say when that was when the Russians took over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">When the Russians came to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> after some agreement was made between Russian, <span class="COUNTRY">USSR</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the Red Army came to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and nobody realized what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">First they were met with flowers and everybody was very happy that the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Gradually they changed the way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">First they closed up all religious -- not religious -- fraternities which relates to Jewish activities or religious activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They introduced, for example, Russian language and Russian Communist history in all <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They reorganized school systems. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They deported the majority of successful business people from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , and between them there were quite a high percentage of Jewish people who owned business and were prosperous and active in social life of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> before they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Then they started to take over businesses and real estate, and major changes took place very similar to -- eventually became a way of life in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> very similar to way of life in <span class="COUNTRY">USSR</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">At that time, the young generation, which is my generation and my wife's generation, which is people between 16 and 22, something like this, probably felt a certain freedom came in, and they were living up the freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They started to party and enjoying themselves, and they didn't give a damn what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Suddenly a lot of business activity disappeared for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Their parents didn't talk about how to build up the business, how to create something more, how to open another <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , or whatever the case may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Memories of this era are regretfully, especially my wife's memory, who was younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was a year of freedom and partying, and she has good memories of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  I would just stop you a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You were telling me that actually when the Russians came in, there seemed to be less, maybe less structure, less formalities, but for your young people, it was liberating in a way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  That probably is correct, because somehow in the very beginning, Jews felt that Russians came in, and they should not be concerned anymore regarding anti-semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They were completely wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Several became equal with everybody else, and they felt that their way of life at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> became much easier because their parents or relatives were not involved and concerned anymore about their business because business was taken away from them from bigger businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Somehow, I think for the young generation, life became easier in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Later on, things changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Certain people advanced because of Russians being in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Certain people went all the way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It changed the balance of the society.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Now, did it change the balance for you in a positive or negative way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  For me, it changed -- it's difficult to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I missed the fraternity and fraternal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And then everybody got involved and became a better student in the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> because somehow it was a feeling that if you have enough education you'll succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">In the very beginning, before the Russians came in, success was prosperity, how prosperous and successful your parents' business. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Education was very important at that time also, but here you became independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You couldn't depend any more on what your parents' had or will have. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">You had to create your own <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> in the society. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">In order to do it, you should have education. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So, everybody got involved and became a better student, studied more to get better marks and graduate sooner. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">That's what I recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Tell me about the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Do you remember the day the Germans came 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">The Germans just --they didn't come in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , but they crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> on the day of my birthday, which was June 21st -- I was born on June 21st -- in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Then we went out with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We were going to a nightclub party, and they were coming in around 2:00 in the morning or maybe 3:00, because it was getting daylight and all you see from the <span class="DLF">skies</span> 1s falling down like pieces of burnt paper or something of this nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We didn't know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We thought somebody threw something out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The next morning, suddenly all <span class="DLF">streets</span> were full of Red Army running and moving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , and all <span class="DLF">streets</span> were just loaded with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">There were some that were barefoot running, some on <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , all kinds of means of transportation, and they were just running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Germans were already across the <span class="DLF">border</span> between what's called Memau (ph), which was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , which <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> took away before. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And nobody knew what was happening because there was no communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The radio didn't work, nothing worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The telephone, I believe, worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I believe we tried to get some information by telephone, but 1t was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We couldn't get any information. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I'm not sure if it was the same day or the next day, there was no Germans still not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , but the Lithuanian right wingers opened the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and let out all prisoners from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">These were all types of whatever people were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , murderers, and whatever you want, and they got weapons, and they distributed the white ribbons to Lithuanians, and this was in celebration of the Army of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And the first task of this liberation army was to kill Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And they went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> , and then from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> trying to kill many, many Jews, I don't how many thousands, just kill them, chase them out from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , took away their possession and there was no law at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Then they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kuanas</span> across a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and again was going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they selected three hundred most prominent Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kuanas</span> , and put them in what's called -- this was called a huge <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> where this bath system is stored, a <span class="BUILDING">maintenance garage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And they said you will be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The German government will promote you to be in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> , whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The next thing, they came with rifles and killed all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So, actually Lithuanian Jewish Society was the leaders of this community. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Then they continued going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They came in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which we lived in front of a multi story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , not multi story, maybe five story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and back, it was like a one story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They killed quite a few people in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Then they came to our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They walked in, and I put on such an emblems that I am an Officer of the Lithuanian Army, and I said, "What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I am an officer of the Lithuanian Army, you pay attention to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They were standing with the rifles and taking us away to kills us, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Then the caretaker, or the person who took care of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> came to our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , superintendent he's probably called, came in and said, "What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">These are nice people, these are nice Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Leave them alone." </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So they never touched anybody, and at that time they turned around and walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So this was the end of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Then in the next few days, the German Army moved tn, and they issued the white arm bands, not to lay down the weapons and follow only rules and regulation which German Government Occupation had issued, that is was illegal to go from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Then the Germans gave a systematic way how to eliminate Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Actually, there was no more fear that somebody would knock at your <span class="DLF">door</span> and kill you, but there was rules in the next month or so, all Jews should move out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> and move into this specific <span class="REGION">area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> , which was the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Before we get to that, the Lithuanians who were running around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> , going in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , beating up on Jews, do you think they were under German supervision or they were just doing it on their own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  My feeling is that they did it on their own, because this was this organization, this right wing organization, which was fraternity was a sport club, was very much right wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Then they joined all these people who were let out from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But people who were in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , the majority were right wingers because the Russians put them in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And the Russians came into <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> everybody who didn't like the Russians are in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , mostly Lithuanians put them in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321"><span class="BUILDING">Jail</span> was loaded with so-called right wingers, Lithuanians who, really it's just like if you let out an animal from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span> , they are overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Here they let them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They open the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , give them rifles, go, and they were just running and all others joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">When a mass movement starts, there are many joiners. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Anybody who wanted could pick up a white handkerchief around his arm and join them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Were you watching any of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I mean did you actually see any of the beatings or shootings or whatever?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, because you couldn't miss it, you couldn't miss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  I saw that they had come and beat up a Jew and let him laying on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I didn't see a shooting frankly. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">At least I don't recall, but beating, I saw all the time during this several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">As a matter of fact, my brother, who worked for some company, engineering company, older brother, just felt that he should go back to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> after -- it was Monday, the 22nd of June, and he came to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and his best friend with whom they worked together on a certain project says, "I'm glad you are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You are under arrest." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And they picked him up and put him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> where he worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Somehow, he escaped from there, because he tied a white handkerchief around his arm, and he didn't look too Jewish, so he escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And he was hiding for maybe two weeks, because he was always afraid they would come and look for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  Didn't you wonder where he was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Sure, but that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I just wonder. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I got a notice before the 21st from the Lithuanian Government that I should report to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> as active duty as a lieutenant and this date was the 22nd. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The 22nd was Monday, the 21st was Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I should report to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be reenlisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I called this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and there was no answer on Monday, and nobody knew what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So, I decided to go to take myself to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and see what -- because I was afraid if I don't report something will happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I came to the last <span class="DLF">door</span> and knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and nobody answered, and I turned around and went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But as I walked there and back, I was very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">If I saw somebody with white arms, I was going in the corner of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I knew something could happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">As a matter of fact, my mother told me please don't go, don't go, but I just felt I should.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Your family was very frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, especially my mother because my father was already dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He died in '38, '37.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Were you thinking about making any plans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  At that time, it was already too late to make any plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Some people managed to make plans even then to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , or some went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Some went, somehow managed to go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and go to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There were a limited amount of people found ways and means how to escape, but very, very few, very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Now, I read that really the first few days before the Germans even came in, people were being rounded up and taken out to, I guess, the forts and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Thousands of people in the first few days were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Do you know anything about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  Sure, sure they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">This was mostly people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The numbers were something like 7,000 of Jews, and they were taken, not to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> was established later on by Germans in collaborations with Lithuanians as a major killing spot for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But there was another <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Seven Fort</span> , which was just an intersection of two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They used to take Jews in the very beginning right there and kill them, in that <span class="BUILDING">Seven Fort</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Did you know about this at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  Is this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  No, I didn't know at that time, actually, probably I found out more about it being here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> than in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , because everybody knew that the Jews were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Where and how they were killed was not known at that time because we were moved from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and yet everybody was disengaged from his everyday existence, a new existence, accommodations were very meager. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They were preoccupied to create the best they can under existing circumstances, and they just knew that many Jews were killed, but they didn't talk about it, the where and how. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Later on, it started slowly, and then after the end of the war when the facts were available became known.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  These killings were in , outside of <span class="BUILDING">Seven Fort</span> , in ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  No, these were just Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">These right wingers, I call them right wingers, is a cross section of Lithuanians who wanted financial benefit by doing it, or they hated Jews, or they got a kick out of doing it because Lithuanians probably became later on -- Germans really liked Lithuanians because they were professional Jew killers, and they used to not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> but also in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Now, it was still a little over a month before you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">What were you doing in that month? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Did life kind of stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Trying to get as much information as we could to find out what's happening, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">What Germans -- how do we exist, how do we live under German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">What will be next step. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And every day there seemed to be new announcements by German Government regulations related to Jews, and was posted all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> , from today on all Jews should have to say Heil Hitler or wear a patch, and who doesn't have it will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Next thing came out were regulations that all Jews should not walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , should walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">It's not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Any <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> which still exit that belong to Jews should put a big sign in front that this <span class="BUILDING">business</span> belongs to a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And the Jews should not attend any <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">There were all kinds of rules and regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Everyday was something new, and this was anticipation like today you put on the radio to see news. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Here, every morning, you run out to see what the new announcement hangs on the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> or on -- and every day or every second it was always something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Then it was a request to turn in all gold and valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It became illegal to possess gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It was a very gradual process, an organized gradual process. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">This kept you busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Was there a feeling of you know, violence, I mean were you afraid when you went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  If you complied with directives which are posted, probably you could walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> nobody would touch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">If you didn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , if you had a yellow star and as arule, basically by memory, you could walk out -- nobody felt safe, let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But, if you were within all of the directives that the Germans issued, you were mobile, you could go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy bread or do things of this nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And everybody was living in anticipation of what's next, and next came moving to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  How did the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  I believe one morning they posted a notice that all Jews should move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> , and they organized a Jewish relocation committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Who organized a committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  The Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I don't recall who was on the relocation committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But then this relocation committee also established certain relocation consultants, I don't know how they call it, and I was part of them, because the only reason I say they assigned me was because I was a lieutenant in the Lithuanian Army and there were five or six Jewish youngsters, the same as me. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Then they proceeded to tell me that here on this <span class="DLF">street</span> in the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> that these families should be relocated in these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I had this list, and I go up to these people and say you'll be moving to this <span class="DLF">street</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at this number. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">This took maybe two weeks or three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Actually a relocation of where Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I'm not sure how long, but it would be safe statement that the period was one month. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I just -- I'm not sure if it was one month or three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And during this period there was not too many means of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , actually horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> or wheel barrows or things of this nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The majority of people left the bulk of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> or posessions in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> consisted of two sections, the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and Small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Everybody was assigned <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">This location which was assigned for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> used to be occupied mostly by Lithuanians, not by Jews and probably Lithuanians, I'm not sure, paid for the <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and things because they moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">They were very cheap, inexpensive private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The majority, which had two, three four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was assigned to a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">In addition, there were two high rise <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> which <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> built for government subsidy for poor people -- Lithuanian poor people. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">These, two huge, we used to call it blocks, <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> were also occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">In each <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was three or four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which in each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> would be one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Eventually, everybody was moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and to once they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> , they organized working brigades which is one way they go to work, manual work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and then we'll talk about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It sounds like the effort to get in was fairly organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">People didn't take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , but they were able to take a lot of their belongings, their books?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Yes, some people even took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> who could afford it, because they still had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Money could do many things, or hidden gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They used to bribe or pay Lithuanians to provide better means of transportation and these could take their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Not everybody, but a small percentage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  So, there was an effort to get all books in and people preserve their --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">They took as much as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Tell me about where you were living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , one very small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and one is like a bigger <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was on one of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">There was an <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> , and I don't recall if there was running water or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Frankly, I don't recall, probably not. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we brought our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> to sleep and pots and pans and clothes and books, albums, things that were of certain value to us as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">That's about all I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">My brother was married, my older brother, and he was with his wife and my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Somehow we got two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> because probably we knew somebody, because one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was my brother and his wife used to stay in a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">It was not - it was not in comparison to what we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovnov</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But we slept well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  You are an architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">What did the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> look like? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I know there were two parts and you were living in the larger part at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  What did it look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  It looked like if you see the movies today, western type movies, you see the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the <span class="DLF">streets</span> are not paved, and both sides of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> are <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , wooden <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , not very fancy, fairly run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">There were some <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , not fancy, without any <span class="DLF">store windows</span> and no lights on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It's a fairly primitive <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">There was nothing fancy about it, except the two <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> which were built. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They were built of brick, no finishes, and no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was probably eight stories high, seven stories high, and you had to go up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , seven floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It had running water, I believe, these <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> , but the majority of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> didn't have, all it had was <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They didn't have running water, I'm pretty sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Were you allowed to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> built of barbed wire, and there were guards walking around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and there was only one <span class="DLF">gate</span> to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">This <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open to let out this working brigade in the morning to go to work and to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Everybody when they come back were searched to make sure he didn't bring anything into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And the guards around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> were mostly Lithuanians with rifles in case somebody wants to climb over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , if he could, they'll come down the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was just like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , like a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  You were sent out on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">work brigades</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Personally, no in the beginning I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">In the beginning, I was assigned like public works to make sure the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are properly paved and passable and other facilities are in good working condition, probably because I had an engineering background, construction background. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And then they assigned to me some twenty people or more, I don't recall, mostly elderly people, because they couldn't -- they were not useful to go out and work manual work. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And probably they fix the <span class="DLF">road</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> not because they wanted Jews to have a better <span class="DLF">road</span> , but because they wanted this <span class="DLF">road</span> passable for Germans in case they come in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> so they can pass and collect the Jews whatever, as the case may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That's what I did in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Later on, based on my memory, probably <span class="DLF">roads</span> were passable. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Then I was assigned to a certain brigade to work, which was to load lumber into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barges</span> into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> someplace and to unload it. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">That's where I met my wife, because she was in the same brigade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Where were you -- you were loading and unloading this lumber?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes, it's wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">In <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they cut the wood and load on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barges</span> and bring it to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , where they cut it into lumber and boards and planks, whatever the case may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  How did you meet your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  I mean I was assigned, actually each brigade had a leader, and I became the leader of this brigade and this brigade had probably 30 women and 30 men working. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And she was one of the 30 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And we had a certain advantage because we used to go out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where they used to cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and there were farmers, and since they were farmers somehow we made a deal with the farmers giving them our clothes that we didn't use or gold or valuables, and they used to bring us and give us food, like big bag of potatoes or flour or baked bread or whatever the case may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Then I probably met my present wife at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Since I was the leader of this group, I say we need two or three people who should distribute equally whatever it was from the farmers to each person, because you bring a bag of potatoes, each person got four or five potatoes or whatever to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I had assigned her to be in charge of distributing this food. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">She and another two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And, I then got closer and closer to her because I used to come and say how are you doing, and eventually I used to meet her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and eventually decided to marry her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Well, it's a nice story in the midst of all of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Yes, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Was the work vigorous? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Was it real hard work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It was hard, but to be very honest, was not as hard as other brigades because -- the worst <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work used to be the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , Germans built a new <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> next to the existing <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and there people used to come and dig and carry stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it was very, very hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Not a good working environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Many people used to die working at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> or killed because the guards were not very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">This was a huge brigade, some thousand, twelve hundred people to a unit, and I don't know how many people were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , but we used to go out three or four brigades to work at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">This was the worst <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Our <span class="NPIP">place</span> was also hard work, but it was a better environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Somehow the guards who watched us were also more human, because they used to go away from big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and some nights we used to sleep over in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because we used to go to with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">There's a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> 1s, and it used to take a day or longer, and they used to sleep there someplace in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And then at night we used to load up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barges</span> and go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> are. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It was -- we didn't have to work continuously, because once you are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> you don't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So, it was a more relaxed situation as compared to other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brigades</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Probably others were in similar situations, but it's just a question of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But, the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> was the worst.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Did you work at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Only a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Maybe a week or two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I don't remember how long, but I worked there after this public works was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Then I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> for a certain period of time, and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was such a relationship between the Ghetto administration and people who worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And administration which would come later on was this Dr. Elkous (ph), and then there was this other person who was, prior we knew from before the war, friends of our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I went to complain to them, say I don't want to go to work at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , maybe you can do something to reassign me to work someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And then they make me this leader of this group to pick up <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , lumber. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">There was a certain period when I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Any other work brigades you were part of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  You brought up Doctor Elkous in the consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Tell me a little bit about how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was run, how it was operated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  I mean the Germans organized Ghetto administration and the leader of this administration was Dr. Elkous. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Now why Dr. Elkous, I don't know how they found him. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I just don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Then this committee that worked under him, there were different people, there was one lawyer who was his right hand man. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There was one person who was in charge -- it was called some Arbitza (ph) labor department, who was assigned people. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Germans used to say that we need a brigade of twelve hundred people to do this type of work, so he selected, made a list who are these twelve hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Or like in my case this 60 people, he made the list, who are the 60 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And he was not a very honest person. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Not a very liked person, because he used to take bribes from people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They would say assign me to a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> I organize for you, I have a pound of butter or whatever the case may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So, he was by many people disliked, but some liked him, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Elkous was a very honest person and a good leader, and he believed that under his leadership he should negotiate with Germans to get the best possible condition for Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And to his team he was a lawyer and to other people --. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Then the Jewish police, this was also the police chief, was precincts, I believe three <span class="REGION">precincts</span> and chief of the precincts and kept the police organization, who were on the surface, they executed orders from Germans, But at the same time, there was a certain amount of underground work where they did not -- they helped the Jewish population and tried to make it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">As a matter of fact, Jewish police leadership was killed one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They felt that there was something going on, and so they took all the Jewish police chiefs and the chiefs of the precincts and kept whoever was in charge, about twenty-five people I believe, and took them to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> and shoot them, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And they appointed a new leadership of the Ghetto police, which I believe was also disposed, the second one was disposed, I believe, based on my memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  How were the police and the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> chosen? </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Were they chosen by the Jewish community or were they chosen by the German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  Basically, appointed, probably by Jewish Elkous group, probably or maybe with consultation with Germans -- I mean leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Regular policemen were just selected by the Administration, the Ghetto Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  How was the Ghetto Administration selected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  This I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Like Dr. Elkous and all of his people, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I don't recall how. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But they were probably appointed by Germans in conjunction with Lithuanians and groups that knew Jewish communities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and probably Germans talked to them and said who should be the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Who would be a responsible person and speaks good German because Elkous graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">School of Medicine</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He spoke good German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  What were some of the responsibilities of the Jewish Consul? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">What were their importance to the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  Actually, they were running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and their obligation was to comply with directive which they get from occupation from Germans and to execute it. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Now, once they get it, we negotiate with them and try to change certain small details to make it easier for a Jewish population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Otherwise, they used to have public sports and Jewish services, religious services, they taught in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , not <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for children, at <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> there was a place where they used to -- there was a certain industry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , to produce certain items or to fix up German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They organized this industry, and they were just like any other government except there was no power like in democracy, you have a Congress, representatives by people, but here nobody was elected by people, they had to follow just directives they get from Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But if this was within the scope of the directive the German list would provide, then they organized a standard way of life for a community, <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and welfare and food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  So, in a certain way, it sounds like most of the activities that you would have had before the war, you still had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">What activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Well, you had some <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and you had --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  No, we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which was a very primitive <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were in somebody's else <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , were little <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">There were ten kids or so, youngsters, just to come and some person who didn't go to work or after work they could teach them. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It was not an organized school system. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was an organized <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Food distribution was brought in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , bread I believe, there were others, potatoes and was equally distributed between population. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish bakery</span> , only one which was to take flour and bake bread in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was a <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> which used to bring meat and cut up meat in small portions and distribute to the population based on -- everybody used to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">That was the extent of the activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">There was very little cultural activity as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">There was just work, go to work, get up in the morning, come back from work and try to figure out how to do the best from which you've got, to prepare a meal so that you will not be hungry for the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Was there any <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , music or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Sometimes the Jewish people, usually get together in a group to sing, and then there were Jewish musicians who were musicians before Ghetto time, they used to get together and give a concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">People used to listen on Sundays, I believe Sundays, and get together and give a concert and play. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">One thing which was very unique in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , I just remembered, during Sundays, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was on the shore of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and there was like a little <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">It was off limits to go out and use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">At one time, this consul, the consul negotiated with the Germans, and they allowed to open the <span class="DLF">beach</span> for the Jewish people on Sunday to go for two or three hours and everybody used to come and go for a swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Because there was only one <span class="INT_SPACE">public bath</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and you really had to wait in <span class="DLF">line</span> to go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So, we used to go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  So, did you go down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> once or was it every week?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  For a short period of time it was every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I don't know for how long, but this was for half a year or a year, but summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But this was something new and something that younger people looked forward to doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  We were talking about activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Did people observe the Jewish holidays? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Was the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> open, the <span class="BUILDING">Shul</span> (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Yes, they observed the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , as they became more religious and conscious as they are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">There was one small <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , but then there was a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , across the consul where Dr. Elkous was, <span class="DLF">Village Square</span> , and there was a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> which was all public services were available. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">The barber was there, and a notary, which somebody used to get married used to come there, and they would issue certain pieces of papers that you are married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  Is that where you got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And somebody died, I mean all of the statistical or public records were kept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">This would also be at <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> during Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">People used to come there, but in addition was a small <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  Did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Maybe I went once or twice, but I was not there every holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Now, you mentioned that the Jewish police were helpful to the underground movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Tell me a little bit about the underground movement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  I frankly, I was not part of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">My brother was very active in the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">He was to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> because he didn't look too Jewish and go to different Lithuanian organizations and used to copy maps where Germans are, <span class="DLF">German installations</span> , and things of this nature, and bring it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and give it to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Underground was very secretive to such an extent that all people were divided into groups of five and nobody knew who else -- you knew these five people, but you didn't know anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Also, if somebody used to talk about underground with other people, this was -- he could be killed by underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There were many people killed by underground because they talked to other people what's happening in underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , I didn't have too much exposure, in spite of the fact that my brother was part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">One time he was coming back from his trip to outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , which he had to race to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> in some <span class="DLF">opening</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and he was caught by a German and beaten up and placed in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The Germans had a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> at the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But somehow he run away from it and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I knew that he was missing for a week or two weeks, but he wouldn't tell us what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Now, I know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">After the war, he told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  What happened to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  What happened to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="624">He was beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and then he run away from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I have the details how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I'll give you a copy of his write up, and he writes how he escaped, but I don't recall offhand. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The police in the beginning supported the underground, and that's one reason why the old police, big shots, police chiefs and so on were killed by Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Then I believe a second time, something similar happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">At the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , I believe the Chief of Police was also killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They were supporting and this Consul of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> had knowledge of this activity, and they were supporting it, but this was never revealed to Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Now, we know what happened, but during the war the Germans didn't know the Consul was supporting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  When you say that the police and the Consul were supporting the underground, in what ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  I mean, the first objective of the underground was to get weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And police were instrumental in controlling the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">There were Germans controlling the <span class="DLF">gate</span> on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the second <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the Jewish police were controlling, and Germans were lazy and so they didn't search people. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Jewish police searched people. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And they used to let in arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">That's how the underground built up quite a bit of their different arms, their rifles and guns and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , five years ago, when my brother was still there, to convince him to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So they took me in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> used to be, which there is very little left, but there 1s one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and under this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was built underground a complete <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , and this was a <span class="DLF">shooting gallery</span> to teach Jewish partisans how to use guns and how to shoot the target. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And this underground was dug out by the underground, and it was used for this purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Nobody would hear their shooting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Who did the teaching? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Who taught them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  There were -- I mean between the Jewish populations there were people who were in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">As I told you, I was in the Army, I was a lieutenant , so I was not, but there were other people who were officers in the Lithuanian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">There were some -- I mean there was some movement, at that time already, before Russians came in in 1940, there were some movement to teach Jewish people to be a military people, because they already were thinking then about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">There was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where Jewish families could send youngsters to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to teach them how to be a Marine and how to fight at war, and they were preparing for it at that time, the beginning the Jewish Army, the liberation Army in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Then everything stopped there. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The communists came and the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Then there were a group of Jewish people who had a very good knowledge about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea how the Consul was helping the underground?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  I don't have the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I don't want to guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Do you think in general there was sort of a strong spirit of defiance or resistance 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , or was there something special about this spiritual resistance maybe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  No, I don't think there existed spiritual resistance or resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">To Germans or Lithuanians there exists only one thing: self preservation. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Every person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> had a feeling that resistance is a useless type of thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">They felt that resistance would not solve the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Even this underground, the way I understand, made contacts with Lithuanian underground in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because there was a certain number of Lithuanian underground who didn't like German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And they didn't accept these people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> because they are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They would say it's not what we're looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We're looking to make Lithuanian independent, you'll not help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And very few groups accepted Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Then when this rumor started around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> that Lithuanian underground does not accept Jews, then Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> probably felt that this is not the solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Solution is self preservation until the end of the war, and we were hoping for the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  Were you aware or were you ever told about people trying to escape into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or any of the underground activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Underground activities, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Nobody talked about underground activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Escape, people escaped, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They say what happened to this fellow? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">He escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Underground activity, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">People didn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They knew that it exists, but they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The thing is it's a very secretive type movement, and they knew that certain people were killed because they talked about the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">It was very secretive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Were there regular actions or arrests in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Action as in organized killing? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Yes, sure there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">There were three major ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">One is liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">When we moved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> there were two. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">There was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Big Ghetto</span> and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> , which had a population of 7,000, if I'm correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was established, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> was liquidated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  Do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">The majority of people who knew there was some <span class="DLF">pedestrian bridge</span> going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Big Ghetto</span> because in between was a <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Then who got the message, said the Germans are thinking to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> , escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Big Ghetto</span> , but that left quite a sizable population. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So one day they came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , mostly Lithuanians, and called the people who were left there, and took them to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It was the first time they used the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> to kill Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And they were all killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Did you know at the time where they were taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  The date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  No, did you know at that time, where they were being taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">After a few weeks or so, we found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  How did you find out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  First there was certain communication between Lithuanians and people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , because people used to work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and everybody knew somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , or if they didn't know somebody, they would say would you like to buy a loaf of bread from me, and used to tell stories, what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So, this 1s how you find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Then, I don't know, from this act here, people escaped, but from other actions, people escaped, a few people escaped and come back together and tell what's happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Was this liquidation the same time that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was ruined, which was I think the beginning of October '41?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  The liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Small Ghetto</span> was later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  I'm trying to remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was beginning of October.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  How did they do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Did they burn, did they shoot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  They just stated on the loudspeaker that everybody should stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Nobody should walk out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Then they came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with rifles and say out, out, out, to go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and, then these people, the Germans had people with dogs go through the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to make sure there were no human beings left. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And he go from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and collect all people. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Then this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">This was done exactly or in a similar manner, with loudspeakers and notice was posted all over that on Tuesday morning everybody should stay in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Nobody should go out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Then announcement came that everybody should go to a certain big <span class="DLF">field</span> , like a <span class="REGION">farm land</span> , and there was Lithuanians and Germans who lined everybody up, six in a row or five in a row, like an Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">At the same time, Lithuanians were came in, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they are going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to make sure that everybody was out and whoever was left didn't walk out, they were to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And then after everybody was lined up, I forgot to say, one German SS man who was in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , or who was one of the ones in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , went through the <span class="DLF">line</span> , which there were five people in one row and divided two people here and three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Actually he broke up whole families. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And where was this two people row, he would force them to go on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And whoever was left in the other group, could go back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  Now, were you part of this action?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  Who did they put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">What kind of people did they put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> versus the people they said could go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  It was unrelated. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">They lined up everybody five in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Then broke up these rows, two on the left hand side and three on the right hand side, and then they took this rows of threes, or rows of twos, I don't remember, and say these people will go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and these people can go back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It was unrelated to who you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  But they didn't say we want the strong people here and the women and children there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  No, not during this action.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were thinking at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  At the time I think this is the end of me, because I was lined up in the row was me, my mother, my brother and my brother's wife and my brother's wife's brother makes five.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family when this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Who were you with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  I was with my mother, my brother, my brother's wife and my brother's wife's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">There were five in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">We were divided two on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and three on the second <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">The family was broken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">At that time, some miracle happened and thanks to my brother, who is now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he started to scream and push people in front of him and two Lithuanians came in and said what's going here, go here, go here, go here, go here and one Lithuanian general, who was in charge, started to scream, <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , what are you doing to these two Lithuanians -- <span class="NPIP">hell</span> what are you doing here, go where to here to this row of people, and they walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And then all of us moved into the <span class="NPIP">good side</span> very fast, and that's how it stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And there were five on the so called good <span class="NPIP">side</span> and others were taken away on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So, it's just a miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">QUESTION:  Do you remember other mass arrests or actions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">There was the second action in, I believe, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Not until then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  No, until then I think it was just minor events. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Major, people were killed, but there was one event which I missed which was as soon as was closed and everyone was living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , was issued certain directives that all Jews should turn in all gold and valuables, and whoever did not turn in would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">There was collection points and everybody brought in their silver, gold or valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And what many people decided to hide it, quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">At that time, quite a few were killed because they found they were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">But they couldn't find all because certain people were smart enough to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Especially at the time a popular thing was gold coins which Jewish people always collect after first World War, gold coins because they thought it was the safest thing to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So there were quite a number of gold coins Jewish people had and it was very easy to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Thanks to the gold coins, food, you could obtain food during <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> time and get better accommodation for some good means to sustain yourself with gold coins. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">At that time, this was a very tragic time, because then Germans came they brought dogs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and they were going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to look to see if you turned in all gold, and if you don't hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And they even took some people to undress them completely, some women to undress and the dogs were trained go and lick their sexual organs to make sure there is no coins of gold hidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  Excuse me, what was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  They had dogs trained, they used to take certain woman, tell them to undress completely, and the dog with its tongue would lick their sexual organ of the woman to find if they put any gold coins there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  Do you know people that this happened to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Yes I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">This was in the beginning, and it shook up all the Ghetto population, but this was a very tragic event.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  Now, throughout this time you were working, your wife was working, what was your mother doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Was she working also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  No, she was ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">She was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">She could barely walk at the time, and she was bedridden. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">She could cook, get out of her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and cook, but mostly she was bedridden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  But they allowed that, or they didn't know about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">ANSWER:  No, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">At that time, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , nobody checked to see if somebody was ill or not ill or children because as long as you provided quite a number of workers, this labor department provided would say we need for tomorrow twelve hundred, fifteen hundred workers for this brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">As long as could produce fifteen hundred workers, they didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They didn't go searching <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , unless somebody told them there must be guns or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">There was this second action was in March, I believe, in 1943 and this action was to eliminate all sick, elderly people and children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">QUESTION:  I think this may have been '44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER:  If you could look in the file, it's written there. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Yes, this was the action in '44 where they eliminated all children, sick people and elderly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">This took place during the day and nobody anticipated that this was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Everybody was out working in the <span class="BUILDING">brigades</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And they were going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and anybody left who didn't go to work or was sick or bedridden or old or a child they took in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> and took to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They took my mother then during that. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">When I came back from work, I found she was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Now, for reasons which I don't recall, I went to work but my brother stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and also my wife stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the time, and they made my wife and my brother to carry out my mother to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I have certain -- not a poem but a story written by my brother, which 1s a very nice story of how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">How they did this? </span><span class="sentence" id="817">She was taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and was killed at the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  When you came back from work, what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was completely messed up, and my wife was there and my brother were there and they told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  Did this happen in all <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It's a certain type of word to word communication which exists in our society, but then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">It was fairly good organized and once it happened in the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , then everybody knew it was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And everybody started to hide people, children to hide and elderly people to hide, and to the best of my recollection my wife and my brother tried to hide my mother someplace in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , but anyway they found her and she was taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and taken to <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">End of Tape #4 Tape #5
ANSWER:  Yes, several people were taken the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> , to get out, and after they finished their work the majority of them were killed, and they're killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They never came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , except a certain group of people that escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I'm not certain how many, but I know two people who escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">One is , who was a good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">His wife is a good friend of my wife, and she is alive, but he passed away just recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">He had cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And he was telling me all the details and stories of how he escaped, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And then there is another person, I don't recall his name, who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">nylon factory</span> , for stockings, became very wealthy, and he escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  What did he tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">ANSWER:  Just that they told me exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">They were digging out, opening the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and burning it and crushing the bones left over with certain tools, whatever they had, and it was terrible conditions to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">It was a terrible smell, and then at the end they knew it, they saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">They were killing the workers who worked, who were doing this work. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And somehow by miracles, they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">One person told me, I believe, that he was laying under, made believe that he was shot, and when night came he escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">That one person I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">This was probably in '43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  One more question about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">At a certain point, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was turned into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">QUESTION:  What's the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="846">How did that change things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  Probably it was changed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> based on the German classification. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">It was easier -- I cannot answer the question, because, as far as I recall, there was no change in the behavior of the guards or Germans or Lithuanians who guarded together. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Everybody had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I just assumed it was easier to kill a Jew or to beat them up or do things like provide less food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">But I know at one time they changed it, the classification.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  It didn't change your life?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  I believe I covered everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  Any special or difficult memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  I can tell you an item of general interest about the Jewish society in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">When I got, when we decided to get married in '43, and we invited our immediate family for a wedding dinner, and at that time we decided to make a cholen (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Do you know what a cholen is? </span><span class="sentence" id="863">A cholen is a traditional Jewish meal which you put in potatoes and beans and meat in a pot and it stays for 24 hours, it cooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">In Orthodox of the Jewish family, you don't cook on Saturday, on Shabbos (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="865">You get the meal at the end of Shabbos. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">You do it Friday early. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">This was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Potatoes were available and beans were available and then somehow we organized a small turkey, which we put in this pot and took it to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> to stay in the over, where they bake bread for 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">When they came back to take it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the people came for this festive dinner, the turkey was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Actually, there was stealing between Jews, from Jews to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Everybody was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Everybody wanted to get something special other than only potatoes and beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">The turkey was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I mean this was just a small event. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It wasn't important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  Were there deportations from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  Didn't come back who was killed during work? </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Yes, there was, like I mentioned, at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , quite a few people were killed during work, or died from overwork or were killed because they wanted to escape or do something, buy a loaf of bread from a Lithuanian peasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  Did the Germans come in and take Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="883">No, I don't recall it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  Did you at this point have much information about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  You were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> until the liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="888">What was the liquidation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  The liquidation came from directives that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> be liquidated and all people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> should report to a certain <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">There, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , they would be taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Those assigned by District, that first this District, then this section comes, this section, this day and this hour and this was a directive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  This was in '44, March or April -- August '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">The majority of people, especially the younger people, knew what was happening, and they already had certain feeling that this would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">They were building some <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">There was certain involved activity in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> during last six months before, maybe eight months before, to organize and build a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> where you would hide in case -- we had enough knowledge that war was coming to the end, somehow in case they would decide to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , everybody would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So, we had the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , one of the major <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was this two <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and under the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> they dug out a long <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , and there they made like a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , like a <span class="BUILDING">nuclear shelter</span> , to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">We thought we would go there, but when we came there, it was just full. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">They wouldn't let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Because you know it had a capacity of people for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , on so many people can go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So, we turned around, and we built our own shelter, because I had two days time approximately, which the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , there was a big <span class="DLF">field</span> , like <span class="REGION">farm land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">We dug a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> about five feet deep or whatever it is, and removed from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a few <span class="DLF">doors</span> , put across and put on top some shrubbery, and there we put some water and a loaf of bread, and we went into this <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , me and my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And we were sitting there and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was already, the last transports had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and then the Germans were walking around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> to find if there were any people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And they came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were, and we heard the one German tell, there's nobody here. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And they were leaving already and we thought fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">So, only one German walked over our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and stepped on the two <span class="DLF">doors</span> where we had space for air to come in and stepped in with his foot, went in, and he started to scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">He got scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">He said there are Jews underground and everybody came running and surrounded us with rifles, and said out, out whoever is there and we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And then -- it was terrible in there, we had perspired and there was dirt coming down on us and -- then he put us against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">The German soldier put his rifle to shoot us, and one German officer came over and said, we are taking you to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which 1s a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">People are usually clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">You are still young, and I don't think we should kill you, but we will take you to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where you will be useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , rush around, change your clothes, which we did, and took us to the special last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">After they took us from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they came back and blew up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , dynamite and who ever was left, hidden in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> underground or any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> was killed, dynamiting the <span class="REGION">area</span> , including all my relatives, my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">We were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">We were hiding them, and they were killed during the dynamiting of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So, we came to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and each left and went to -- we knew where we were going because it was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I don't know how many people were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but we could barely sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I'm not sure if there was food or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">It was very limited, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Let we came to first stop which they ordered out all of the woman, left , and this is where my wife left and went to . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And next stop in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They brought us to <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I mean there was no sanitary facilities in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> so everybody did wherever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">There was limited food. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">People were getting crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Some people who I know, a woman, a young woman got just crazy, was screaming all of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">It was not a pleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">It was probably the worst experience I had being in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Then we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and we didn't know what's happening there because they lined us up again like a brigade, four in a row, whatever, and then around us are people who used to be call Kopa (ph) which we didn't know who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">It was a certain uniforms had, but this was Jewish people, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Some were homosexual, Germans, the Nazis took homosexuals and put them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They were beating us up, line up, line up, stay here, stay here and then took us to some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and we went to sleep probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We stayed there maybe a week, and then they transferred us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp Slanseberg</span> (ph).</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  What did you do for this week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="946">What was it like?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  You were telling me about you week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , what your days were like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Probably, based on my memory, they fed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They gave better food than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , because probably after the transport in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we were really in a bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Probably they wanted to bring us up to better certain standards which they have in order to make most use for us as laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">But, they already call the morning crews to line up on a certain <span class="NPIP">place outside</span> , and they count us and assign us numbers, as I told. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">After a week approximately, they moved us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> which was satellite, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="956"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> was still a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> opened at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">There was no <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They brought masonite and made like <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> of masonite where we slept on straw, put straw on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and slept there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">QUESTION:  Who were you with at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Were you with a brother?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  In the <span class="DLF">trench</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  No, the <span class="DLF">trench</span> is to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">The <span class="DLF">trench</span> , you used to walk and on both sides used to be a five foot space, and you used to lay down and sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  No <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  No, no <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And after we finished the construction of this so-called <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , then they started to take us out to <span class="BUILDING">working brigades</span> and work was a underground factory for for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">They felt that the war come to an end soon and decided to build an underground factory, and this was someplace in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> which was where we were digging, and there was very stony ground and wheelbarrows and carrying stones and digging ditches, mixing cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">It was a very difficult type of work, manual work. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Many people got sick, of course not enough food, were killed or died working there, and population of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was decreasing very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">One morning when everybody lined up on the <span class="DLF">field</span> and takes a count they asked if there was anybody that knows something about architect, or who knows anything about building <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and I was standing next to two fairly prominent architects in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and they wouldn't pick up their hands and I said why. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">They said they want to find out who is educated and kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I didn't believe them, so I picked up my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Then they called me and said what we are getting here many Germans SS men coming here with the families as guard to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there is no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> for them so we want to open a small <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to build <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> for these Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Could you organize and find who is cabinet maker between people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Get about eight or ten people, and we will get you some equipment and some wood and build <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So, 1t sounded good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So, we started to do it, and we were still exposed to the same food which was given us, which was just a little soup in the morning, just a liquid, just nothing <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and the same thing in the evening and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">But then the Germans started to come in, and one German told us he wanted this <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , this, this and then another German comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">One is like a captain or a higher rank, and I was told to do first for a higher rank officer than for lieutenants of a smaller rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Then the smaller rank would come in, and I'd say we have so many orders for these people to do and we cannot, it would take months and months. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">So, the next day he comes with a piece of sausage or a piece of bread and says can you advance it some how. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So, that's how I got to organize more food than the average person had, and I shared with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">At that time, my wife's father passed away already from conditions which were not enough food and hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And also, I believe my brother-in-law passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  How old were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">ANSWER:  Probably late forties I would assume. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Probably, I'm not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">QUESTION:  The conditions were that bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  Yes, 1t was a very bad condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Then this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg camp</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and Dr. Elkous was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> together, and he was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">He came over to German authority in this camp and told him, look in order to take care of all the sick people, I need this and this and this medication and this equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">The Germans looked at this and said, okay we'll take care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">But by weeks and weeks nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So then Dr. Elkous went over to them and said I need bed linen because there are more and more sick people here and if I don't get by this day, I will go on a hunger strike, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He died of being on a hunger strike for, I believe, ten days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">QUESTION:  Did you know him personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">ANSWER:  Yes, I knew him because my father and him went to the same <span class="BUILDING">Jewish School</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hader</span> , in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And then when he became a doctor in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , he was our doctor.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  I don't mean to back track, but since we're talking -- just because you did know him and he was your doctor, did that give you any special privileges in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  Limited amount like I mentioned I was taking care of this public works in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">It's because I knew him or I knew his sisters which was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Then when I finished this and I started to work at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and then I became in charge of certain brigade where I met my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">The reason I became in charge of brigade because of certain connection there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And then certain major events took place after I got married -- or before I got married, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Germans selected about 20 or 30, I don't know how many, young woman to take them to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> to dig out vegetables that were ripe to pick up vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And everybody was convinced that once they finished this work, they would be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Then I went to Dr. Elkous and this Goldberg who was his assistant and told him, I want to get my wife back, what can you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I mean, please do something about it, and they did something about it, because she came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">End of Tape #5 Tape #6
