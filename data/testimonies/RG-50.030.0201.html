</span><span class="sentence" id="58">And when they started really giving a very hard time to all the Jews and beating and and resettling, the people started moving in. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My aunt bought me a ticket on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and said go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So I was on the <span

know. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And he took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there were maybe twenty other Jews, so he kept us over there like some of them he kept like a week, two, two days, five days and slowly he and his wife took them through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and tried to help them go on, get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He kept me six weeks I was over there, and one day he said it's time to move on, and he took me through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and I walked like miles and miles...[ don't even know what direction, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Some people gave me a ride, you know, and I told them where I want to go and finally I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I[came over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">There were no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I knew I had an aunt, my mother's sister, in . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So I walked

anybody 1s, was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He put me in a

came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and she smuggled me through <span class="DLF">fields</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rawa Russkaya</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  It...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was really a transient place where people came, stayed a while, worked, and from there tried to leave to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> like you have in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> which you work and you establish a life and you're...it was really a place where people, Jewish people could come, be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> , but it did not have the the facilities to accommodate people who came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Jewish people, because where would they go. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So I I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> for a while, and then somebody came to me by the name of Andre _ (ph), and said, you know, you better come and join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And I joined the Brichah (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to be trained, you know...tell me what to...what I'm going to have to do and things like that, and my main job was to try to find children and bring them to , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And from there, we put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> into and tried to smuggle them in through the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Tell us about uh some of the children and some of the things that you did in the Brichah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Most of the children that we gathered were orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They were children who Jewish families left either with neighbors or some other Poles or people who wanted to make some extra money from the Jewish families, kept the child through the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You know, once the war is over and they can dispose of the child or send it back or and get lots of money paid for it, if they can track, you know...lots of Polish people came to us with these children and demanded a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Others wouldn't give up with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Some adopted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The others had free labor and most of the children didn't really know that they're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We had to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There were different ways to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We used to come to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and, you know, pretend that they are Poles, and go to the <span class="BUILDING">inns</span> and sit and drink and eat with the Poles and joke around about the Jews and here and there you could hear a rumor from...somebody say...hey, you know these five kids of these and this and this family were all blond but there is a black one over there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I bet you she's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Or I'd bet you he's Jewish, so we kind of found out this way how the kids are, where they are, what they're doing, and tried to gather them in order to send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  How did you get them...how did you go about getting them?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Physically get them out of the families first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Well, most of the times we came and negotiated. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We paid money. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We gave jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Sometimes even you had to just grab them, just kidnap them. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I hate to use that word, because it's really not kidnapping, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It's getting back what was yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Now let's pause.
