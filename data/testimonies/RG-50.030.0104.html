He's dressed like a soldier, but in the reality he is a mass murderer. "</span><span class="sentence" id="772">Why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And uh,...and so I got the permission to have the prayers done. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I was uh, basically all my life an atheist. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Hardly, you know, not interested in these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But when I was attending these prayers where fathers were without children, children were without fathers, husbands were without wives, wives were without...without children--all torn families... And it was at that time three hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And uh,... Or maybe it was already when we got from...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , fit may have been (ph)] possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But it is...it is...
