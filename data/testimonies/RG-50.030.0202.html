<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Pierre Sauvage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born on March 25, 1944, near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Uh, would you tell me about your parents and how they came to be uh near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, my parents, uh...
QUESTION:  Their names first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My parents, Leo Sauvage and uh Barbara Sauvage--whose maiden name is [Sucholosky (ph)|--were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother being a Polish Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> ; my father being a French Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lorraine</span> in <span class="REGION">eastern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And uh they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> at the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> --it's [in the] south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> --and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the fall of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My mother being pregnant at the time with me, and uh that is where I had the good fortune to be born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Uh what were the circumstances, do you know, of their getting to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">How did they reach it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Uh in their case they uh heard about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> from a friend, who suggested it to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My father had a particularly uh hard task, because not only did he have to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would be safe--my mother being particularly vulnerable as a foreign Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And, of course, the French were focusing uh much of their collaborative efforts in terms of turning over Jews on the foreign Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So my mother was particularly vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Uh, but in addition she had a problem pregnancy; and apparently the only chance she had of bringing the baby safely into the world was if she had as much peace and quiet and food as possible, which is a bit of a tall order for Nazi-occupied Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh, and this friend uh suggested Le Chambon. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He...he knew the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; and my father went there and found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to rent, and uh went back to uh get my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And they came on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam engine train</span> that uh brought many Jews there, as we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And uh...uh it was uh singularly fortunate, because I'll uh...I'll also mention that uh the doctor who took care of my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> was exactly for me the right doctor in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Not only did he happen to be a whiz of a doctor who had trained under Albert Schweitzer in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , dealing with all sorts of problems and apparently had a reputation as a bit of a medical genius, but in addition he was a a committed Christian--one of the first uh of the <span class="REGION">area</span> to be committed to non-violent resis...resistance against the Nazis--and had a special stake in my mother's situation and this baby that she wanted to bring into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I don't think that uh she would have gotten better medical attention if I had been born in the most modern <span class="BUILDING">American facility</span> today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  So you were, or your mother was, brought to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Where...where...the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that your parents rented, uh from whom did they rent it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  They rented it from a peasant couple in a uh little hamlet which is a part of <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Fayolle</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="26">| Uh, I was known as the baby that used to wake up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Uh, they uh...uh, well as I mentioned in my film, "Weapons of the Spirit," I...I...my parents didn't remain in touch, actually, with the farmers who rented that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But I tracked them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And the widow of the farmer who did rent the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is in my film. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh...
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Where...where did your parents go after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  They went to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> for a year--which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> --where my father was a journalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My father was already a journalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He had been a journalist before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Let's stay a minute [in] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> for that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh, they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  They were there from the fall of 1943 'til the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I don't know exactly when they leave, come to think of it... when they left, come to think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But it...I think it was around uh August of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  You talk, obviously, a lot about this in your film. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh, but for the purposes of this interview, would you tell me more about the people with whom your parents came in contact, as they told it to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You were, of course, an infant. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And did they know your parents were Jewish, and what that meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  (Pause) I've got to go about it... It's complicated, because there...there are presuppositions in the question that I have to actually address. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That's the uh... I was not raised with stories about Le Chambon. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh, I was uh not raised with stories about the war, with stories about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I was raised by parents who wanted to put all that behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, much of what I've come to know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> --although I've since spoken quite a bit about my parents, and I've gotten certainly information that is relevant. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh, but it's not uh...a lot of my information 1s really information that I got as an adult, uh talking to people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then we'll do this, as it were, at the end of the interview rather than at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And let's talk about uh... And we'll talk about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> , as such, at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh tell me where your parents went. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , you said. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Uh, what did they do there and for how long were they there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Well, they were there 'til uh after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were 'til 1948, when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Uh, my father, among other things, edited a uh intellectual weekly called "[La Rue (ph)|," which was uh quite prominent, had very prestigious uh writers--uh, including uh Sartre, Camus, and Raymond [Quenot (ph)]--and people like that contributed articles to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But uh it was a very difficult time to launch a...a publication and there were all sorts of restrictions, including paper restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And uh ultimately it had to fold after about ten or twelve issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And uh my father uh had to find work; and ultimately he decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where he shortly thereafter became the correspondent of Le Figaro--a French daily--which he was for twenty-five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Uh, [he was] also writing a number of books and also uh contributing to a number of other publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , uh by the time you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or were about to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , you would be four years--or close to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Oh, I think I have a few uh memories that must go back to that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But I'm really stunned by how much difficulty I have remembering much of my childhood; and I think that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised with memory being uh bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Uh, I was discouraged from...from remembering. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I was discouraged from asking questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I think that's tampered with my ability to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And maybe that's what's given me a...a compelling need to...to document precisely, because I don't trust memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Or maybe even to tell stories such as I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, so I remember uh startling little. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">In fact, the most startling thing I...I've thought about sometimes is that uh--particularly I have a two and a half year old daughter now--and...and is that I realize I was four when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I cannot until then... Obviously, I did not speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I cannot remember ever...I cannot remember the experience of having been in a <span class="REGION">foreign land</span> and not speaking the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I have absolutely no recollection of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And that, to me--and...and I can't imagine that that wasn't a traumatic experience, and I cannot connect with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I cannot remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I realize that four is already not, you know, it's not a baby anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So uh I...1 do view myself as a...as a product of a uh...of a traumatized childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Well, let's talk about that, and talk more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh, when you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , uh what do you remember about those yearly, early years and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Opposed to what you were told?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Very little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Very little, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh, as I get older I remember more, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But uh I...uh I think that the fact that uh my parents withheld from me vital information as to my identity-- as to who they were, as to why we were there, as to uh why they were who they were--uh really uh confused all my...all normal relationships with the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Who did you believe your parents were? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">How did... They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">You were with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You had no memory of before. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Did you believe you were Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I knew that uh... No. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In fact, I was raised very French. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Uh, the uh...I...I now believe that part of the reason I was raised so French was that it was a way of obliterating the Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Uh, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">French school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We spoke French at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; although I shouldn't overstate that, because there was also my...my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Even though she was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had a great love of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">By the way, she spoke French uh impeccably; and that had something to do with her survival during the war, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She was able successfully to impersonate a Frenchwoman. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I have uh come from a family with great linguistic skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Uh, my sister later became an actress in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , uh playing Mexicans on the screen, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And as anyone who knows about acting knows, there's nothing more difficult than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So it's...it's like, it's funny how you see these things follow through. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Uh no, but we...I didn't...I knew we weren't Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I knew that we were...we were uh... In fact, interestingly, uh although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I was Jewish, we...I always knew we were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We were foreign. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It's almost a way in which my parents prepared me to...to then absorb the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">If they had been people who completely assimilated, I certainly would have been a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh, just by remaining French, by remaining different, by not even being immigrants...my parents, I...they never really identified them[selves] as immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I always had the feeling in the back of my mind that one day we would go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My father was a correspondent. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You know, that this was not necessarily, you know, the...the final move. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I never viewed them as like part of the, you know, immigrant flow into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh, very strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  What about religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Uh, no religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Uh I remember we...uh I was what might be called a "nothing." </span><span class="sentence" id="125">In other words, when I'd ask my parents, "What...what are we?," </span><span class="sentence" id="126">they'd say, "We're nothing." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then they would move on; try to, you know, dismiss...dismiss the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Uh, not long ago my sister mentioned, by the way, that she was not the only "nothing" in her class. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Uh, you know, there...there are people who...who find themselves in... in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh, but no. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We were not...we were not Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I never assumed that, although it was confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I guess I assumed that uh... (Pause) I guess I must have assumed that we were uh, you know, originally Christian; but my father was violently anti-religious, as was my mother, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And uh that meant nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I mean, there was nothing Christian about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh we were nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  How did it feel to be a nothing, to be of no religion and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Well, at the time uh I thought that was fine; or I...I thought ...I thought that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh, I've come to feel very differently about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But that's uh...[ uh, you know, people often uh ask me--since I've mentioned the fact that I only learned I was Jewish when I was eighteen-- uh, "How did it...?" </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And what happened is that my parents sat me down and told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I was about to go off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to study, and uh was going to be staying with a cousin of mine, uh who happens to be a survivor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">To compound the irony, a rather prominent gentlemen at that, Samuel [Pisar (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And uh people will sometimes say, "Well, was it a real shock?" </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You know, "How did you react?" </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I...they're surprised that it --I don't even remember exactly how I reacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And basically the information never really got through to me, but the facts got through to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But when you are raised with taboos, the taboos are so internalized that you don't fully absorb the information even when it is given to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You...your...your filtering mechanisms keep working. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Not only was I in the course of...of maintaining this...this lie about who we were, part of what that entailed is that I was completely cut off from almost all of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Uh, it was a great...except for a few members who joined in this conspiracy of not, of keeping the secret from the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Uh, but uh it's still stunning to me to realize that my mother had aunts and uncles in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> whom I never knew, because they couldn't be counted on to maintain the secret of our being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And now as I reconnect with those family members, I still...there's a part of me that finds it very difficult to absorb their identities and their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It's like I...I'm...I still feel this 1s information I'm not supposed to have, and I have to fight to to have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  When did you start... Let's keep going with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">When... when you went uh to your...your relative uh Samuel [Pisar (ph)], what was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Did the information become a little more internalized for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  No, it really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It took a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And uh I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ten years, and I had no interest in...in any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Uh...uh Sam at the time was uh uh...(pause) like many survivors, uh concerned with building his life; and he's an ambitious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And focusing on...on that, uh although he would he would tell me stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I think the...the main effect of that was he...he...he... Although he doesn't really remember it, uh he...he did tell me stories about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and about his experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And uh they had a profound effect on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Uh but I still didn't really...1 couldn't even...I'm not sure I could define what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I...I still... No, I didn't uh...uh I had no Jewish identity when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Uh, and no Jewish involvements. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And uh...uh I...that really only started... The key influence in my life, in that respect, was my wife--whom I married uh not long after I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> in 1971-- who's a uh Los Angeles native, uh uh very Jewish if one can speak in those terms, and very comfortable being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And uh who worked on me for years and years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And uh...and then the most decisive influence of all was ultimately having children and realizing that I wanted them to have a very secure and comfortable sense of identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And uh we uh...my wife wanted to send our son to a <span class="BUILDING">Reform day school</span> , which is where he goes now and where he thrives. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And uh that has had an influence on me as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  As you began to discover your own identity and who you were, did you discuss this with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Yes, we...we had uh a number of discussions uh over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Uh, this was a very difficult subject for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My father died in uh October of 1988, not long before my film on Le Chambon--"Weapons of the Spirit"--was released. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Although he did see it uh before he died, and the whole process that I was involved in was a very difficult one for him and a very scary one for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Uh, after all, he had built his whole public persona on not being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And uh...and as a journalist this was, you know, sort of a compounded irony. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Not only was he a journalist, he was a good journalist; and he was also a crusader for truth and had been all his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Uh, with this one big lie in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And here he had bred, as these things sometimes happen; this increasingly public Jew - not only a Jew, but somebody who was even insistent on being quite public about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And uh I'll never forget one day uh in the early '80's, uh and I had this French film director who was visiting in L[os] A[ngeles] and we had dinner or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I talked about myself, and just coincidentally he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> shortly thereafter and he met my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And uh in a phone conversation the following Sunday, my father said, "Why did you say that I..."--that my father--"was Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I thought, "What...what was he talking about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I said, "I...I didn't talk about...I don't even remember talking about you." </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And then he said, "Well, I met this director. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And he mentioned..." And then I realized I had talked about myself; but talking about myself exposed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I'll never forget that conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">This was my...my dilemma, and it was in fact my dilemma in making the film - to preserve their privacy, their right to have some control over how they led their lives, which I basically believe was my obligation. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">At the same time, not to allow that to cripple my own ability to lead my own life and uh pass a healthy heritage on to my children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  It was quite a balancing act.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was it was a very difficult balancing act. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Now the film itself was very much uh... Interestingly, the film was very much negotiated with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They asked me to take out certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Which I did; including things that I thought it was wrong to take out. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Uh, I'll mention one. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Uh (pause) I'll start again on that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Uh the film was...the film was
QUESTION:  Let's hold it one second, if we could... (Technical Conversation) OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Let's pick up with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  The film was uh negotiated with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They uh, for instance, asked me to take out certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">My mother...1n particular, my mother asked me to take out very specific things. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I remember she asked me to take out three things. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And I thought about it; and I ended up...ended up taking out all three. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And they hurt on various levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I'll mention one, because it was interesting the sort of dilemma I was facing. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh in the film, I initially...I...I referred to my mother losing much of her family, and I show a photograph of my mother surrounded by her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And originally I had named all the dead relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And my mother asked me to take out the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I really thought that was, I mean, the greatest honor I could do to these people was to name them, to give them that identity--my grandmother, Feige Sucholosky. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But I just decided, in that instance, that uh my respect for my mother would take precedence. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I took out the names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Since this is not a commercial film but will be a scholarly film, would you like to tell us the names of your mother's relatives who died, to preserve their memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Well, the...the...the...the...the key ones that uh that I allude to are my grandmother, Feige Sucholosky, my uh... (Pause) You know, it's...it's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I really don't normally freeze in any sort of interview situation, and I've done it a number of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I realize it's absolutely no coincidence that even though I have gone over those names so often, that there's a part of me that like shuts off because I'm...I'm not supposed to...to do it in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Uh but yes, my...my uncle, Memel (ph) Sucholosky; my mother's sister... How can I, how can I not, how can I freeze on her...on her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  It's OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  It's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You have been trained since childhood not to remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Amazing how effective uh those things are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Let's go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Uh huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  We can come back to this later. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Uh, can you tell me... You've talked a good bit about the relations with your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I have one more question about your parents, and then we'll leave that phase. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Have you managed through all this to remain close to your parents, or has it separated you in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  There were tense moments with my father, as I was developing into a person different from what he had anticipated. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Uh my father ended up liking the film quite a bit, which is really in a...1n a way the strongest endorsement of the film I ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Because with his mind-set, uh for him to say that the film was, you know, basically correct, I thought, "My God, it really must be pretty...pretty correct." </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Uh, he used to argue, though, that uh the film--and he's the only person who's ever said this to me, which is sort of funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But he always argued that the film would have been better if I had left myself completely out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Uh, but uh hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We ...we never broke relations ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We would have regular Sunday conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Uh, I don't... Let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I hope that I will have a closer relationship with my own children than I had with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I think that uh people are punished for their sins. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I think the way they raised me was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I think it impaired our ability to bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Let's go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I think that should sit a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And go back to a young man growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Uh, along the way--uh, again, for the record--I'd like to know a little bit more about the kind of schooling you had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and what you did as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">What was your family life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Let's start with <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It's easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  I'll tell you, the most striking thing about...about my childhood friends is that I realized a few years ago that of my closest friends when I was a young child, uh a high percentage uh were if not children of Holocaust survivors-- although there were...there were...there were some... In fact, my closest friend for a number of years was. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Uh, at least uh related [to the Holocaust] in the sense that some of them, their parents had come like in the '30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And often those people don't identify as survivors, because they came earlier, even though they still lost a lot of their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And often the effects are not efficiently...uh, sufficiently acknowledged as still being Holocaust-related effects. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Certainly, in terms of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Children almost never identify as children of Holocaust survivors, if their parents came in the mid-'30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Although often they have a lot more in common with children of survivors than they realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And this ...this is all the more striking since I didn't...not only did I not know I was the parents...the child...the child of Holocaust survivors, I didn't even know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So it's funny that it was with these people that the relationships uh developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But I...I think that's just a measure of the inescapable commonalities that...that were there even though the labels, you know, weren't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It wasn't relationships based on labels. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It was relationships based on, uh I guess, similar attitudes or similar things in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Uh, I identify very strongly with uh second generation children of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I have been intermittently active in such groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Uh I think uh I have learned a lot from uh other children of survivors, even though my parents’ case was different in many respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And, of course, I use "survivor"--"Holocaust survivor"--in the broadest sense, which encompasses people who weren't in... My parents were never in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But they were in hiding, they were in fear, they lost family. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I find that they...the result of those...those times have uh set in motion a certain number of things that uh we children of survivors have in common.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Such as...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Uh, well, some strengths, some weaknesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And uh I think uh what I am most insistent on-in fact, I've been quite incendiary about it at times--is that uh we need to find our own way towards those memories, our own paths, uh fully respectful of the experience of our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Uh, needing to learn from it, needing to hear them, needing to hear that testimony as much as everybo...everybody needs to hear that testimony; but at the same time, not to be...feel dwarfed by it, to acknowledge our own childhood hurts, to realize that in some respects uh we have been victims of the Holocaust in our own right, victims of the effect of the Holocaust through our parents, and uh sometimes our parents have not been able to acknowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">This was too painful to them, that such hurts occurred; and that often they-- unwillingly, unwittingly, simply because they went through the experience that they went through--were the cause of some of this...this pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Children of survivors need to acknowledge that pain, need to acknowledge that need to...to form their own identities. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Uh and that does involve, if they're interested in psychology, I I believe nothing is more important than to be able to get in touch with your...your childhood pains and acknowledge its existence and identify it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And that is the only way it will not be passed on to your own children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  In doing that, in attempting to reach yourself, as it were, you have, among other things, chosen to become a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">How did you actually... You talked about your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But how...how does...how did that process develop, and how has that interact[ed] with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  The question of my Jewish identity is such an...my Jewish identity 1s such an evolving one that it really changes; not only from year to year, but probably from month to month. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I have no idea what exactly that identity will be uh five years from now. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Whether it will be a very pronounced one, or whether I will decide enough of this and this really doesn't matter to me that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I... really don't...I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I know that uh I felt a need to have an identity, that the only identity that it made sense for me to have was the identity of my ancestors. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh, and that I have indeed become increasingly comfortable with it, that I realize that a lot of who I am is indeed uh wrapped up in...in Judaism and uh its influences on my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You know, the influence...the influences exist whether they're identified or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The fact that my parents uh never acknowledged being Jewish doesn't mean they weren't, in very fundamental ways, very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Uh, and uh and that influence was probably there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Uh, but uh... (Pause) You know, it's interesting how these things work. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I think the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> made me more Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They... First of all, I came to believe that at bottom, when you've cut through all the specifics of why they did what they did or all the conjecture--one can do all the factors that come into this--uh at bottom everything flowed from their own inescapable sense of their own identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Their own sense of comfort at being who they were, at having no questions about who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And everything flowed, almost inescapably, incredibly naturally and very spontaneously, from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">That sense of identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And if one derived strength from that, that rootedness, uh well then I had to try to aspire-- particularly as a parent, and wanting to be able to raise strong children--had to aspire to a similar rootedness and had to find my roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And my roots were in being a Jew, so that was the only way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">In addition, when I was making "Weapons of the Spirit," I realized that the way in which the film would be most effective would be if it was a Jewish film in praise of a group of Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It couldn't be a...a neutered film...wouldn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And that forced me to ...to absorb and understand as much as I could, to...to really be as Jewish as I could be in the making of that film. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But that it's...1t had to mirror, in a way, the...the reunion that took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> between Jews and Christians, that it had to emb...embody it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">As best as I could, as ignorant as I am still about so much of Judaism, it had to be uh Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And I'm very touched, by the way, when uh orthodox Jews are responsive to the film, as indeed the few who have spoken to me have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Uh, that means a lot to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  How do your parents react to your being Jewish, openly and publicly Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  My father was very uncomfortable with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">My mother, particularly since my father passed away, has uh really jettisoned a lot of the past taboos. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">In fact, she's probably made changes faster than I've been able to accept her changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Uh, that often happens that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh, I'm almost locked into my image of her; and she probably is far readier to change than than I am ready to accept her changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So she really, I I must say, now is...is...seems to be quite comfortable with all of this uh...and uh loves the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Has a tape of 1t which she looks at periodically, and uh very, very supportive and uh uh uh...and uh apparently quite comfortable with all of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  You had mentioned... And now let's move more to the film itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh, you had mentioned that there were three segments that you had left out. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">You had described one. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Can you describe the other two?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  It's funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Somebody asked me that a while back. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I...I was afraid when I mentioned that that you were going to ask me that question, because uh I tried to remember what the three were the other day and I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I remembered two of them, and I was missing a third. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I...1 know I'm going to be able to to... One was the names of the...of my dead relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The other one was the uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> they were from--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Uh, the original narration said my mother's family in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> ; and...and...and I took out Bialystok because I was asked to. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And it's the third request that, at this point, I cannot remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  Uh, let's talk a bit now about the making of...of "Weapons of the Spirit.". </span><span class="sentence" id="333">What kind...when you started to...to uh do the personal interviews, can you tell me something about the people who...who would have been the most important? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Uh, certainly to your parents, even if they didn't want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Uh, for instance, uh Magda Trocmé, who comes across in the film as this wonderfully determined woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  She's an extraordinary woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Can you describe your relationship with her, and what she is like now, in her old age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  It's funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I'm just moved thinking about Magda. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I love her. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I love her. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Uh, she is an extraordinary woman, extraordinary woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Uh... (Pause) If I may, I'm...I'm tempted to...to interject real quickly that we really live in a sexist society, uh one form of which is to discount often the...the female influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">You know, when it comes to rescue in particular, when it comes to rescuers, uh I'm convinced that women played a far more important role than men. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">It was often the woman who would be literally at the <span class="DLF">door</span> 1f somebody knocked on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">It was in...often into it in the <span class="BUILDING">mother's home</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">When the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> is told, you know, one tends to focus--when...when it's talking about leadership-- on Pastor Trocmé, who was an extraordinary figure whom I...I...[ admire inordinately. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">A brilliant, brilliant man. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Uh, but really, that...that combination of Pastor Trocmé and Magda Trocmé was an extraordinary combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She is the most direct, uh efficient, uh focused person I have ever known. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Uh, she uh... (Pause) She cuts through to things. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Uh, im...1mmediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">She is an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinarily practical person. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Uh, she really... You know, Trocmé--Pastor Trocmé--was a...a thinker. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Uh, some of that thinking ended up producing tremendous results; and he would...he did things. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But uh Magda Trocmé is truly a...a doer. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">You know, "What do you need now? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">What has to be done now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="359">You know, "How are you going to solve that problem?" </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It...it.... All practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And uh I...I...1 really sort of absorbed from her the sense in which that is what is most important in any given situation, in any situation of crisis. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Don't make a big deal about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Just, you know, figure out, you know, what needs to be done and do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  And that came through in the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  She is...she is a...a uh...she is a...a extraordinary woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  In the film, one of the things that you do is to develop an understanding that events took place not only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> but in all the surrounding hamlets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Can you talk about some of the people that you interviewed uh in those hamlets that did some rather special things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  You know it's a very important point, a very important point. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And I'm particularly interested in addressing it, even for history; because, in a way, I may be culpable of having uh obscured things even in...in the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You know, films are not footnoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Uh, they...they have to be somewhat linear - the form has certain requirements. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And to be sure, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> was the centerpiece of what occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was where Pastor Trocmé and Assistant Pastor [Edouard] Theis and Magda Trocmé were at the heart of what did occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Uh, and the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But really what...when it's talking about ...and you talk to Jews who were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , they are talking about the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They are talking about "Le Plateau"’. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They are talking about all the surrounding hamlets, and indeed some of the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Uh, what happened is symbols get created, and Le Chambon is the symbol. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Le Chambon inescapably will be the symbol. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But I hope that soon enough we will be able, having absorbed the symbol--the symbol having become sufficiently familiar to us-- we will then be able to realize and acknowledge that it is merely a symbol. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And, in fact, it's a symbol for the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> itself, there is very much that concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Le Chambon itself doesn't want it to appear that it is trumpeting itself in any way, particularly Le Chambon versus Le Mazet or versus Fay. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">You know, there were pastors in all those <span class="REGION">areas</span> who were actively involved in what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Uh, and for posterity it is certainly, it is crucially important that that point be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">In fact, it amazes me the point is made in the film... You know, it...it...it...1 thought it was made quite strongly in the film, about that surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span> was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And it almost amazed me how uh every reviewer ignores that and says Le Chambon, and talks, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And I say five thousand Christians in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , but it 1t often becomes the five thousand villagers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">People have great difficulty focusing on what, to them, are details. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Uh, but certainly for history [it] is important to...to underscore. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Yes, it was...it was the <span class="REGION">area</span> . '</span><span class="sentence" id="393">The <span class="REGION">area</span> surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Do you remember individuals? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Your camera does, but what I would like is, can you talk about one or two individuals in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , for this purpose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Well, I met people from...from all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I don't...I don't really think of them in terms of uh... I...I mainly...I found no differences, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The people in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Mazet</span> , uh which is the sister village to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> ... Uh, which by the way, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Mazet</span> was even more densely Protestant than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , if that is possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> may have had...I don't know, maybe roughly ten percent of Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I don't know if that figure is exactly accurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Mazet</span> was almost, I pre...] imagine ninety-nine percent, you know, Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And there were Jews hidden throughout uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Mazet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Uh, but when I think of individuals, it's hard for me to...to think of in...1n particular <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I...I really think of some of the people... Well, probably, the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> that I probably feel closest to, besides uh...besides the Trocmé family, uh are uh Henri et Anne Heritier (ph), who play a very imp...very important role in the film, uh who open and close the film, but who...who also... And played a very important role in the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , uh although nobody knew it at the time; because they were harboring the young Jew who was the forger for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And that was a key component in what went on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">People--Jews-- needed false...false ID's. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Uh, but they played an important role in my life, because my parents had a very surprisingly close relationship with Heritiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They did not have a close relationship with the peasants with whom they were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Uh, and didn't...maintained no contact with ...with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Whereas the Heritiers, they did maintain a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">When I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the '60's with my parents, which I did, uh we visited the Heritiers and uh said hello to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And my...my parents always thought the Heritiers were the the salt of the earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They always felt that way about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And uh...and the Heritiers's daughter, as I mentioned 1n the film, Eva uh had taken care of me as a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And uh I am convinced, by the way, now more and more as I uh pursue my interests in psychology and...and realize the extent to which we are shaped...shaped by early influences, uh that uh in...1n...on some deep level, I was probably uh very much influenced by the Heritiers as a baby and as an infant. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Uh I was actually uh left with the Heritiers for a certain period of time when my parents were busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And Eva, when my parents were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> --a near-by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> --they...Eva took me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And I stayed with her and her parents, you know, for a period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">In the film, Madame Heritier... (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION)
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">You were saying that you had been left with them for significant periods of time while your parents were working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I was actually uh... Eva Heritier, who was the Heritiers' daughter, who was uh...went with my parents when they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">My mother asked to take Eva with her to help her out, which was a big deal for the Heritiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Their daughter going to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And they trusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It's an interesting symbolism of that actually, because they...they trusted my parents to take their daughter away with them to...to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Trust ends up going both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Uh, but at one point, Eva took me back to... to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Uh, just her alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I stayed with her parents and with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And in "Weapons of the Spirit," Madame Heritier mentions the fact that that's where I learned to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Apparently, my first steps were taken under their auspices. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And, you know, it was very moving to me when she ...she mentioned that. [...[...</span><span class="sentence" id="435">1 don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I...I can't help wondering whether there isn't something faintly symbolic about that, that somehow uh... Well, that's where I started to walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  I suspect there's something symbolic, indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Uh, you just said something very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">You said that in the 1960's you went back with your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  But your parents had raised you...
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  ..uh not to be a Jew, and not to know your background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Tell me how that visit in the '60's came about, and what your parents told you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  That visit was a part of my uh period in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">desert</span> , so to speak, uh where I...I was a traumatized young man who didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So that is...1t's enshrouded in the same sort of uh mystery that much of my early life is. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I...I...and I remember very little about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">All I knew was that we were going back to the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my parents happened to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I didn't know why they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I had been taught not to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I was a very good, dutiful child, who didn't ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Uh, and uh I was brought to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my...I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And we visited the Heritiers, and uh... But none of this had any context, and uh really influenced me; except that it may have without my realizing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  How old were at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  I'm not sure of the exact date. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I think it was probably around '65, '66. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So I was twenty uh...twenty-one, twenty-two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  And your parents never told you more than that you were going to visit a <span class="NPIP">place</span> they had been...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">In...
QUESTION:  Not that people rescued them, or none of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Of course, interestingly, uh it shows how taboos linger on long after they've been ostensibly lifted. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">This was a time when I already knew I was Jewish and they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But it was nevertheless a time when I still didn't push, didn't... My parents, probably at that time they...they had imparted the information, but they didn't want it to matter to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They still didn't want me to ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They still didn't want to... So L..L..[ still never asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Uh, "How did you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Where...?" </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And uh, you know, I didn't uh...and I didn't realize the...the extent of what had happened in...1n Le Chambon there. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So uh I...I really don't remember that...that visit very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Uh, I remember...1 remember so much better, and I will share with you, uh a visit uh...the first visit that I made to the Heritiers uh as I was uh emerging from my taboos and was uh... I went with my wife in in the early '80's, and we knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You know, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> you don't always call ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You know, you just drop by. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And I introduced Barbara, my wife, to...to the Heritiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And uh Madame Heritier immediately left and went into another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and came back with this beautiful framed photograph of me as a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And it's something I will never remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was so touching that she had that photograph, and that she knew immediately, you know, where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">That it had been in some very accessible <span class="NPIP">place</span> that she could bring it out so quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And uh uh...I uh...I do feel a very, very, very special bond with...with those people and with that community. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Free association here, but I...I just thought of. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I've never mentioned this, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But a <span class="DLF">line</span> that will be forever with me which was so typically Chambonais, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Another wonderful woman who was in the film was Madame Bareau (ph), who was a very old woman even then when I interviewed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And uh in fact, the problem I had as the filmmaker was pinning her down and to sit for the interview, because she was always running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And as she would describe it, she was always running around visiting the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Uh, and she being uh already 89. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Uh, but I remember I had borrowed all her...her photographs; and all these people entrusted me with all their photographs, and even their childhood photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Which is .... They really trusted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I remember...I'll never forget uh going to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to return her photographs, and she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And I was thanking her, and she was anxious to say something to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And uh she interrupted me, and she said, "You know, I was talking to Madame Caritienne (ph)..."--another person. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And she said, "I just wanted you to know that we both agreed it would have been a shame if you hadn't been born.</span><span class="sentence" id="495">"--"S'aurait domage que vous ne soyez né." </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I've thought about <span class="DLF">line</span> so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It...it's so typically Chambonais, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Because, of course, it would be a shame if...1f anybody wasn't born. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But it was both very, very personal and very, very broad. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I still don't even know what the <span class="DLF">line</span> means. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">All I know is uh it sparked me, it's part of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  What would you like to add for the purposes of this film we have done ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  Well, I'd like to say something about righteous Christians, such as the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , to which I am increasingly devoting part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And perhaps particularly this: as we come to attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall into a trap. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to consider that all this was so uh...they were so few in number that they're not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Because they were few in number. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And, of course, they were few in number. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But that's precisely what makes them important. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Uh, and that somehow focusing on them will whitewash that period, that somehow it will make...give the world an excuse to feel better about itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Well, that's not the way it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">On the contrary, they make us accountable. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They prove that it was possible to care. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And that is what is necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">If we hand on only a memory of...of...of bitterness and hopelessness, then the world is off the hook. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">If the world ends up thinking that it 1s not possible to combat evil, that it is not possible to stand up, then...then it's off the hook. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Then it's not possible to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So that that...all those things we will quickly come to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But the...the...the trap is that we not, in focusing on them, start idealizing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That we not put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pedestals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">That we not make heros of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Of course, they appear to us unusual because they weren't many and there's something inescapably moving about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But it is crucial that we take their word for it, that what they did came naturally to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It was normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">It was no big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">That these people are no different from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That what they did is...we are capable of doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Uh, that uh they acted out of emotions and attitudes that were not heroic, larger than life uh...you know, emotions; but just very small normal emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Uh, there were...there were hero-types also during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There were people like Raoul Wallenberg or Andre Trocmé. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">These were people who had a...a compelling need to make their mark, to...to.... These were heros. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Most rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust were not that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They were very ordinary people, who simply responded appropriately to the challenge that they faced. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And they are the most relevant to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Very few of us are going to be Raoul Wallenbergs. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">All of us, every day, are faced with choices that involve recognizing that there is a need to help, uh a need not to turn away, a need to realize that we are responsible for something that is going on around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">That we can influence positively. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And we need to know--in a way, in the most selfish...for the most selfish reasons--that responding to that need will make us feel good, will make us feel uh peaceful, happy, uh will prolong our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Uh to care about other people is fundamentally to care about yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And that is part of what I hope uh people will derive from contact with...through <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> , through books, through films, will derive from learning about the righteous gentiles of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Because they existed, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">One of the questions I'd like to ask is...does concern making "Weapons of the Spirit." </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Uh, can you tell us why you made it? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">How you came about to make it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  I think it is no coincidence that somebody who was raised to forget ended up making a documentary record of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I think that uh maybe people who are raised with stories all their lives sometimes take them for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Uh, people who trust their memory often have maybe less of a need to document. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Because I have such a precarious memory, because it's such a challenge for me to...to...to remember things, I only feel secure if it's in some way recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">To me, it only exists when it's recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And uh I think that may have been a big part of this compulsive need to document uh the story of Le Chambon and--forgive me for saying so, but--to really document it as accurately as I possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">You cannot footnote a film, but I love history. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Uh, I love academic research. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I...I really wanted this to be as uh accurate as it possibly could be; bearing in mind that any film has to have a dramatic flow, even a documentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So, you know, you...you tell; but at the same time--and that was part of the reason that it took so long and was such a challenge, in terms of putting it together--to both respect the history, respect all the details, have every detail right, and yet not have it be boring. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Which was my primary obligation as a filmmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It had to...the film had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I think that uh my traumatized upbringing probably had a lot to do with my need to tell the story, and probably had a lot to do...certainly had a lot to do with the effect that the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> had on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Uh, you know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a little bit, about the influence of the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> on my life is that it really uh...1t happened twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It happened at my birth; but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really changed my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I really feel that they rescued me twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And perhaps it is that second form of rescue-- the rescue of me as a lost, rootless, depressed adult--that gives "Weapons of the Spirit" something of a universal message. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Because I do believe that many of us, even though my case may have been exteme, that many of us do have a need for positive stories to hold on to. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Legitimate, real realistic sources of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And that I had that need. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And... and the film-- the making of the film and the film itself--responded to that need. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And maybe that it's how to give the story whatever universal ramifications it may have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Yeah, that does it. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Ok, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Thanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">No, that's good. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That's good. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">That's the one question I forgot.</span></p>
