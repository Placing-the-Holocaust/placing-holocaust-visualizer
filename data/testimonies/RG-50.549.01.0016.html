<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  ...the past as much, you know, | try not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">So it's very hard and have some chronological, | mean | have some period after the war, certainly the early years, | have more, very strong impressions and feelings than be able to tell you exactly what happened at this and this time, you know, that kind of thing, so that's why questions help focus and put some structure in because | could probably talk for hours and it wouldn't, would be a little rambling, this is what I'm saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Life isn't so tidy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  No, and life isn't tidy, but | mean people get, | mean | don't know whoever is going to listen to this, so it doesn't even matter, you know, but | guess if you're interested in facts, then you need to guide me to some extent to ,
QUESTION:  Okay, let me start with the first fact because | actually need at the top of each side of the tape to have your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My name, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So is it the beginning of the tape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  (Yes).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Well my name is Anny, my official name is Anna Leiser and my married name is Kleinhaus, so my name is Anna Leiser Kleinhaus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  You say official name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Because I'm, people call me Anny and not Anna, so it's very strange when somebody does call me Anna , although at work people do, they see my name and that's what they call me. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So I'm used to being called Anny by my friends and relatives and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So that's my name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  | wanted to go back over a couple of things that struck me about the earlier interview if you don't mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you used a whole, you had been given a series of names and you'd also said that you didn't remember them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Since the interview, have you remembered more of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Well, | don't remember which ones | did remember at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But, one of them was Anny, as a matter of fact, and that why it was so striking to see that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">One of them was Shalot(ph) Donrae(ph), | think at some point | must have had a name Marie, you know, to make me as Catholic as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That's about all | remember, so | don't know if those are the ones | said, but at least those three | remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  So you started out life as Anna?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, | actually started life as Hannala(ph), which is, my parents were both from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they spoke Yiddish and Polish and certainly only gave me the name, let's say, Anna because they had to have some official sounding European, | mean Western European name. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But, my Hebrew name was Hannah and, or is still Hannah, Hannah , aS a matter of fact, and that was my maternal grandmother's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Until, my mom died about six months ago, and she used to call me Hannala still. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So, that's how | started out. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then as a kid, as | went through the war, | guess they made it from Anna, Anny because that sounded more French when we got into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And then with all the various papers that my parents got, mostly my mother, | was with her most of the time, they came, the name came with the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So if it was Marie, well, | was told, you know, you are now Marie, if it was Renee(ph), you are Renee, if it's Charlotte, | think the last one was Charlotte, Charlotte Henri(ph), that was the one before. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And a very funny thing happened after the war, when my father came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and my mother wanted him to meet the people who had, they weren't officially hiding us because we were paying rent there supposedly, but at least we were living there under false pretenses and | think they knew that we weren't exactly who we said we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother wanted to meet those people and they, so her name was, | can't remember what her name was, Tonree(ph) was the last name, which is a very French name, and they called him Monsieur Tonree when they first saw him, which was very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They never got used to the idea that we, actually even our names were not our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And so that's the story of the name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  How did you go about unlearning one name and learning another one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Well, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was, | was very, very frightened most of the time, | mean | was living in terror and | was so afraid that | would mix it up, you know, that | would just say, whatever the name was, was wrong, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I'd just try to concentrate, you know, and keep telling myself, you are now such- and-such. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But! </span><span class="sentence" id="39">was very frightened, | mean there wasn't, it wasn't hard in the sense of, you know, these are names | could pronounce and | learned French very quickly, but it was very hard emotionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">To not know from one <span class="NPIP">day</span> to the next who you were supposed to be and make sure you remember the right, you know, the right person to be that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  Were you ever afraid that you would forget your real name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  | don't think | was thinking about that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">| mean, the only concerns | had was to survive, | think, | didn't think about, ahead very much, and the only concern about, let's say ahead, was that my father should come back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , | didn't know where he was, but that's where he turned out to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That where my, those were my concerns was to remain alive and to have a family, but not whether | would remember who | was or who | wasn't, that, you Know, | think inside of me, | knew very well who | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So that, | mean after awhile, even though | was very young, | understood that it was just necessity and that it didn't really change whoever | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And | played the game, essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">| went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , you know, | played the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Just knew this is what you have to do and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You know, went for communion to the priest and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And at that time | must have been six or seven, you know, so, at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So | just did it, you know, and | knew it was a game and | knew, you know, sometimes | said | wish | were Catholic because it would be so nice, particularly wnen they had communion and they had the white dresses and, that | really envied, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And | did stand somewhat in awe of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , you know, it was extremely impressive, you know, when you go into a big <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the priest stand there and, you know, pontificates and the music and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">That was impressive and | kind of wished | could identify with that whole thing, but as my mother told me and many people repeated to me, that at the age of four | already had sort of taken leave of religion, you know, and didn't want to obey anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So that, basically, | think was sort of a refuge, it made me, in some ways, feel safe, you know, if | could be part of that group, | would be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And | don't think it was, in retrospect, such a deep religious feeling as some sort of feeling of being protected, you know, in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> you were protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And if you're part of that group, nothing happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So | think it was, you know, as a young kid, going with the children of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and our neighbors, | mean our landlords, going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on a Sunday, | was, | felt extremely alienated, you know, in one <span class="NPIP">aspect</span> , and trying to play the game and like believing that maybe | was Catholic and | could be Catholic and | could just proceed, you know, from there on and not have to worry about being who | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So it was all confusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Do you remember if you prayed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  | can't remember that, | can't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I, | mean | know all the prayers because | had to pretend, you know, but | don't, as | said, it's hard to be quite authentic, but being, knowing the religious feelings that | don't harbor now, or the anti-religious feelings that | harbor and have, apparently, since really childhood, according to my parents, it's hard to believe that | was swayed by anything more than the sense of, this is going to protect me, you know, so maybe it's worth doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But not, | don't think | had, | certainly never believed in Jesus Christ or anything of the https://collections.ushmm.org kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">| mean, that stuff was not believable, but, not that any other was, but | mean this in particular, | found very hard to stomach, so, but as | said, the atmosphere and the big voices and the, you know, the echoes in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and all the people that looked so, umm, you know, they looked very happy to be there and they looked like they were participating and so on, and | was participating but knowing | was a fake, you know, and, but | don't think | ever prayed to anybody with conviction. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So | don't think | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But | did pray, because | certainly had to go to communion and say all the words and go to confession and confess to sins that | made up. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You know, things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So...
QUESTION:  You were a performer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  | think to some extent, but that was part of the game, you know, if | had to change names, | had to change everything about myself, so I, but | knew it was fake, you know, | never, | think, totally took on the other identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">| don't think | ever did, | mean whoever | was, | mean | certainly got, I'm sure | got to some extent, you know, damaged by this whole experience, but maybe not, not as much as, if one listens to the scripture and you could expect somebody who would be much worse shape than |, | am, maybe, | think | was in pretty bad shape, actually, right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">| was really in, but nobody had time to pay attention, so | just had to pull myself together, | think that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">| don't think anyone had the time to pay any attention to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So | just had to survive, which | had learned, you Know, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So, that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  That's the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But, it's very difficult, you know, | am a very successful person, | mean I, and when, that's why | don't like to go to reunions of hidden children anymore because | feel that maybe I'm just an elitist, you know, and that's all there is to it, but |, there are a lot of people who are still whining about this and it's, | don't, really don't want to downplay it in any sense, but it's past and a lot of people have bad things happen to them in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And if you're going to just focus on those things, you're just not going to get anywhere and I, | can't, | cannot go and sit there and talk about this over and over and over. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And, you know, maybe it's denial for me which is, that's possible, too, | just don't want to deal with it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">| mean, I'm happy to tell you my story, but | don't think that what's happening in my life now or let's say to a great extent, has that much to do with that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">| think I've, | know myself pretty well now and I, | can tell, you know, where things are coming from more than just blaming it all on the war and everything of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  You're wearing, are those diamond earrings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Are those from your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Well, they're actually, my husband gave them to me, but all our families are in diamonds, so, | mean both my parents and his parents were both into diamonds, so that's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  One of the things | was curious about reading your family history, your father's history, is that you're feeling toward diamonds now, because you had talked about how, when you fled, your mother took the diamonds and threw them out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That's quite a dramatic image.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Yeah, | always try to, you know, save some, to try and sell them and that's all they had, was diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They had nothing, no property, no money really to speak of, but the diamonds that they were dealing with, they could try and sell to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So, that's...
QUESTION:  So the ones in your ears aren't part of that pile’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They're not. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">|, | didn't, there is nothing, | mean the only diamonds actually that survived the war, was my mother's engagement ring, but no, my in-laws, actually, because they came here, so they, they fled, but they fled as a family and they didn't really go through any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or anything, so whatever they took with them they, except for what they had to spend to bribe officials along the way to survive, they came with quite a bit of diamonds with them, so my mother-in-laws jewelry that she gave me along the years, those are really pre-war, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My mother didn't have that much to begin with and she didn't, she wasn't able to keep much of it and so, the only thing is her engagement ring, that's the only thing that actually survived the war and | have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So, that's pretty nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Do you wear it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">No, | put that away. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">| have my own engagement ring, which | actually very rarely wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, and my mom just passed away, you know, and it's very hard for me to take her jewels and put it on, | just put them away someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And | think, my daughter isn't married and if she does, at some point, | want to give it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Because she was very close to my mother so | would give it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So...
QUESTION:  You had talked about being in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> and the sweet potatoes or the sweet potato-like things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Ah, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  All right, I'm not going to ask quite about that, but you said there was a song about it and | was wondering of you remembered the song?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Umm, yes, there was a song that just came back to me not too long ago which had to do with getting up in the morning and having to go wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">How was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">https://collections.ushmm.org [Singing in French]. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So that was a song to get our, [French phrase], which is whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And [French phrase] was, is that sweet potato or whatever it is, | don't know if | remember that song. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It will come back maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">If | think about it, it won't, but it might just spring up at some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There's a fellow that lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> who is my childhood friend and he's now the only one alive because his parents died just over the last two years, they were in their 80's and his sister, unfortunately, was a very good friend of mine, and she died at age 21 in childbirth, so he's the only, and he seems to have a better memory than | do for these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">| mean, he actually went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had been hidden and looked up the priest who had been in charge of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it apparently has not turned into some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> and...
QUESTION:  Where is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  This is in Von Deen(ph), which is in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> and he recognized it, he said he really did and he took some pictures and he showed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">| don't think | remember it quite as well as he does. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we're the same age, so it's not a matter, he's six months older, so it's not a matter, | think | just tuned out a lot of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Just tuned it out, it was just too awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So | don't think | would really recognize it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  You were, until you were 10, you were the only child, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Did you feel more responsibility because you were the only one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Towards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Toward your mother, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Responsibility to kind of keep alive and keep going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Well, | think I, | took a lot of responsibility on, for that friend of mine who, because we were together and she was two years younger and as | was, | would say essentially, anorectic(ph) and she, but not anorectic in terms of throwing up, but just wouldn't eat, | mean | was just not interested in food, but not that | had an image of being fat or what goes along with anorexia these days, just, just so distraught that | couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But she on the contrary, being upset, she wanted to eat more, every time, So we were the opposite and we would go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and steal food for her at night and so | was, | felt very responsible for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">| don't think | felt responsible for my mother or to stay alive for any other reason than | just wanted to be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">You know, not for any particular reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">No, | don't think, | think, | can't remember if my mother, you know, felt or made me feel very safe, | can't say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">| think | did feel abandoned quite frequently because she was gone a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So I, no, | don't think there was any consideration of my mother, of me doing something for her, protecting her, https://collections.ushmm.org | think it was clearly the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Even though | didn't feel that protected by her, | felt more protected by playing the Catholic girl and going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You know, | felt a lot more safe than being with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And in some ways, when she didn't learn, she didn't know French very well and she learned it, you know, on the run and she had a pretty heavy accent, even though she learned the language, and so | didn't feel comfortable with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">| mean, | sort of thought she was going to get us into trouble more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And |, | don't know if | said that on the tape, but | was very nasty, | mean | was extremely nasty, and you know, just plain old angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And | threatened the people that she used to put up with the denouncing them to the Germans, thinking they're not going to catch me because I'm this French girl, you Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But they'll catch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And scaring people to death, you know, just scaring them to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And it was silly, | mean | was this six year old, | really wasn't going to go up to, and | knew that | was never going to do that and | knew that | was just as, as much in danger as they were, but | could go out and pretend to be whoever | was and they couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">You know, they didn't know the language or they didn't appear to be totally French, you know, and also | would really torture them, make them feel very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Some of them have, you know, they're all dying out now, but they reminded me of that frequently as | went back to visit my mother, which | did frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, | was not a nice person, not a nice kid, | mean just not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And you're interested in what's happening after the war, so after the war, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , | mean | was an absolute terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">| mean, a completely uncontrollable terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And, but | was smart, you know, and | knew | could get away with it because our class was made up of just really the dregs of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> and, you know, people of all ages speaking different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  That was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , so we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba(ph</span> ), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba</span> , and the neighbors, you know, were all so happy because the neighbor, the man, had been in World War | and he had been injured, in fact, in World War | and he had no love for the Germans at all, so he was, you know, very, very happy, even though in this war they didn't suffer that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He was too old to join and he was, anyway, he was injured, so he was really, really, really happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And then, so that's, you know, how we found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">| mean, the radios and everybody was just extremely, extremely excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So there was just a joy in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and everybody, people pouring out from every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , there was just thousands of people even though it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it looked to me like, you know, thousands of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">| really don't know how many they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So that's, essentially, what | remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And | remember then, somehow, my mother getting notice that my father had returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And leaving me there to go find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So she left me with those neighbors and so that, | remember that and | remember when she came for me, she had actually found him and we went back and that trip was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And it was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , you know, just one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with, not even covered, but some sort of tarp cover, that's it, and we traveled from there and it took days and days and days. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">| don't Know who was driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , | have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And it just, see, certain stupid things, | mean, I, | was still very nasty and very angry and at some <span class="NPIP">stop</span> there was nothing to drink except beer and | said that | would rather die than drink beer, you know, just as a, who knows why? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">You know, | mean if you're really, really thirsty you'll drink beer and | was thirsty, but | said | would rather die than https://collections.ushmm.org drink beer. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And | don't like beer to this day, so | mean, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Justa stupid, you know, detail that comes to mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And so we went back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  You went back to where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we had lived in was pretty much destroyed, so, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba</span> we had met a woman who had two children who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And she owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and her husband had been deported and she didn't know whether he would come back or not, but she had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with several <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and she said that she, we could come and live in her <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, for rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And so we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We moved, my mother, my father, myself, moved to that, we moved to the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had three flights. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It was like one of these <span class="BUILDING">railroad houses</span> , very skinny, everything was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> behind the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And there was no running water, | remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There was no central heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So we had to pump the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal stove</span> to do everything, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And at first, when we first got back, my parents and | went to a sort of an <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> in the Ardennes(ph), which is the hilly part, they call it <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , but in reality it's just <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , hilly part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and | think that was the only time in his life that my father ate non-kosher food. [</span><span class="sentence" id="217">end of side 1 of tape 1].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">It's the only time in his life your father ate non-kosher food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And it was really to get him back on his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">| mean, he accepted that, it was a necessity, there was no kosher food and he needed to just get back on his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So, we went, | think originally it was supposed to be for a month, but no sooner we were there, my mother took off and she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> because there were many people who were getting married who had been separated during the war and got together and she went to cook for weddings. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Not for money, you know, just out of, you know, community feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And so she left us and she would come back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">You know, she would be doing all these charity, volunteer and whatever kind of works, so she didn't stay the full month, but my dad and | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then we went and moved into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> that | told you about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  I'm just curious, when you saw your father, you hadn't seen him, for a time you didn't know if you would see him, you had been very close to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  | had been extremely close, so that was a terrible disappointment, terrible, terrible disappointment because, well, what you remember as a three or four year old from your father is very different from the way you see him at age eight or nine, particularly since there hasn't been a progression, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So, and | was extremely disappointed because he was extremely orthodox and wanted me to be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And extremely rigid in his, the practice of religion where, you know, he wouldn't allow me to turn on the light on the Sabbath, | mean he was extremely, extremely, https://collections.ushmm.org extremely strict and rigid and | could not abide by this. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">| just could, | didn't believe in it and | kept telling him that | didn't see how, after what he's gone through, he could still believe in this sort of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And so there was really a crack in our relationship because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You know, he tried, on other <span class="NPIP">fronts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">| mean, my father was not an educated man and he would make an effort and take me to the movies and | know that this was not something that he would have done normally, this is something he really did to try and regain some, some closeness with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">| mean, I'm sure he missed it, too, but he just didn't know how to go about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And | think in some ways, he was soiled, you know, as far as, why did he let himself be taken? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Why didn't he, why wasn't he the strong man | thought he was in, you know, protecting us all and why did he just disappear? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">| mean, he just, he was supposed to meet us Somewhere and he never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You know, and at that time, | think | had this certain resentment towards him for being my fallen hero, you know, why didn't, why didn't you protect us and why were you gone and why were you, come back in such a decrepit state, you know, you look terrible and, you Know, you can't really be my strong father. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You know, so | had a lot of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And | don't think | could tell him, | really couldn't, the only fights that we openly had was about religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And | think | then channeled everything into absolutely refusing to have anything to do with the religion because | got, you know, it was a little inconsistent, like angry at God like for allowing this to, and then somebody who allows this to happen, can't exist, just can't be. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So that was the end of my religious, and we fought about that for a very, very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Through my teens it was really bad, really bad because there were very few of us left, for one, of children my age who returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the majority of them were not observant and so, | mean their families weren't, and by forcing me to, you know, stay in on the Sabbath and not being able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">movies</span> like Saturday afternoon, | was cut out from a lot of social activities, as well, so | resented that terribly, terribly, so | was really angry as an adolescent. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">| mean, on top of everything else, | was not a, not a happy camper in my youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So | don't think | ever, | mean now, you know, my father has been dead for 20 years or more, | can understand what he was about and how strong he actually had been to survive this and to be able to rebuild a family and bring his entire family, his entire surviving family to live with us after having gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And making money just to, you know, feed all these brothers and sisters, | mean two brothers, a sister and his father moved in with us, into that <span class="NPIP">place</span> what didn't have water. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">His father, a sister and two brothers, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You know, and | just resented that awfully, | mean | wasn't, not charitable at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  How long had you been reunited with your father before the rest of his family came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Not that long because a few, when my parents, my brother was born in May, '46, so maybe a year or less after they had been reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that family, | think, moved https://collections.ushmm.org in with, my brother was clearly an infant, so | don't know if they moved in just before or, he was born, or right after, so that's not clear in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But they, my father found some smuggler and he paid him a lot of money to go and rescue whoever was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Where were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, they were actually in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They made it to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And | don't know how he found out about it, | really don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  That was going to be my next question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  | don't know, but they, they were people coming from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> and they tried to find people who were from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that they had been and then they would, | think it's just word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">On the other hand, they knew, since my father had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> since 1933, his family knew that, at least he had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they didn't know whether he, where he went during the war of if he had ever, if he had stayed or if he had returned, if he hadn't stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So | think they might have tried to contact the, you know, Jewish Refugee Agency and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So it was probably a little bit word of mouth, a little bit through official channels, you know, Jewish or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">| would imagine that that's how they found each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Because they knew at least to look for him in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where he didn't know where to look for them at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  So less than a year, obviously, if your brother was born in '46?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  After you got together as a family, suddenly the family dynamic changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Entirely. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Sylvan(ph)? [</span><span class="sentence" id="274">Greetings exchanged between parties in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and someone who came in -- tape turned off briefly].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  So, yeah the dynamics changed completely from being a family with just one child, to a family with two children and uncles and aunts and grandfather, to boot. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And | felt that my mother was completely unavailable to me, essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Because she was completely hassled, | mean, but again, | can see that now and as an adult, but as a child, | didn't see that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">| mean, it was just like now you get this stupid baby and all these other people living with us, you know, and now then we could maybe be happy or, you know, have, you're not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And then she was running all her volunteer activities on top of everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  So tell me what it was like, you're, what, 10 years old or something? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Yeah, about 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  And you've got a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without running water, with all sorts of people, many of whom you've never met before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Yeah, most of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  And you had said earlier, that this was a time when you really needed attention and you really didn't have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Yeah, that's true, | didn't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">At least, | felt | didn't have any, I'm sure that | did have, you know, | mean my basic needs were taken care of, | mean | had food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and | had clothes and | went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and | even, well | don't Know if in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a little later, | got piano lessons because | was dying to play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So they bought me some kind of secondhand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upright piano</span> which | still remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Do you still play?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Not much, no, | always say I'm going to go back to it, but, | used to play quite well, but | didn't really pursue that very much, after 15 or 16 years of age | gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So again, it was a matter of feeling, you know, in that first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad house</span> , as | said, so the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was all the way in the front, behind it was something which was more, was the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> | would say, and then in the back of it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> that wasn't used at all, and then in the back of it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And the first, | don't know whether months, how long, but the first, for sure, month that we lived there, my parents and | slept in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> used to collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was extremely frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It was, | don't know what it was made of, it was some cheap <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood bed</span> and it would just collapse and we would find each other, you know, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And my father had these incredible nightmares and he would be screaming, aside from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And | had my own nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So it was a nightmare, it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And then, again, | can't say for, it's six months or a year, they bought me some kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> where | was in the so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and the family, the additional, the uncles and aunts and that group, moved to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , so we had the first, <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> , the family, the owners, had the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> right on top of us, the owner's husband did not come back from the war, so she was with two children by herself, so she needed the rent, and then the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> was for the two uncles, the aunt and the grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But food was all at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , everything, laundry, food, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Without <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> , without any, you know, fancy appliance of any kind, so in some ways, in some ways it was almost worse than during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Because during the war, | had some kind of stability, | mean for the last couple of years when | lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba</span> , as | said, | was in terror but it was, to some extent | had accommodated to the terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">There was not that much unpredictable that was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We had our air raids and we'd run off and go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , by that time https://collections.ushmm.org | had one name and that didn't change any more and | had some sort of routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And my mother, when she was there, was there for me, there was no, she had all these people that she was hiding and so on, but still, | felt that she was there, you know, for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We would go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> together on occasion and we would do things together, whatever they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But then she disappeared, essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She was diluted so much to such an extent that in some ways, | felt more abandoned than during the war, even though | wasn't afraid for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">| mean, and so my, | think a lot of that anger was due to the fact that | was just lost, you know, just, it felt like | was to take care of myself plus take care of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Which | had to do, | mean | had to babysit for him and, because we couldn't afford any help, and my mother was just unable to do everything, she was doing care for my brother, you know, day and night, so when | came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , | mean | had to watch my brother,

QUESTION:  Wait a second, hold it, hold it, you're skipping over this. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">How did you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  | don't know, | just knew | wanted to be something and doctor seemed extremely heroic, so | guess | was very impressed by the doctors | went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You know, they seemed to have such power and, you know, everybody was very deferent to doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So, | don't think | was in it really to help people, | think | was in it more for interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So, that's what | was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And, so in order to do that, | couldn't stay in that, see that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was, as | said, in shambles, it was the remnants of a pre-war, very, very fine <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , but because, so the system in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was that if you went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , you could get into <span class="BUILDING">university</span> after graduation, you didn't need to take a special test. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But, if you went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , you had to take a very, very thorough sort of baccalaureate type of exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So, and you had to, in order to get to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , at that point, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flemish town</span> , so you had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flemish</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">| didn't Know any Flemish, really not, | mean | just knew a few words to talk to the cleaning woman and | didn't have a lot of interaction with her because when she was there | was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and | hardly ever saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So that was a bit of a problem because you had to have an admissions test in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flemish</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So, | don't know, see people think maybe I'm lying, but I'm not, | mean | went and | took the test and a friend of mine came with me and she copied everything from me and she didn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So, but | don't Know, | mixed French and Flemish and whatever | could think of, you know, in the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">| mean, the, | don't know what the questions were and | only had three years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and everything was, really, | Knew nothing https://collections.ushmm.org really well except reading, that's all | really knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Well, the rest | knew, math was terrible, because | didn't have the elementary stuff, you know, | was really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And so | got into this extremely, extremely difficult <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> that had six years of studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And in order to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , you had to take the classic tract, so the classic tract was Latin and Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Plus Flemish, of course, which was the main, plus six hours of math a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">| mean, this was really horrible, and my experience at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was terrible, just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and even though it was really a <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">public secular school</span> , because in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> they have, as they have here, a Catholic system that is parallel to the public system, | obviously, so the people who came to the <span class="BUILDING">secular schools</span> were not Catholic, or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they chose the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">But | still felt very alienated and really not welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">| felt there was real anti-semitism there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> in general it was this feeling at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  Well, | couldn't tell because the Jews really lived very much in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , even though they didn't live that much physically a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they lived spiritually and culturally in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was very little mixing. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So the only traces of anti-semitism were, | have a friend who lives down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , she's several years older, and we sometimes speak Flemish just kind of out of, you know, out of fun and there is one kind of joke we have, is if we haven't heard from each other for a long time, she'll greet me like in Flemish, [Flemish phrase], like, are you still alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And she said that's how they greeted her when she came back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , like, , gee, you know, | thought you were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So, that was the atmosphere among the Flemish, although many had been hiding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They really then had a concerted effort to rescue Jewish children and hide them, but obviously, there were a fair number of people who, and you know, it's, | couldn't even say that it was vicious, it was like having no clue and say, oh, you know, well, we thought you were dead, kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But just imagine, when you have survived something like this, you don't feel that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And the other thing that contributed to my feeling pretty bad was that we had <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturdays and my father didn't let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And so, | was already really, you know, culturally deprived, | mean | was, | don't know how | managed to do well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because | did, but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and putting them together, but not having a coherent view of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was, | missed, you know, a sixth of math every week, which was algebra and going on to, you know, higher math and |, | really, | had a lot of trouble catching up and staying afloat. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Missing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week, and trying to make up, whereas the six hours, | mean the five hours that we had were hard enough, you know, to try then every week, by the time you catch on, there you go, you're missing three or four or five hours of really important work. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And then | had to go after Sabbath, pick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly, they let me in their https://collections.ushmm.org house, but like barely, and try and copy it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">| mean, it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then, when the Jewish holidays came on Monday and Tuesday, so now here we go, | miss Saturday, of course, Sunday no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Sunday | can't go pick up the notes because Sunday the holiday starts early and we have to go through that routine of bathing and getting ready and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And so by Wednesday, | mean you can imagine how | felt when | got to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">| mean, the people were talking about things | had absolutely no clue about and the teacher said, "Well, you know, you want to observe your religion, that's okay with me, but I'm not going to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">You'll just whatever, you know, do it yourself". </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So we did, this girl and myself, and we had six miserable years. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But somewhere in between, in 1951, | believe it was, my father's immigration papers, he had applied to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1933, and of course, the Americans had no intention of saving a single Jew so they made sure he didn't get the papers and they figured by, like , In '51, he'd be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But in '51, his number came up, and so this was in sort of the middle of the Korean war and there was big panic in Europe that this was going to turn up to be World War Ill. And so my father said, "I'm not going to survive another war, | just, | will not be able to do that". </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So we all left and we came here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  All, meaning...
ANSWER:  My mother, my brother, myself, my grandfather and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">| mean, the other people were married and on their own and they weren't on his quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">| mean, they did, they couldn't have come even if he had wanted them to. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And, so we came and my mother had a brother who lived in Borough(ph) Park, and his name was Blitz(ph), and he had escaped just before the war, on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and came then that route, with his wife and three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And so he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span> and he helped us get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and | hated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span> was even more orthodox than what | had seen and my mother hated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Because my mother could go along with the Antwerp orthodoxy because she, but that was just too much for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She really hated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  In '51, did you fly, take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , how did you...
ANSWER:  Took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We took the Queen Elizabeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And it was a fun trip, | mean, but we came as immigrants with the suitcases and the, we left our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , actually we didn't vacate it, because my mother really wasn't sure that this was going to work out, and so she thought we better stick it out and see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And, because by then she had established herself, she was happy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , she had all her fingers into, her tentacles really, into all sorts of pots and she was really a leader of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And she had friends, they had a social life, they played cards with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">She and | used to skip away occasionally for a weekend to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , you know, go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> because she loved the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And we'd go to movies together and we just had a good time, basically, she and |. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">My father was pretty https://collections.ushmm.org much on the side, he didn't participate much in these, but he didn't mind, you know, that they occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So...

<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  What was it called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  That was the , and | think it's still ongoing, it was part of the section. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Then there were other youth movements that were very left wing which were , and they were very Socialist and | couldn't go to that because my father would have killed me and | didn't like the other one, so my friend and | kind of parted the ways, parted ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And in fact, | think | was also not much of a, | wasn't functioning very well in a group, | was really an individualist, too, | couldn't function, | got bored. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">| just got bored. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">| went with Regine just to be with her for awhile, and | really couldn't, | just couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So | went to a couple of camping trips, you know, for the summer where we, and | had a very good time, |, on those trips because that was sort of further away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was less control. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And then, if you're with a bunch of young people camping, there isn't that much you can do on a Saturday that you, you know, that you could or couldn't do, we'd go for hikes and we'd do all these things, so it was actually a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And so we came here and...

people appear who are primitive, in my view, because, see, even though my parents didn't have a formal education, my mother was anything but primitive, and the people who they associated with, again, had no education, but were very, they were street wise and they were, they had a veneer of worldliness about them because most them had been, they'd been to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , so they, they had a better, they had a much wider experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And they had

roaches there and we had left our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was not luxurious, but compared to that, it was clearly <span class="BUILDING">Trump Tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And so, | felt very bad about this whole thing and when they left, you know, at least we got, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was ours and it became a little easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And in fact, then | started having a good time because my mother's brother who left, | told you, with his three , he left with his three kids on that last <span

do all these stupid things and they wouldn't, and | couldn't, | was just, | couldn't understand, but | liked her a lot and so | had fun, | think it was almost like an anthropological study at that time, like what are these people thinking? </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And then we had to move to, so my mother didn't like it there in <span class="DLF">Borough Park</span> and we moved to

<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, by the time we left, | actually like it because, hey, as | said, | was graduating, | knew | didn't really know anything, but | thought | could fake it. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And | was dating, although | didn't like the scene, there was something kind of nice about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And | was becoming more independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So | don't think | was looking forward to going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">| think | was, by that time, beginning to open up to the possibilities of much more freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And the possibility of meeting a lot more people in may age group. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> it was extremely restricted and, as | said, there were some that were going to these religious things which | wasn't going to go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">There were some that were going to the non-religious one, | mean still the organized Zionist group, | couldn't join that because my father wouldn't let me and besides, as | said, I'm not sure | was that type. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And then there was a group of very rich kids, or at least acted as they were, as if they were very rich, and they were very sophisticated and had their hair done in nice <span class="NPIP">places</span> and we couldn't afford that. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So | wasn't really comfortable with them either. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So | was quite isolated and had just, and then the pressure was on to just get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">In all those groups, you know, and | mean | couldn't deal with this at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">| simply couldn't deal with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So | had two or three friends, girlfriends mostly, til the end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And we'd just meet in each other's <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and commiserate, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Complain about how terrible life was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And so that's how it was until | graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And a time, about, when | was studying for my big finals in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , it was around the holiday of Pentecost, you know, , my, one of my uncles, Myer, you know, who had lived with us, and his wife had taken an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for the month of June at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seashore</span> and they invited me to come for that holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So | came and | brought all my books to study my final exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And | was studying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> because it, it was the month of June and it was not high season yet, there were just families with young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And this one guy, you know, approached me and he was a young man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , but just a few years older than | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And we started dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So then | had sort of a good time for awhile except that he wanted to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And | just didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">| mean, | just did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">You know, | just knew that | had to hang onto what | had said and | wasn't going to cave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And so that, didn't have a nice ending, but | started <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  No, | didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> , | wasn't accepted into anything, | just took my luggage, | went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night train</span> , | got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at six in the morning with coffers and coffers, you know, because my mother had packed God knows what, and stood there and had no idea where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And finally managed to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and there was a Jewish , aS I've figured, well, I'll go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">At least somewhere to park my stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And | did, went there, and put my stuff and immediately figured that | didn't want to stay there for very long because it was one of these orthodox things again and | said, "That's really lovely, I'll stay a couple of nights, but I'm not staying". </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And so there were some other students there, obviously, and they helped me find a, you know, they helped me through the ropes of getting a newspaper and finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And | found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And then | went to register and, honestly, | didn't know for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">| really didn't Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And I'm standing on <span class="DLF">line</span> , you Know, in front of the register, you know, the teller essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And there was these two Swiss girls and they're talking and we started talking, | asked them what are you registering for, https://collections.ushmm.org and they said, "Oh, we're going for a degree in biology". </span><span class="sentence" id="886">| said, "Okay, I'll do that, too". </span><span class="sentence" id="887">| mean, it sounds really idiotic, but that's how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">So! </span><span class="sentence" id="889">went and | got a degree in biology. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">https://collections.ushmm.org Tape 3
ANSWER:  And so we registered, the three of us, and we became really good friends, in fact, I'm still friends with them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Once every two or three months, she'll give me a call, just out of the blue, one of them, the other, then | hear from this, from the second one, , just Christiana(ph) is the one that I've kept in touch with, but | always hear about Christiana. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And that's how | started a biology degree and somewhere in the midst of all of that | met my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">| met one woman who is an Israeli and I'm still very friendly with her, in fact, she called me on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And she was in the <span class="BUILDING">interpreter school</span> , oh yeah, that's the other thing, all the girls who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> were in interpreters. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">| didn't want to do that because | still had my views on a real job, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And something that | was interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So biology was just, just great. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">My friend that | met, Elana(ph), was an Israeli woman who was just a lot of fun, she's a great gal. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And she was in <span class="BUILDING">interpreter school</span> , so we became really good friends and | had these two Swiss girls, Christiana and Josiana(ph), and we became good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So immediately | had a group of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And so, of course, my parents were very worried about, is she ever going to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And | said, “Look, I'm going to study, | don't know what I'm going to study, but I'm going to study something and I'm not getting married". </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So they were very upset because there had been several candidates in between that | didn't mention from this fellow whom | met at age 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">There was a bunch of them and | didn't like any of them, | always had an excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And one was even a physician and, because | said, well this is uneducated, this is this, this is that, what's with the doctor? </span><span class="sentence" id="907">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">| said, "I just don't love him. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">| don't love him. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I'm not marrying somebody | don't love and that's that". </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So, they were getting really concerned and by that time | was 21, 22, and this is really getting to be the old maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So everybody was concocting, you know, to have me meet men. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So unbeknownst to me, there were relatives of his in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> who, he had relatives there who he used to come and visit for holidays and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">They told him about me, about this nice Jewish girl and, you know, when you're 22 and somebody tells you, nice Jewish girl, you say, oh, yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">The same family told me about him and | said, "Anybody who needs to be introduced by his uncle, | don't even want to know about". </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So, but | didn't say anything, | said, "Oh yeah, really". </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And | knew some of, there were a lot of American students studying medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Those who were essentially there because they were Jews because there was clearly a quota of not admitting Jews to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he was one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  So he's American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  Well, he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , came here during the war, went back with his family, of course, in 1946, but for some reason or other, his parents couldn't get used to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> again, they went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So he was essentially raised here from https://collections.ushmm.org the age of four on. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Went to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia College</span> , did extremely well, but for the quota reason didn't make it into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> right away, they wanted him to wait another year, it was very complicated, he said, screw you, I'm going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">So he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And so this is how people were kind of planning to get us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So | knew some of the other medical students who were there and | told, so | must say, | had seen Sylvan(ph) and | didn't know who he was, but he was really handsome. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And | said, gee, and he looked totally non-Jewish, blue eyes, light hair, just what | needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And so | really wanted to meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And | told someone, "Do you know this guy Sylvan Kleinhaus?" </span><span class="sentence" id="931">He said, "Yeah, he's in, you know, my medical". </span><span class="sentence" id="932">| said, "Just point him out to me because | want to make sure that | don't meet him". </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So next time we are in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> together, he says, "That's him". </span><span class="sentence" id="934">| says, "No". </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So he said, "Yes," he said, "Why no?" </span><span class="sentence" id="936">| said, "Oh, that's a long story, I'm not telling you why". </span><span class="sentence" id="937">So we met and interestingly enough, he knew my friend Elana, separately, independently. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And so we became really, the three of us, you know, very close and she was dating another medical student at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And so we met and we Started to date and we got married about a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Even though | said, I'm not getting married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  Did you have a religious ceremony?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Well, that | didn't mind, you know, that I, see | will go for the form, | still, I'll go, | go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> now and | attend on the high holidays and | bitch throughout the entire thing, but it's, but | am, it's an ethnic identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">| feel in some ways, extremely Jewish, | have very, very strong feelings for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , my brother lives there and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">My brother who was born in 1946, with his children and | love his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And all, practically all the cousins that were born to these people who lived with us, as | told you, they all live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And, and | went there for one summer after | graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so | really took a love for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">For a variety of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And | think that's probably where the war has marked me the most, is that | feel so strongly identified as a Jew and | cannot stand it when anybody makes any kind of comment, you know, about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or Jews or, it just makes me completely crazy, even though | don't agree with everything that the Israeli government does and it's not like I'm a totally right wing fanatic, not at all, but | just can't stand criticism from people who aren't Jewish, | just cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">| always feel that it's tainted, that is' not strictly on political grounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">So to that extent maybe | have a certain amount of paranoia that | can trace back to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">| mean, maybe that's where it's most visible.</span></p>

id="1208">And | said that they have to help me in the letter, and at least grant me an interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">So, one or two of them did, and one in particular, | told him, "Look, everybody says that it's no point, there is no point training women because they have children and they don't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I'm trained, | have children, but | want to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">So, are you going to help me or not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">So he could say, he couldn't say no, so he got me a job as a research associate for, at <span class="BUILDING">Rockefellow University</span> which is, obviously, very prestigious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And | was there for about a year and then

business, he looks very happy and | really like his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And more than that, | think she likes me which is a rare occurrence because |, | know exactly what not to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And | also know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And Karin is in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and she's going to be,
