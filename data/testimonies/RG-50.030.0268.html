<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION: Morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Could you tell us your name and where you were born and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER: My name is William Dowdell Denson. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born the 31st day of May, nineteen hundred and thirteen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> , <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION: And can you tell us a bit about your education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, I was actually educated in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">In nineteen hundred and thirty when I was 17 years of age, I was appointed to the United States military academy at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I entered there in July of that year, and I graduated from there in June of nineteen hundred and thirty-four. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I resigned my commission in the United States Army and was accepted as a student at <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> , which I attended from September of 1934 until graduating in June of 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">That is the basis of my undoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION: And how come you got interested in the law?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, I guess that was kind of natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My great-grandfather on my mother's side was a member of Congress in eighteen hundred and fifty-five and continued there until <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> succeeded from the Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">At that time he became a colonel in command of the 37th Infantry Regiment of Alabama and participated in the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vicksburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was a lawyer and enjoyed the law apparently very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">On my -- his son, rather, would go back -- take the <span class="REGION">maternal side</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My great-grandfather that I just described had a son by the name of James Rendar (ph) Dowdell. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He also was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And, in fact, he was a chief justice of the supreme court of Alabama which is the highest judicial court of that state. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And my father, I'm skipping now to my pappy's side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he, of course, was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And his father was a congressman and the United States attorney for the northern district of <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So I sort of come by the law in a natural fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION: And going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER: I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> in --
QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER: Excuse me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER: I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> back after I graduated both from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and from the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty-two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty-five, at which time I was ordered to join the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the United States Army, 3rd United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I was a member of the judge advocate's section of that army. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I joined them in February of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Now, my duties in the judge advocate's section in the Headquarters 3rd Army was to have charge of the administration of military justice, which was familiar to me because of my teaching also of military justice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> from '42 until '45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION: Can we go back just a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION: When you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , the Nazis had taken over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And when you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws had been passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Was there any discussion at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> about what was going on in Nazi Germany that you can remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER: No, sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">At that time, and because curriculum was kind of rough and tough for a country boy like me, I didn't concern myself with much more than trying to study the cases that had been assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And there wasn't much discussion either from the professors, nor among the students as to the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And nothing -- I knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws other than the fact that there were indeed Nuremberg Laws that had been passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And as such, they were discriminatory highly, and something that hardly anybody could be proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But there was never any teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> about the Nuremberg Laws at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION: When did you first become aware of oppression in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER: To be honest with you, the first that I really recall was Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That was in November of nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, if I'm not mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">At that time the pogroms had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And actually they started even before then. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But that was the event that produced a notoriety in that I think the whole world knew about it from that time or from that time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And it was rather a shock to me, because I had a number of very dear friends who were Jewish that I had grown up with in <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So it was- 1t came as quite a shock to me that that sort of thing was then taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION: Did you know anything about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> that had been coming from Europe to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and was not let -- people were not let into <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and then they weren't let in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I never heard that until I became more involved with this matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">War crimes and indiscriminations that had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION: So that until you became involved in the war crimes trials, your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER: It was negligible. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I knew even less about communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION: So tell me, did you want this job in the judge advocate's office?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER: I would say this, that probably I recognized it as a professional challenge and one that I would certainly like to entertain. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I considered myself fortunate to have received the designation in that capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION: But you didn't know what you were getting into?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER: I certainly did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I would do it again, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Even now that I know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I think that I started to say I wouldn't change anything, but I'm sure that upon reflection I might have changed a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But I couldn't tell you right now what I would have changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION: When did you first become immersed in the kind of material you would be confronting, the kind of evidence you'd be confronting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER: Well, in <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that was true in all of the combat units. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The war crimes investigating teams were groups of individuals, lawyers, investigators, and supporting personnel, that investigated atrocities as the combat troops uncovered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And some of those things drifted into the Headquarters of 3rd Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And our judge advocate -- I mean a staff judge advocate at that time was a colonel by the name of Colonel Charles E. Cheever (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And he had an assistant by the name of Josephs that was handling the war crimes aspects at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They were later handled by a classmate of mine, as I said, Colonel O'Connell. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But in the conversations, the existence of some of these atrocities did become the subject of our conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So it was, I would say, before, slightly before, not much before May 7th of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And, of course, May 7th was the day when hostilities ceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION: So you learned something before you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER: No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">May 7th of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I went to Headquarters 3rd Army in February of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> at the rear echelon of Headquarters 3rd Army was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I think it was there when I really first learned anything about t he war crimes proceedings that were being uncovered and the events that took place thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION: Can you tell us some of your first impressions as you began to look at this evidence for the first time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER: Well, the first time that I ever had a chance to look at the evidence actually was, I think, in the beginning or middle of August of nineteen hundred and forty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And those were some of the reports and findings that the war crimes investigating teams had made to the judge advocate's section in <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Patton was the commanding general at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And the teams that would be actually at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was just 17 kilometers west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And at that time we were conscious of what was -- had gone along at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I didn't actually visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until I think some time in July of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were in the-- what they call the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And 17 kilometers didn't particularly interest me at that time at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION: What was the nature of the evidence that you were looking at when you --
ANSWER: At that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION: From the war crimes team?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER: From the war crimes team were reports that were sent in by the investigators and interrogators. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And to look at them and to read them was not to comprehend them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Not that they were written in incomprehensive language. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But the events that they described were incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And at first there was sort of attitude that this -- some of these people had too many Schnapps when they were writing the reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But that of course is in jest. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Never was any such feeling toward the investigators at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a feeling of that, the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION: There were a number of lawyers with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">About 30 lawyers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER: In the --
QUESTION: That were working with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER: At that time we had quite a number of lawyers in the judge advocate's section. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And in the war crimes teams there were actually quite -- I don't recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But investigators, interrogators and lawyers were 40-, 50-odd individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION: Did you talk about this evidence that was coming in? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Were most people equally as incredulous as you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER: Well, I'm sure that they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I don't think there's much doubt about the fact that anybody that came in contact with them, with the evidence, of course, they saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was a credible matter to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But from the secondhand on, it was an incredible matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And the biggest problem that I had after I was designated to prosecute these case, the biggest problem that I had was believing or getting testtmony that could be believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Because of it's nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Not that it wasn't true; it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But the events that were depicted were so horrible, were so sadistic, were so monstrous, that they were incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That's the only way to describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I was a skeptic. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I didn't believe it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I didn't start believing it until I really started digging into with the concept and with the authority that I was going to prosecute the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> case. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">At that time when I started talking to witnesses, and I heard events there that were so out of <span class="DLF">line</span> , that they were incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I could give you an event that perhaps might depict it. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">In all of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there was place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called the <span class="INT_SPACE">arrest bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">arrest bunker</span> there was some <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> which were called the <span class="INT_SPACE">standing cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They were instruments of torture in reality because they were so small and so constructed that it was almost impossible for -- almost impossible--it was impossible for a prisoner who had been committed to one of these <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> to either lie down or to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He had to stand in order to be within the confines of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And these S.S. men who were in charge of the <span class="INT_SPACE">arrest bunker</span> would put prisoners in there for punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They received no food, no water, and no chance to sit down or lie down, or change their position for three to five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And sometimes longer if they lived that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Then at the end of the period of time, they'd take them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And if they were still alive, they would sit them down to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> with two or more liters of water in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Well, the poor emaciated prisoner starved by thirst and absolutely out of his mind took the liters of water and guzzled it down immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That caused the stomach of this emaciated prisoner to protrude out. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">When that happened, the S.S. man who was there would drive his fist into that stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Or if he couldn't sit, throw him down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and then stomp that protruding stomach with his heel, rupturing the walls of the stomach, and the prisoner died of an agonizing death. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now, looking at you, you don't look like you believe it either, but it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was one of the things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And it happened not only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , which was the case I was concermed with at that time, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION: Let's stop now. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We have to change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">TAPE #2
QUESTION: Bill, You gave us an example of what would make you be skeptical.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION: What caused you not to become skeptical?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER: Well, being skeptical we looked around and we finally got a hold of other witnesses and interrogated them and found out that some of them had witnessed this same event that I just described to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I interrogated those witnesses very, very closely and very, very carefully to find out as many details as each of them could recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And low and behold the details that these other witnesses gave me dove-tailed very closely with the incident that I just recited to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And because they dove-tailed so closely and because of this corroboration, and I knew that these witnesses had not had a chance to get together and make up the story among themselves, that that event had to have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It had to have happened because two people couldn't have imagined the same type of misconduct. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was so far out, it was so atrocious, so heinous, that the normal individual just couldn't imagine that sort of event taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Nevertheless, when somebody from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> gave me that type of story, another witness from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the same thing, another from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I began to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And finally I got to the point where I could believe most anything because it all did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That was the thing that made a believer out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But it pointed up a problem that I was confronted with. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">What <span class="BUILDING">court</span> now is going to hear these witnesses for the first time with such a horrible event. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Who's going to believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And it's only natural that the members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> wouldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So what we had to do was to sort of condition the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in this sense that I first introduced evidence of events that you would expect to have occurred in a penal environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Slapping around. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Little more force; knocking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Down to beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">In that various degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And in that way it conditioned the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> for the bizarre events that I just described to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And that was a problem that we recognized and was a major problem that served as the subject of our conversations as counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And when I say our conversations as counsel, I had assistants that were trained lawyers, wonderful men. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we would get together after each session and discuss among ourselves to what extent we thought we had conditioned the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> so that we could bring on testimony of these bizarre events that took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And it seemed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in all cases except one found the accused guilty of committing war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And, well, the nature of the sentences that they imposed, they must have believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We almost hit the jackpot in the Mauthausen case. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">In that case we had 61 accused in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> that we were trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And of that 61, all of them were found guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">58 of them were sentenced to be hanged and three of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So that was almost the jackpot. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">If they had all been sentenced to be hanged, that would have been the jackpot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION: Were you looking for the death sentence in most of the cases that you were trying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Well, let me tell you this: Looking for it 1s one way to put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">In the commission of a war crime, the maximum punishment is death by hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And depending on the circumstances, any lesser punishment as the circumstances may dictate in the mind of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So all of them, all of them were subject to having had the death sentence imposed upon them after having been found guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So that to say were you looking for it, there was some that were more guilty than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And that was the second problem that we had; that of comparative sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">When you try a number of people at one time -- and you may wonder why we tried so many at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We had the 61 there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , we had 40 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , 45 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , and 31 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We had to have representatives out of every phase of operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> otherwise it would be only part of a picture that we were trying to establish by evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it was important that we established the criminality of the operation of each one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in every one of its phases. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Because the charge that we were making was that each of those individuals that sat in that <span class="DLF">dock</span> as an accused either aided, abetted, participated in the common design of subjecting these individuals to beatings, killings, tortures, starvation and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So it was important to have representatives out of each phase of operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And in that way the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> could make a finding that it was a criminal operation in its entirety. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We had some 3,500 accused that had been denounced in the war crimes case at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And we couldn't try individually each one of these on a case on the basis that we tried the parent case. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Those were the cases that I tried, the parent case. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You couldn't spend that much time trying each one of these individuals; 3,500. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We'd still be trying them. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So it was perfectly lawful to have the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> condemned as a criminal operation in its entirety. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Then cast the burden upon these 3,500 individuals in groups of one, two, up to as many as might be essential to paint a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And let them explain away having established that they were there at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , at each one of these four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , any one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And in that way you can't say that they were presumed to be guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But the burden of proof was shifted a little bit to the extent that these individuals had to come forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Some of them come forward and say, "You got the wrong person by the wrong name. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">My name is Schwartz and this other man's name was Schwartzenegger you're talking about." </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And another one of the defenses was that "I was there for such a short period of time, I didn't know that this was a criminal operation." </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And even another defense was, "I was ordered to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Well, that was no defense at all for the simple reason that for -- superior orders is the name that they give this defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">For that to be a defense, the order itself that was disobeyed, if 1t was disobeyed you could be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">That's what superior orders is a shorthand of saying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">These individuals would come in there, none of them ever put on any evidence to show that anybody was ever shot for disobeying an order given them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The S.S. men I'm talking about or the Kapos that worked for the S.S. -- and remind me to tell you about the Kapos, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But the superior order defense was predicated upon the order being a lawful order. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Well, the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were illegal under German law. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">German law still had statutes against murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They had statutes against assault and battery. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They were crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And they had individuals in the <span class="BUILDING">penitentiaries</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for committing crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So that what was taking place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbirg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> were crimes under German law. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So that the law was -- the order that was given to beat a man over here, or to hang another man over here by his wrists, those were against German law. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And since this defense of superior orders didn't prevail, that was out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And on that basis we were able to take the findings of the parent trials, those four cases that I've just described, and introduce those in evidence and then let the accused put on any evidence in mitigation that they may have at their command. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I would like to point out at this time that any time any accused was brought to trial, he was furnished with counsel by the United States government; that is American counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And he could have German counsel of his own choosing. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In other words, we gave these accused in these cases all the rights that a citizen would have had he been tried for a crime in the United States district courts or the <span class="BUILDING">federal courts</span> of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So we gave these accused that protection that our own citizens would have received. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So that it's very difficult to understand the complaint that some people have with these trials saying it's nothing but victors' justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That isn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">That isn't true at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They had a fair trial just as our citizen would have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Now, I may be straying all over the lot here from what we started out with. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I wanted to explain to you the fact that the defense of superior orders had no place in these trials at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And prior to that I think I wanted to point out to you that there were circumstances in these cases which required a great number of accused in order to establish the criminality, criminality of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION: Each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to be proven as --
ANSWER: A criminal operation in its entirety. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION: In order that you could then try all these thousands of other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER: That is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Otherwise you would have to establish the same thing for each one of these individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And with 3,500 individual cases, that just wasn't a feasible proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION: I'm going to ask you something about the witnesses and the accused. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But I wanted to go back a little bit to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Who made up the judges?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER: The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was called a <span class="BUILDING">Military Government Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">Military Government Court</span> was one aspect in which the United States government participated in the war crimes program in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">First you had the I.M.T., the International Military Tribunal at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That was no part of what we were doing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Then you had the subsequent proceedings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And that was tried -- those were tribunals that were appointed by the Allied Control Council but were not international in nature but were all U.S. citizens that were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And the third was a <span class="BUILDING">Military Government Courts</span> which were <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> that were appointed by the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Now, the first <span class="BUILDING">Dachau court</span> was appointed by General Lucien Truscott, who was the commanding general of 3rd U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And that was done under the aegis of the staff judge advocate for the European Theater of the United States Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">USTEF, we called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And these individuals that were appointed to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> were senior field grade officers with the rank of full colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And they were composed of anywhere from seven to nine officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And they were presided over by a general officer, usually a brigadier general or a major general, as the case may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And these were men of stature in their profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And they acted as fact-finders as well as applying the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Now, the law was neing given them by what was known as the law member on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He was usually a lawyer who had had extensive experience and was learned in the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And these <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> functioned under the aegis -- the <span class="BUILDING">Military Government Courts</span> that I had anything to do with, were under the aegis of <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> 3rd U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The 7th Army started to have a war crimes program and finally was decided that all the facilities that were necessary were present down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which was the site of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And the war crimes program of 7th Army was folded over into what they called the War Crimes Group, whose <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION: We're going to have to change the tape again, so let's stop for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">TAPE #3
QUESTION: So let's get back to the judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You were explaining who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">There was one lawyer in this group, the rest of them weren't lawyers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER: Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We'll start with --
QUESTION: You can answer the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We're okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The personnel of this <span class="BUILDING">Military Government Courts</span> , as I said, consisted of seven to nine individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">One of whom was a law member. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The balance of these individuals were career professional officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They had usually had anywhere from 25 to 30 years of experience as being in the armed services of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Were all, as I said, selected as men of stature and high moral character. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And they were selected by Headquarters 3rd Army as the appointing authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And were taken also, I might add, with the consensus of the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of USTEF. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That is European forces of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And they were men who took their duties very seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They had all served as members of court marshals in the course of their careers as regular army officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But the law that was given to them was given to them by the law member of that <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and there wasn't but one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The law member was the individual who advised the rest of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as to the admissibility of evidence, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You couldn't have nine judges sitting up there and the question being asked down here and one member says -- when the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> objects, one man says, one judge says sustained and the other one says overruled. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So that was solely within the province of the law member. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But the law that was applicable was international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And they were charged with what was known as war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And a war crime that these people were charged with were violation of the laws and usages of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Now, they -- that term, violation of the laws and usages of war, embodies the conventions that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had entered into. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they, of course, were signatories to the Hague Convention of nineteen hundred and seven, and the Geneva Convention of nineteen hundred and twenty-nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I might point out at this time that the war crime that we are talking about, violation of the laws and usages of war, included not only these conventions that I've just mentioned, but also they included the course of conduct of combatants in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There were a lot of customs and usages that had existed that were all embodied in the term laws and usages of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You know, the conventions were taking place solely for the purpose of really making more civilized the practicing of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> concerned itself with non combatants, and the Geneva Convention concerned itself with the conduct of combatants toward prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And those were the two particulars that we had 1n each one of these charges that we had for these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">That they violated the laws and usages of war in that pursuant to a common design to operate these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to kill, to beat, to starve, these were the offenses that they were charged with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION: The charge or the indictment of the crimes against humanity was not applicable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER: No, sir, 1t was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">These -- these violations that I prosecuted these accused for were just as much a part of their law as their statutes in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So there was no retroactive effect of what we were doing here at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">There were no new crimes that were established at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We tried them for what had been on the books for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Nobody could get in there and say that this is ex post facto in what was carried on by the <span class="BUILDING">military government courts</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION: Do you think that was a problem in the other cases?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER: I don't think there's any doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">There was some people that wouldn't have even dared touch them because of the feeling that they were ex post facto. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Waging aggressive warfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Every warfare is aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">The means by which you carry it out, that's something else again. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But crimes against humanity, that's as broad as the world is big. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But we had nothing indefinite about what we did at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I've been in a lot of arguments on this, so I don't want to get started. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We could be here --
QUESTION: I'm curious, because there were three indictments that were possible in these war crimes trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION: Crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Crimes against humanity was the least used?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER: That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Because it was least known. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was the least recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION: And you agree to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER: I agree with that, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">There'll come a day I'm sure as we become more civilized and conduct our wars in more civilized ways, where you got to let authority expand. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And that takes in crimes against humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Because humanity, when you start defining it, is rather broad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION: Whose idea was it to have these parent trials essentially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER: Well, I think that was born of necessity more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">You can't say that that was product of any one man's brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The law chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> participated in putting together the proper procedures so that -- it was not an individual contribution of any one man. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But it grew and has been growing and will always grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION: When you talked about the fact that the legal system that was used or the procedures that were used would be those used for American citizens, you're really, I think, talking about military?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER: I am -- I am indeed, except the constitutional rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">In other words, the constitutional nights that are guaranteed to every one of our citizens when he's confronted with being accused of a crime were afforded to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They had the nght to counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They had the right to have witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> we had a man by the name of Dr. Evan Katzenelenbogen who had some friends in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that he wanted -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> that he wanted brought over to the trial at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We brought them over, but he didn't know that they had gotten here. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And he got up and told the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that he had made this request and never been fulfilled at all, in one <span class="NPIP">respect</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And in another, that the witnesses were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">That he is sorry to learn that the witnesses were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And we had them sitting out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">witness room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They were not dead at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They were arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They came in and testified. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Not too much for Dr. Katzenelenbogen. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But they said what he wanted them to say, but they also said what also occurred in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION: You said that American attorneys could also be used by the accused?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER: Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They were. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And they had not only American counsel, but also a German counsel as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And when I told you that my status changed from being a colonel in the army to a civilian, I was what was known as a War Department civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And there were quite a number of Americans that were over there serving as defense counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And they had access to those as well and some of them also served as prosecutors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION: Could the Americans decide whether they wanted to be a prosecutor or whether they wanted to be a defense attorney?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER: Well, I think basically they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But more -- it was more determined when the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> were organized, and when they went -- when the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> were organized, the individuals that were named in as prosecutors or as defense counsel, they were selected from this pool of lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And when they got in that pool, some of them preferred to be defense counsel, some of them preferred to be prosecutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And I think that those facts were made known and were considered by the appointing authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But the final say was the appointing authority which was General Truscott and later on General McNarney’ and General Clay’. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="361">Joseph T.

<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION: Did Jewish lawyers have a particular -- were they given particular dispensation not to have to defend if they didn't want to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER: Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We had Jewish lawyers that acted both as prosecution and as defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">One of my counsel assistants in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was very able young lawyer by the name of Paul Gooth (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Paul had been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And Paul was educated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> and took his law at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and was a very able lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And a very young man at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And he was tremendous help to us in the preparation of the Dachau case and the Mauthausen case. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He was superb, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And I point him out because of the fact that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">But he did take on the prosecutorial role. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And his contributions were invaluable, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And I had another one by the name of Berkowitz from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> ; Camden/<span class="REGION">Philadelphia area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He was in the Flossenburg case. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He started out with Colonel Shaw, and Colonel Shaw became ill and I replaced Colonel Shaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Mr. Berkowitz was a superb lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And he did more to keep co-counsel straight in the trial of Flossenbiirg than anybody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And he did that by making us all remember that we owed a responsibility to these accused. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And the responsibility we owed was to give them a fair trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And that brings to mind the fact that when we were first called altogether in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> case, which was the first one of these parent cases, the commanding general at that time was Lucien Truscott. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And he called us all together and said he wanted us to be fair, but he wanted each one of us to be able to look back upon what we had done in the future and be proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So that we should conduct ourselves in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And fairness was the first requirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And with that as a send off, I thought it was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And that became a part of Mr. Berkowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And Mr. Berkowitz also was -- made contributions in procedure and knowledge of substantive law that we all appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION: Tell me what -- this is your first set of trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The first time you are confronting this information, confronting accused within this kind of a situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">What is this like? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">What happened during this trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER: Well, let me say this: At the time I started to try <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , I had tried literally hundreds of jury cases and bench trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So the fact that this was a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and I was appearing before them where the fact-finders were in the majority like normally be in a jury, and the judge was a law member, it wasn't anything that was unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But the feeling that I had at that time was that I wanted to establish a record that would depict a true picture of what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And that these individuals accused over there, while they were essential cogs in the machine that the picture was of, the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that it was essential that each one of them be given an opportunity to do whatever he thought was within his power to acquit himself and any of his confederates, 1f you please. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I use that term confederates advisedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">But actually I had no qualms of conscience about wanting to hang any one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Because I had actually convinced myself to the point that I was perfectly willing to put the noose around the neck of each one of them with my own hand and spring the trap with my own hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I was that convinced of their guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And so in mass, it was a mass of guilty individuals that should be put away. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And that's the way I felt about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We're going to take a break now with another tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER: All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION: Let's stop the tape now. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">TAPE #4
QUESTION: Bill, could you describe the atmosphere at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> trials and what that was like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER: Well, let me say this: That the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> had been one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in which operations in support of the war had taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">True it is, they were making shoes and uniforms for the Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And they had the necessary machinery in there for sewing and mending and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Well, when they decided to have these trials down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , they ripped out all the insides of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that I yust described so that there was one large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And it was so large that it was the size of the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which could have been 200-250 feet long and maybe a hundred feet wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And they made <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for the prosecution and <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for the defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And one end of the -- accused in one end of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , another end of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And at the far end was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dais</span> that was raised about two feet off of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So you had to take really two steps to get up to where you could stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , you called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">What we call -- lawyers call <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">judges' bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It was his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> that went practically the length of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And under which revolving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> were placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And it would seat up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dais</span> approximately as many as 12 to 13 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So it was adequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And being elevated, it was high enough to command respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">That's the whole idea of having the judge on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And it was a dignified place. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">American flag was back on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> which was behind the members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> who were seated in front of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And then in front of them there was the witness stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And the witness stand was a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> sort of like I'm sitting in here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And that was placed in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And about maybe 15 feet from where the members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> sat, the accused sat either on the left- or the right-hand side of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The accused had nothing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They occupied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> which were like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> that didn't have the upholstery. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> -- seat of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> folded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And they sat on -- the accused in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> sat on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> 's left in that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> they started out on the left and moved over to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I never asked who moved them, but I went in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> one day and it was that way, so that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And the accused each had their own separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And in front of the bank of accused that was seated there were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counsel table</span> for the accused. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And there the lawyers and their assistants sat and took their notes and had their interpreters seated there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And getting back to the interpreters, the language barriers, they were not overcome there like they were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We had no instantaneous translation. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We had -- the trials were conducted in English and in German basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So we had an English and German interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Then if a witness, we will, say for example was Polish who spoke a little English and spoke no German, we would have an English-Polish, German-Polish interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So that the order rather went this way: I as the prosecutor would ask the question in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That was then translated by the English-German interpreter into German. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Then the Polish-English interpreter would ask the question to the witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Now, if the witness understood any of these languages, he could get sort of a fix on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But we kept the language of the witness as the controlling language to this extent that he would then have less time for his reply. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">In other words, the interpreter who spoke Polish and German would translate after my English-German interpreter had spoken, translated into Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Then the witness would answer in Polish, and it would come back the same track. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So it was sometimes kind of confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> had the official -- these interpreters that I just described to you were all known as official interpreters. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Then as a prosecutor I had my own interpreter and so did the defense counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So there was a bank of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We were never without people. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We always had enough accused for an audience at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But the rest of the seating in that covered enough rows there to seat approximately 250 to 300 attendees. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And as I said, when we started out we had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only at sentencing. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was not sitting, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> finished there activities and our clients came back and visited us. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And the attendees were basically in that only the families of the accused were there but also there were representatives of the different nationals that were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We had no Russian observers. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We had no Polish observers, except the London Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The London Poles sent observers, and they were religious about attending all the trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> finished, then the court reporters all -- the newspaper reporters all came back and flocked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And at that time they had been broadcasting these proceedings over the <span class="BUILDING">Munich radio station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And I must say, after they started broadcasting, business did pick up. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We had a lot more attendees that wanted to see what they were hearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Because some of it was still incredible to most of them, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But when they saw the witnesses and heard them testify, they began to believe also. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And the attitude, although I must say it was hard to determine, there never was any raucousness or any boisterous conduct of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It was always carried out on a dignified <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But sometimes there would be laughter at some activities that had occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And when some of the interpreters got fouled up, everybody was amused at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But there was very little amusement other than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION: Did you ever talk to the citizens of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER: Well, in the early cases there was fraternization ban which gradually was relaxed, if you please. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I talked to some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And some of them I talked to didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Some of them I talked to thought that this was just a put-up job, and we were just trying to really administer victors' justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But the broadcast did a lot to allay that. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Because that brought them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And then they could see, they could hear with their own ears and see with their own eyes what was transpiring there. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And they could understand the German, which I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I listened to it enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I learned "Gaschlopen"’ "Gestorben" and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But I could speak very little German. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I could tell when somebody was talking about me and that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But when these people, particularly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbirg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , we had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only in those trials practically every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION: Those were in the same <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER: The same <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION: What was your impression of the accused? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Did you interrogate them also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER: Oh, in the very beginning, yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And then there was some feeling that maybe we were taking undue advantage by interrogating them. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">You know, in continental practice they have an interrogator that interrogates the accused and he has to answer questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Well, these accused didn't have to answer questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They were informed of the right that they didn't have to answer questions unless they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But in the beginning they were bragging about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They would say, "Look, , you killed X Y and Z here." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">He said, "X Y and Z plus." </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And he would tell us about other instances that he had really taken a man's life. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And they were in -- other instance it was a braggadocio attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Because in the beginning these accused thought it was a game. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And they really didn't appreciate the significance and the seriousness of it until after the trials got underway. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And was it ever brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when *Note: perhaps "Geschlagen"; "beaten". </span><span class="sentence" id="518">those who had been convicted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and a lot of them were hanged there in April of 1946, end of March or April '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">A different attitude prevailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They began to realize that these trials were for keeps. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And it was up to them to defend themselves, if they had a defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But in the beginning when you asked me did we interrogate them, yes, I interrogated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And so did most of my assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">In fact, I don't think I put a witness on the stand that I didn't interrogate. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But I never put one of the accused on the stand because that wasn't my prerogative. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They were free to take the stand if they wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION: But you could use the evidence that you gathered in the --
ANSWER: That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I could use that as prior inconsistent statement if it was inconsistent with what he said on the stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION: Did anybody ever contrite?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER: Nobody was ever -- contrition is -- I don't think is a word in the German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There never was a single individual that said, "I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Have mercy on my soul." </span><span class="sentence" id="534">On the contrary. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">There was one man that I prosecuted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The name was August Haigrubel. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Haigrubel was one of the Gauleiters of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Wasn't but two, and he was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And the scoundrel had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">His name kept coming up when we were preparing the Mauthausen trial, but nobody knew where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We didn't have them in custody at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">We had, as I said, 3,500 of them, but he wasn't one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So I finally figured out that he may be at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So I called up Mr. Justice Jackson who was the chief counsel and chief prosecutor then. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And asked him if he had a man by the name of August Haigrubel. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And he did a little checking and came back on the phone and said yes, that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I said, "Well, sir, if you can release him to me, I think I've got a very powerful case against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And I can hang him as high as Haman." </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And he says, "Well, counsel, that's pretty high." </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And he released him to me and Haigrubel took his <span class="NPIP">place</span> as one of the accused along with the 60 others that I tried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But when he was on the stand, he was the most arrogant, contemptible, and contemptuous individual you ever ran into anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And all I did was try to build up that attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I wanted that <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to drink deeply at that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And he filled the bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He was sentenced to be hanged, and he was hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And it's been about 15 years ago at a party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> I ran into an individual who witnessed his execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And he said that as they put the noose around his neck, he said, "Heil Hitler." </span><span class="sentence" id="558">No contrition of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">A lot of the accused did ask forgiveness after they were walking up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> to be hanged, but that's the only time. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And it wasn't very many of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Practically none. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But never in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION: Would it have made a difference you to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER: To me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION: As a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I don't mean --
ANSWER: As a lawyer, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">None whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION: What about the witnesses? </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Was this a difficult -- was it difficult to get the right witnesses --
ANSWER:  Well, it was a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It was a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Because we had witnesses from all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">As a matter of fact, I was assigned a little DC-3 to collect witnesses after we had located and identified them. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I have to tell you about going in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> trying to get them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">That was a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But getting back to the identity of the witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We first got it from the war crimes investigating teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They were of a tremendous help to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I think maybe we ought to stop here for a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Let's stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">TAPE #5
QUESTION: We were taking about witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">You were searching for witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You're okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Bill, we ended with your starting to talk about your search for witnesses and what they were like for you and who you would choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Well, we got our leads from the war crimes investigating teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And recognizing we had to have witnesses that were credible and we had to have witnesses that were knowledgeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Those were the two things that were fundamental: Credibility and knowledgeability. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And we would take the information that we got from the war crimes teams and use that as springboards. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And interrogating witnesses, we would go from one witness to another depending upon what sort of impression he would make on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We evaluated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And he may have known of an event that had occurred that others who would have more credibility than he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So we would look around for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And in this search we -- I was allocated a DC-3 in which to collect the witnesses from all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Of course, as you know, the inmates of these four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> came from practically every <span class="NPIP">spot</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And so those were the sites of the witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Because most of them that had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">A lot of them remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> ; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">That was a fertile source for acquiring witnesses, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But we would get these witnesses in, and they would tell us these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And we would make an evaluation as to their credibility and their knowledgeability. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Best ones we kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Of course, we couldn't run on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But we tried to get the best because we would listen to one and he would tell us about somebody else that knew the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And we would try to track him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And I'm -- I've got to tell you about a man that assisted us greatly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">His name was Kohl, K-o-h-l. Mr. Kohl was a devout communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I'm sure he was a communist when he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> probably was a communist, because of that he was put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But he had a mouth full of gold teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And the Germans had an affinity for gold wherever it was; and particularly for those prisoners who had gold teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So that many a man lost his life because he had gold teeth in his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Well, when I met Mr. Kohl in the process of trying to get witnesses from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> for the Mauthausen trial, he opened his mouth and laughed and there was this expanse of gold teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Just like a sunburst. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I said, "Mr. Kohl, how in heaven's name did you survive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> from nineteen hundred and thirty-eight when you were incarcerated there until the liberation in nineteen hundred and forty-five in April?" </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And he says, "Colonel, I never smiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And when I ate, I never chewed with my mouth open." </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So I'm sure that's what he did to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Because when he did smile, as I said, it was daybreak, and it was lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But getting witnesses out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They had a staff judge advocate over in 7th Army there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> that was opposed to our taking witnesses out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was in the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The only part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> that we had access to was the principal part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tulin</span> (ph) <span class="BUILDING">Air Force Base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And that was -- otherwise you had to go through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> to get down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Well, the staff judge advocate there under General Mark Clark said, "You can't take these witness out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the <span class="REGION">Russian Zone</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And I asked to see General Clark, and I went in and I spoke to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And he was a very cooperative individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">He said, "Colonel, you don't have to take them all out at one time, do you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I said, "No, sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And he said, "Will five at the most do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And "Yes, sir," I said, 'We can shuttle them back and forth from now on." </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We only had about 30 that we had to get out so it wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But we had that type of reticence that was really keeping us from preparing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was located on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Enns River</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And most of those individuals who were the occupants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> were Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And they had come from around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">As a matter of fact, they had the Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , Kurt von Schuschnigg“was a prisoner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So it was terribly important to us to establish a liaison that we could work with to get these witnesses out. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And Mister Kohl was the man that did it with his gold teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">He had a card index there of addresses of the people, I'm sure all of them were communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But Lord bless them. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">At that time, and I must confess, at that time I didn't know a communist from a Nazi, or anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They were all individuals to me at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And they were trying to assist me in discharging my duties. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So I was very happy to have Mr. Kohl come in and testify and exhibit his gold teeth at the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Although I must say, it shook his credibility a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But when he pressed his lips over his teeth, it made quite an impression on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And they were human beings, the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They had a reason to believe that Mr. Kohl was telling the truth and that he did keep his mouth shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And it was something that was terribly impressive to me that an individual could control his muscles to the extent that -- I guess when your life is involved, you can do many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And Kohl did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Well, I guess I was wandering here about the witnesses that we had, and the problems that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I guess <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> posed the most serious problem because most of the witnesses that knew the most were from that <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Now, we did get a lot of witnesses out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Because those are the people that had no <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to go back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They had been bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Or their families had all been destroyed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">They had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So they were in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And we took those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And those that could make the best impression so far as credibility and knowledgeability were the ones that we used to make our cases. “</span><span class="sentence" id="664">Kurt von Schuschnigg was Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from 1934, when he succeeded the murdered Engelbert Dollfuss, to 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">In March 1938, he was forced from <span class="BUILDING">office</span> by the terms of Anschluss with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION: Can I ask you to describe what credibility and knowledgeability meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Credibility involves many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The way that you sit in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> on the witness stand, your demeanor on the <span class="DLF">witness stand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">How you express yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Even though it may be in a foreign language, the facial expressions that you utilize when you're expressing yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">All these things go to the matter of being able to enable the fact-finders to tell where the truth lies. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">If you get an individual that's going to be close-mouthed and going to tell you only those facts that advance his interest, you can tell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It comes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And that's the reason why credibility is a matter for the fact-finder and never a consideration for the appellate authority, or in our case, the appointing and confirming authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Oh, I could tell you a lot about that if you want to talk about Ilse Koch sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But credibility is terribly important. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And it was important because we had bizarre things that we had to get the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And if you had had a closed-mouthed individual there talking about, describing event that I previously described to you, nobody is going to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But if he got up there and said it with the feeling that it was terrible for him to even have to talk about it again, to recall it, it's bound to make an impression so far as a fact-finder is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">That's what I mean about credibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION: Did you have people who were reluctant to be witnesses because they were frightened or they didn't want to reveal again what--
ANSWER: Well, the only reluctance I think they had was recalling again the experiences that they had endured. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I don't think anybody was afraid to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I don't think there was any coercion of any kind of character, either pro or con in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">But I think that to recall some of the experiences that they had endured, it was terribly hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I had one man testify by the name of Arthur Haulot. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He was the minister from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Not a preaching minister, but a minister of state from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And he had been snatched away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ’. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And he was a learned individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Dignified man. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And one night while he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I think it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> that he was incarcerated in, he was so hungry he couldn't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And that had occurred not once but many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But this time it was terribly painful for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And he remembered a crust of bread that his fellow prisoner had tucked under his arm to safeguard and eat it at some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And he found himself easing - stealing, if you please - that piece of bread from his fellow prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And he took it back to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And then he started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">To think that he had sunk so low due to the treatment that he had been receiving there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , that he would steal from his fellow prisoner, who probably needed it just as badly, if not worse than he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Well, needless to say, that crust of bread found its way back to his fellow prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Well, when Brother Halleau delivered himself of that testimony on the stand, you could have heard a pin drop in that <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Everybody was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And they were moved by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I was moved by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And I think all the judges were moved by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But that was the type of witness that are few and far between. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But I say few and far between. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Few is the wrong word. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">There were multitudes of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But not all of them did we have access to. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So they were jewels when we found witnesses like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Another one was the name of Yoe-Thomas He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">A very interesting individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And he has since written a book entitled The White Rabbit, which you might get and read. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It was his experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And how his life was saved by a male nurse that I prosecuted when I tried <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">The male nurse's name was Dietzsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But to make a long story real short here: Dietzsh ran the <span class="INT_SPACE">typhus ward</span> in > Arthur Haulot was a Member of Parliament from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> imprisoned in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau Concentration Camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">He served as a Vice-President of the International Prisoners' Committee of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> where they were trying to develop a specific typhus like they were trying to develop one for malaria down at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And the guinea pigs were the prisoners, and they were dying right and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And Yoe-Thomas had served as a liaison between Churchill and DeGaulle. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And he was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And he couldn't spend two successive nights in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">The Gestapo were close after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">They finally caught him and they boxed him up and sent him off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Broke all his fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Pulled his fingernails out. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Everything you can think of to torture him. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">He wouldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And he was sent there with some 20-odd other Britons and Frenchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They had been collected by the Gestapo as being part of the French underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And they were destined to be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So Thomas was a wing commander in the air force of the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He was an organizer himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And he went to work right away to try to protect his comrades that had been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And they were beginning to get down to where the 20 had gotten down to possibly a half a dozen or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And something drastic had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And he talked to Dietzsh who was a prisoner, this male nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And made a deal with Dietzsh to try to get some of these remaining individuals into this <span class="DLF">sick block</span> they had there with typhus being treated, and protect them that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And they were changing identities. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Well, one of the prisoners whose identity had matched one of these six men was changed and was just about to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And he died, and he was able to swap identity and became a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Well, it finally got down to poor Yoe-Thomas. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And they found out that Yoe-Thomas was in there, and they said, "Well, bring him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We're going to get rid of him." </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And the way they had hanged the other, they didn't hang them by breaking the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">They strangled them to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The meat hooks that you see in a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> with the slab of meat on it, those were in the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And they would take one of these prisoners and hang him up by the neck until he strangled to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And that was the thing that Yoe-Thomas had to look forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Well, Dietch told the S.S. man who came there to bring Thomas out. "</span><span class="sentence" id="754">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">He's got typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">You can have him. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">He's got a fever of about 103. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">That if you can take him out, he's yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">But you may get typhus if you go in there and get him." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He said -- and Dietzsh says, "Why don't I just stick him with a syringe and execute him here? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And you can go back and tell the commandant that he's dead and you saw him and he's dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And Yoe Thomas later was buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">He was taken out as a corpse. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And as soon as he got out of sight, he got alive again and got out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and escaped, and was picked up by the Russians and they sent him back to the Germans on the exchange of prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">But he lived to tell the tale and wrote a book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION: We have to change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">TAPE #6
QUESTION: Continue the story about the male nurse Dietzsh who saved --
ANSWER: Yes, I would like to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Because Arthur Dietzsh had been persecuted by the Weimar Republic and was persecuted again by Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So he had spent most of his life in confinement of one form or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> he became the male nurse because he was a man of education that he had educated himself actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And as a male nurse he was an assistant to a Sturmbahnfuhrer, I think they call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">A Major Ding-Schuler, who was Kraut that had some artistic qualities about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And he was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">He had M.D. And had specialized in diseases and immunization. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And they put Ding-Schuler in charge of this block which they had set aside as a <span class="DLF">hospital block</span> for the purpose of developing some sort of immunization against typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Typhus was the plague that was raging all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I think it started up in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> actually is I think where they had the first cases of typhus, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And as those people spread down south, was sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But when the advances forced them out of the camps, they spread it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> that were located in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So it was terribly important to get some sort of specific for typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And that was Ding-Schuler's job. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And he selected this male nurse as Arthur Dietzsh as his assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he educated Dietzsh, who already was educated in other matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But he became a very confidante -- much of a confidante of Ding- Schuler's. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And they talked about what was going on in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And how <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was losing the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And they each recognized at that time, and this was back in January, February and March of 1945, handwriting was pretty much on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And Arthur Dietzsh having access to Ding- Schuler, and Yoe-Thomas got himself in the <span class="DLF">typhus block</span> and got access to Ding-Schuler and convinced Ding-Schuler to go along with his scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And that included Arthur Dietzsh as the male nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Because Arthur Dietzsh was a hands-on person in the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And they conceived this plan of taking some of these poor guinea pig prisoners who had been infected with typhus when they were dying, switching their identity with Yoe-Thomas and his friends, those five British-French friends that remained out of the group that came there originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And one by one they were able to get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They finally got down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yoe- Thomas</span> , and his twin hadn't died yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">So 1t was getting close. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And they were asking to have Yoe-Thomas brought to the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> for execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">As a matter of fact, they sent an Unterscharffihrer, I think was tech sergeant or something, down to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to escort Yoe-Thomas down to the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And Ding-Schuler said, "Look, typhus is a pretty contagious disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">If you want to go in here and pick him out of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , he's yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Be my guest." </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And the Unterscharffthrer said he had a wife and some kids at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he would like to avoid that if he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And he said -- I mean Dietzsh said, "All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I'll kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I'll inject him with the syringe and you can take him out." </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Well, they finally had a man who was his double. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He died. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And this is according to Dietzsh, believe it or not, but he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And Dietzsh went to this corpse, injected it with hydrogen peroxide of all things. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">That gets into the heart and creates an embolism, and death is pretty certain. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And speedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So they said, "Now you can tell them that he's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And if you want to, you can take the body back." </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And they said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You just assure me that he's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Let me take a look." </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He took a look and he didn't know Yoe-Thomas from Adam's house cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But he went back and reported he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Well, that saved Yoe-Thomas' life. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And Thomas wrote out on a slip of paper, "To Whom It May Concern, that this man, Labaro (ph), Arthur Dietzsh has saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And any consideration that you can give him when he's brought to trial --" because Yoe- Thomas had told him every one of you going to be brought to trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">All of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">That's how he had his entree to Ding- Schuler. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And he gave him this slip of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And Arthur Dietzsh saved his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">But he didn't save it for long in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">He went out the <span class="DLF">back door</span> as a corpse, was turned over to the Russians who picked him up on an exchange of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And he was then sent back to the Germans on this exchange by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He escaped a second time but not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">However, the one thing I want to say about Dietzsh, when he did this, he did it because I think in his heart and soul he knew that this is a man that deserves saving. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">They had had a lot of conversations together, Dietzsh and Yoe- Thomas. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And Ding-Schuler and Yoe-Thomas. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">So that he had the cooperation -- Dietzsh had the cooperation of his boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And Yoe-Thomas was the boss of both Schuler and Arthur Dietzsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that tried Dietzsh gave him ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And I think the reviewing authority cut it down to time that he had spent in <span class="INT_SPACE">confinement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Ding-Schuler took his own life when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Ding-Schuler committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">So I think that Ding-Schuler is a little different from the ilk that ran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He was able to be persuaded by Yoe- Thomas. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Now, that didn't happen very frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Because there were a lot of others that had tried substantially the same approach that were not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> we had some other interesting characters one of whom was Ilse Koch, who was the wife of a former commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">She was not the wife of a commandant that was there when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Pista (ph) was the man on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And Pista couldn't stand Ilse Koch because she still was the commandeur, according to her, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And they were somewhat at odds. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Well, Ilse Koch had a fancy for light shades. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I didn't try her for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I tried her for aiding and abetting the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">She, during the time of her husband, when he was commandant, used to report prisoners because they ogled her. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I think that's the way you pronounce it when you make big eyes at tight-fitting clothes on a very voluptuous body. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And whenever prisoners ogled Ilse, she took down their numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They were reported and they were whipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And they were whipped in a way which was absolutely inhuman. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They were spread across a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> with hands out in front of them and legs down. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And they had to count in German each blow that was administered. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And when they were directed to receive 25 blows, they had to count them out loud. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And they had to count each blow in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Well, some of those Poles couldn't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And some of the Frenchmen couldn't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And many times those beatings led to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">So she did have her share of participation in the operation of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and in furthering the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the extent that there was this common design to subject these prisoners to that type of punishment and that type of misconduct of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">All that sort of thing were things that were charged in the charge sheet. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So she was guilty of aiding and abetting the operation of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Once she had been found guilty, she was given a life sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And the only reason why I later found out from a member of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that they didn't hang her was that she was carrying a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">She was four months pregnant at the time she was sentenced. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Well, when the reviewing authority cut her sentence down from life imprisonment to four years, they gave as an excuse that there was insufficient credible evidence to justify a sentence of that severity. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Well, remember, credibility is for the fact-finder, not for the man who is reviewing the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Because the man who sees that witness testify and observes the demeanor on the stand, he knows where the truth is coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Not the man who has the written page in front of him of the record of the trial that the original <span class="BUILDING">court</span> had made. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Well, that produced a flurry when they reduced the sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I objected to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And I objected to it on the ground that I had tried four of these cases -- three at that time; that was the fourth case. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And I thought I knew how to try a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> case. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Well, when they said there was insufficient credible evidence, that they were telling me I didn't know what was credible and what wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So I wrote a letter pointing out these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And the Congress of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> took over after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">The committee in the Senate headed by Homer Ferguson held hearings from September of '48 until Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And they decided that I was right; that there was sufficient credible evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But since the reviewing authority had said no, four years 1s all, there's nothing we can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Well, the things that they did do about it, they turned them over to the German people who tried her for offenses against Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I had not tried her for offenses against Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And they tried her and she was given another life sentence and committed suicide in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was full of interesting people. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The accused I'm talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I'm sure there were a lot more interesting people who were also prisoners like Yoe-Thomas and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">One that I tried was a doctor by the name of Evan Katzenelenbogen. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">He was a doctor in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And he sold his services to the prisoners for anything that he can get out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And on occasions he would snatch prisoners out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And they lived in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> there were five men to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> that was to accommodate one and at most two. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Well, this one time he was in; and this had not happened not just one time but many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He would snatch a man off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">top bunk</span> down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , which was about six feet below. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And very frequently the prisoner would die as a result of skull fracture. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">That, plus the fact that he was selling his services to the people that he was supposed to protect and take care of, moved us to include him as one of the accused.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION: What do you mean by selling his services?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER: Excuse me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION: What do you mean by selling his services?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER: He wouldn't treat them unless they gave him part of the Red Cross packages that they had gotten a hold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">That's where he sold his services. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And to me that was a heinous offense 1n itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Well, we put him on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">He had originally been an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He married the daughter of one of the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">They had a child who fell out of a <span class="DLF">window</span> and died, and Katzenelenbogen went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Katzenelenbogen was really a psychoanalyst and a devout student of Freud. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And did his job well. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Maybe we should continue just a little bit on this a little later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">You want to stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER: Well, I mean, I thought --
QUESTION: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We can stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">TAPE #7
QUESTION: You want to continue talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katzenelenbogen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER: Katzenelenbogen was a psychoanalyst. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And he played his trade to the last inch in defense of his own self. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">That <span class="BUILDING">court</span> absolutely detested him because of the evidence that had been amassed against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And it was very little that he did to defend himself other than still claim American citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Because he had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when he was about 20 or 21 years of age, and was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And had taken citizenship papers and married a daughter of one of the justices on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">They had a child, and the child fell out of an <span class="DLF">apartment window</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And that broke up the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">He went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to -- actually it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">It was that section of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire that was in there between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Actually went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> and opened a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And the Gestapo got interested in him as an informer. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And he was an informer. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And finally he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And they put him in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I told you he was sort of a mean fella. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And he would sell his services rather than perform what he was supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And he came on for trial having committed a war crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And he more or less made an ass out of himself before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in his responses to the questions that were asked by his defense counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And his defense counsel, I believe, at that time was a man by the name of Wolff (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And Wolf did the best he could to keep Katzenelenbogen quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Because the more he talked, the worse he got. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And when I had him on cross-examination, of course I did the best I could to let him tell us everything he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And he knew a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">As a matter of fact, he said the evidence was such that he could have the then minister of justice in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> sitting in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> for the activities that that minister had performed in the small camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Well, we let him talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And after it was over, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> first called him forward and announced that he had been found guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Well, Katzenelenbogen was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And he had this deep voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">He could have been a basso profunda at the Met With no trouble at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">He said, "Now that this honorable <span class="BUILDING">court</span> has put the Mark of Cain upon my brow, I have but one wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And that is that this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> impose upon me the most serious punishment within its power." </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And he nodded like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And I thought to myself, Well, bless his heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I hope they accommodate him. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Well, there was a flurry behind on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And the president of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> said, "The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> finds pursuant to your plea of not guilty that you are guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And finding of you being guilty chooses to impose upon you a life imprisonment." </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So the old scoundrel didn't get hanged at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">He got off with his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And except for his age, he'd be alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But he played it to the last inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">That <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , I found out, that, they didn't want to please him. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And he had asked for the death sentence, and rather than please him, they gave him life imprisonment instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">So he was a doctor to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I must say that I get back to reducing sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Clemency is a proper thing to be exercised under proper conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">But there was no clemency that Ilse Koch was entitled to. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">There was no clemency that Katzenelenbogen was entitled to, in my judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But I didn't have the power to wield that authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And the fact that some of these sentences have been reduced, I go back to the feeling that I do not know all the facts and circumstances about their family relationships, whether or not they're the sole supports of families that then existed, who were probably without fault on their part. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So that there could be many considerations that could justify the reduction of sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And in the main, I find no fault with the exercise of clemency when it's denominated clemency. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">But I do object like a stuck pig to any time that they start reducing sentences on the grounds of insufficient credible evidence, for the simple reason that the whole operation was incredible in its entirety.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION: When you look at the entire set of trials that were, not just the ones you were participating in, where so many people had harsh sentences, whether it was death or life imprisonment that were severely reduced or they were let go, does that bother you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER: To let go, again, I don't know the circumstances of their letting go. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">That's a function of the exercise of clemency. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">It's to take into consideration those factors which were no part of my concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So that if I knew that a sentence had been reduced in exercise of clemency, I don't quarrel with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">If it's exercised on the ground of insufficient credible evidence, I scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And I scream loud and long, because I know that's wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And I know that's wrong because I know that these events that seem incredible to the person who reads about them happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION: Do you think there's a different political set of circumstances in 1945 versus 1948 when the trials are going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">ANSWER: I'm sure that there may very well have been, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="980"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was sickened to find denazified leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">While none of these individuals that I tried could hardly make that category, there was a Sense of uncertainty in not knowing which way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And I think this: I think the United States government did a magnificent job in its occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And I say they're entitled to all credit for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And I think while mistakes were made, to err 1s human, to forgive divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION: Tell me, were there security arrangements for you and the other lawyers during these trials that you know about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">We had guards there, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But when you talk about security arrangements, I'll assume that you're talking about somebody that's going to follow me around and be sure that somebody is not going to take a shot at me when I'm out hunting or fishing, if I did in what little spare time I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">But there wasn't anyone that tailed us to protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Nothing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">There was always a number of Polish guards that were there in that <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">You seen the white hats at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Well, the Poles wore white hats at our trial, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And they were kept on a constant surveillance by the Polish guards that we had there, as well as American guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">QUESTION: Did these trials take a physical and psychological toll on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="998">ANSWER: Oh, my goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">At one time they recessed the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> because they said I looked more like an exhibit out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> than anybody I'd put on the stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">The trousers that I wore I could fold over behind with no problem at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I was glad to lose that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">But the shirts that I was wearing at that time, somebody else could get in the neck with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And my clothes didn't fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I lost -- I got down to 117 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And I weighed normally about 155 to 165 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION: So what was your day like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And what were you working; 12, 15 hours days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER: I was working like that and sleeping less at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Because I was thinking -- I had nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">These -- I was reliving some of these experiences myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">What would I be doing under those circumstances? </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">How would I react to this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">It took a toll. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Well, after I finished <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , Flossenbiirg was the longest trial because I had been prepared in a way differently from the way I prepared cases being prepared by Colonel Shaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And at the end of January I was ready to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">This was January of '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I stayed in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And I'd get up for meals and that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And the war crimes branch representatives came down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiesbaden</span> and said they got another job that they'd like for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">They'd give me my choice: That I could either prosecute Scorzeni (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Scorzeni was a man who kidnapped Mussolini and had previously kidnapped Admiral Horthy from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And I said, "Shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We shouldn't try him; I think we ought to hire him." </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">They said, "Well, the other job is to prosecute <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And I thought, I could try that like falling off a log and nothing to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I had tried three cases, and that would be less strain on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">But that lasted from April to the end of August of '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">That's when I finished that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But that was an interesting case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">That had a lot of different things that were of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Of course it could never be interesting to the people that were prisoners in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">But it had different aspects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> they had quite a number of projects going there in the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> , at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub-camps</span> , all of which were interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And each one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub-camps</span> were operated largely like the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And some of them were much worse the Kaufering and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg camps</span> as sub-camps of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was so much worse than the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that they were not in the same <span class="BUILDING">ballpark</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Actually they had classifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Class 1 camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Class 3 camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">That was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Whenever prisoners got to the point where they couldn't work enough to earn their keep of black coffee and no cream, no sugar, no fats of any kind, and black bread down through the grams that they were being fed -- it sort of strains me to try to reconstruct these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I start thinking about what they had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Of course the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> claim that they were being fed -- the prisoners were being fed the same rations that the German populace were feeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">That was correct as to the quantity in this sense, not the quality nor by calorie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">By calorie count it was nowhere near. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">These men were working all day long, not able to sleep at night, and being fed less than a thousand calories a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Well, the same thing was happening to me to a large extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And that's why I got so gaunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">QUESTION: Were there breaks? </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">It sounds to me as if you were, for the most part, going trial to trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">ANSWER:  Well, for the most part I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I went from trial to trial because I had to prepare the next trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">After I finished -- I finished <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> the 15th of December of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I started almost immediately working on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , when I could physically work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But that took a lot out of me; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Because that was a new experience and one that I wasn't adjusted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">As I tried these cases, I got more adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And I worked on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> along with my assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And I had five very able men there to all do--Paul Gooth (ph) I kept on, and had four other lawyers there that were very able men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And I can't remember now all their names, but I don't want to mention anyone without doing an injustice to the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">QUESTION: When you got so sick and so gaunt and had all these nightmares, did you want to stop and not hear this anymore?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">ANSWER: I had to stop when we had the recess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbirg</span> , that was basically the reason why they stopped, because I couldn't go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">QUESTION: Did other lawyers respond similarly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1065">ANSWER: Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I mean, they were affected the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">But it was a nervous strain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">It was basically my responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And it was one that I didn't welcome, but it was one that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And I knew that I had to discharge it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And I had to discharge it in a way that was expected it to be discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And that's what I tried to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION: Earlier you said you wanted to talk about Kapos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">ANSWER: Oh, Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Kapos were prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And they were -- had been the main criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">They were penitentiary individuals that had served their sentences there but were still considered by the Germans to be hazard politically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So they put these poor German criminals into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and made Kapos out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Well, a lot of them -- these Kapos were also in there for rape, arson, murder, and violent crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And a lot of them had that same mentality when they were put in the position of Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And a Kapo in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was like a foreman of a work gang, with this important exception: they not only had to say what they told them to say and do what they were told to do, but if they didn't, he had the power of life and death over the people in his detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">So they did what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And for that reason, the Kapos, prisoners themselves, turned out to be meaner to the political prisoners and the others that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And particularly the Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">All the Kapos -- they put a Kapo by the name of Wolf in charge of the punishment detail in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">QUESTION: Let's hold it because I have to change the tape and we'll go back to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">TAPE #8
QUESTION: All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">You were talking about Mr. Wolf.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">ANSWER: Mr. Wolf was a criminal prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And he was given charge of what was known as the punishment detail in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> had accompanying its environment there a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And the floor of that <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> was somewhere between two and 300 feet below the level of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And this man Wolf used to take the punishment company, which was composed primarily of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Because let me say this: There's absolutely no doubt about the fact that these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps -</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> - were all used as instruments for the purpose of exterminating the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And you can tell that, because the Jews received the harshest work assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">They recetved the smallest amount of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And all the dirty, hard work that had to be accomplished was given to the Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And whenever anybody had something mean that had to be done, and I mean mean, that one prisoner fighting another, they would get one Jew and put him to do that task. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And I'll say this: That there was absolutely no doubt that any Jew that was able to survive those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> the Lord has blessed him more and more than anyone will ever know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Because they were objects of extermination of the system that they had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Well, Wolf had this punishment company which was composed primarily of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And one of the things they had to do was to carry a stone which weighed approximately 25 kilos - that's about 55 pounds - from the bottom of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> up to the top at the end of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And what else happened at end of the day, that Kapo selected one prisoner out of that group that received and had the opportunity to make the parachute jump without a parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">The other prisoners there would select the prisoner that had been picked out by Wolf, take his hands and his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">One for the money, two for the show, three to make merry, and over you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And they would throw him down and he would crash down to the bottom of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">It didn't happen every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">It didn't happen every day, because there was more pressure put on these people because they didn't know which day it was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">But no one of them knew whether or not he was going to be the next person to go one for the money, two for the show. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And they also had <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around the rim of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And they would use those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> as catapults, and put a prisoner on there, bend it down, release it then he would be tossed out down to his death in the bottom of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Well, spots -- Wolf was the commanding officer of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Now -- I mean of this detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And he made that selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Now, how many he selected there, I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Nobody will ever know because it didn't happen every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">But it happened so frequently that there was always that sense of urgency when you woke up in the morning as a member of that punishment detail as to whether or not you were going to make the parachute jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So Wolf was an individual that I think if anybody exercised clemency on his behalf they should be shot in the head and bled inthe _—_—_—ioff the foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Because he certainly wasn't entitled to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">QUESTION: Did you prosecute a number of Kapos?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">ANSWER: Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">We had the Kapos from the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">We had capos that had various work details that would -- one of them used to kill at a detail that was to take prisoners to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I mean, angels of mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And he was the Kapo in charge of this detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And he would throttle them with his bare hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So that the Kapos were hated by the prisoners who wore the red triangles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And the Kapos usually were what was known as the block eldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Prisoner who was the oldest prisoner in the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">They always got the benefit at the time that they had been in the <span class="BUILDING">penitentiary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">So they were the oldest prisoner in the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Not old in years, in age, but the oldest prisoner wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And they were hated and they hated each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">They were hate from the crown of their heads to the sole of their feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And we had the Kapo from the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">We had this Arthur Dietzsh, who was not a Kapo in the -- he was a male nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">We put that moniker on him for a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">We didn't want Dietzsh tainted with being a Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">But he was a male Kapo actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">But that was the consideration that we were terribly hopeful that the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> would give to Dietzsh; that he was not just a Kapo, but he was a man who was a real man in his heart and soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">There were few Kapos that had a heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Most of them had souls, but they were not entitled to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">QUESTION:  Well, after all of this, the trials that you were working on, did it change you in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">ANSWER: Physically, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Mentally maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Spiritually I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And if you ask me to define what happened in each one of the three I tell you I couldn't possibly do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Except the physical part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I was a physical wreck when I finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">But I got an understanding of people under peculiar circumstances and their reactions that I could never have learned about elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And hopefully I never will have to learn about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Man's inhumanity to man is something that had no bounds in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">QUESTION: Did it make you pessimistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER: To some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">To some extent, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I can look over my shoulder at things, see who's following me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">But I didn't do it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I wasn't looking over my shoulders at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">When you asked about security a moment ago, I shouldn't belittle the protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Because there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was a guard at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and there was a guard at every <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And they- that didn't stop anybody crawling over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">But we had protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And I shouldn't belittle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I'm sorry if I left that impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And I'm not going back on everything else I said, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">QUESTION: What gives you the most pride in what you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Are you proud?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">ANSWER: Well, pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Pride goeth before destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">But now that we got that out of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I took no pride in the fact that I had prosecuted 177 people in these trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And I took no pride in the fact that a lot of them were hanged and others received severe punishments of imprisonment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">The one thing that we got to remember is that these things came into being because there was a total disregard of human rights, and their protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">As has been said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> were all dungeons of democracy and so was the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">But the thing that I -- that really creates a sense of pride in my heart and feelings is when one of these true survivors of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the Holocaust comes up to me and says, We thank you for what you've done for us." </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">That I'm proud of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">QUESTION: Have you met any survivors who were connected with any one of these --
ANSWER: Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I had a friend who was a witness for me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">He's dead now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">But he was a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I hadn't seen him for years, and I ran into him in this very <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we're in now here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mineola</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And I hadn't seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And I was very fond of him and I used him extensively. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">When I say extensively, because one who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> really had a longevity of about three or four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Because the man in the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> knew a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And the Germans got rid of the people who knew a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">But Orenstein (ph) managed to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> for a long time and made an excellent witness for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I liked him very much as a man or human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And he came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> after these trials and set up a business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and was extremely successful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">He died there in last November, I think a year ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And I lost a dear friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Orenstein I'll always remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">QUESTION:  Well, Bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Thank you so much.</span></p>
