<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  The date is Sunday, March 29, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We’re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her father, Dr. Gerson Reif. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">What can you tell us about your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">What do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I don’t really know anything about his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The only things I can say about my father is that -- first of all, apparently he was a pretty good daddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Apparently he really wanted very much to have a daughter and so he was apparently very happy when I was born, as a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I think he was probably a fairly serious person but I think he was probably less way out than either of his children -- in the sense that I think he was serious about his professional pursuits but he also apparently enjoyed going to the opera and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I guess he and my mother bought sort of popular music records of the day and so I don’t think -- I have a feeling that he was not like an ultra intellectual type but very serious about his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Do you know where he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or anything about his education?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  He went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , that’s all I really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Then he actually was in the war during World War I and he was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He was in the Austrian army and he was wounded at the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Actually I’ll take you on a three -minute tour to show you a certificate that he got for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">That happened during his medical training apparently and then he went back and --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Had his parents -- you said he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> basically
ANSWER:  Yes and apparently he was the only one of the children who did anything professional.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Do you know anything about any of the other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, I know about the two who are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and my Aunt Lena came here I think in the 1920’s; got married and she and her husband owned a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The other, the Uncle Max brother owned what was called a luncheonette in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> which was a place with a <span class="DLF">fountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">You could get sandwiches or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sundae</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I think he probably was different within his own family, different from all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My brother felt that he had -- my brother liked him because he was serious and he would bring him books to read and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I think he also took my brother ice -skating, for example, which my brother apparently hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I think he had a variety of things that he liked to do and he did go dancing with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">As a matter of fact, I grew up with this funny thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I thought that all people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ever did was to go ballroom dancing in white gowns and tails for the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Actually I love to do that; my husband and I do a lot of ballroom dancing in evening gowns and tails. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I don’t know whether there’s a connection there but I think he was quite a serious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think he really liked his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I think he was a good dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I think he was serious and interested in his patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Did he always run the practice out of his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or did he ever work for someone else, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  As far as I know, he always ran the practice out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There was something else I was going to say, but it just eluded me. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">No, it wasn’t because you interrupted it’s just because I’m so forgetful. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Well, I don’t remember what I was going to say but I don’t really know very much else about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I think he was probably a gentle, kindly sort of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I think he was rather good- looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He looks good-looking when he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I have a picture of him around a cadaver on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dissecting table</span> and he was rather good-looking then. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But then later on he got kind of stocky and I don’t know, to my mind, that didn’t look too great on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of any outings or anything that you ever took with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I don’t have any particular memories of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I know that in the summers we used to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he would come on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I know my brother, to this day, still talks about those things in a somewhat mocking way, about how many suitcases and porters my mother needed to go on those trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I guess that’s really about all I can say. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I know it seems weird to me how circumstances shape people’s lives and about the fact that my father was in the Austrian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">If he had been sensible to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> earlier, that he would have been probably in the American army because you know he would have been in that age group where he still would have gotten drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">You’re sort of a pawn of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that you’re born in, in a funny kind of way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  But on the other hand, if they had remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , they probably would have been deported very early because they were Polish born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Yes, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">That’s -- I guess that’s about all I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I think he was a rather serious person although I don’t think he’s as serious a person as my brother has turned out to be, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I guess that’s about all I can say unless I think of something later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Is it all right with you if we are able to use what we have about your father to represent his story as being a victim of the Holocaust to a large extent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I think not to a large extent, I think entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  So that we represent the suicide as a direct result?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, yes, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  All right, well thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It’s been very useful and I appreciate your time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">TAPE 2
QUESTION:  Okay, this is a test. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Do you want me to do more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  The date is Sunday March 29, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We’re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">What can you tell us, let’s start with your mother, is that all right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Can you tell us her name, her date of birth, her place of birth, anything you know about her childhood, anything at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My mother’s name was Klara Gottfried Reif. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">G-o-t-t-f-r-1-e-d,. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">She was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> which is now called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">She was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She often said that she -- I guess she didn’t get along with her father as well as with her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">She liked to run around and travel and do a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She spoke several languages because when she was a child, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> kept changing and so at one point, where she was born, was part o <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I think both she and my father were actually Austrian citizens because when they were born, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , then the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think she spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a couple of other languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I never remember whether it’s five or seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Do you know what they spoke at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  I think at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Yeah, I think that was correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My mother did a lot of traveling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> to have clothes made and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I think she went off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at some point also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Do you know what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Was it a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">No, it was definitely not a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> and I don’t really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I have a feeling it might have been more like a <span class="BUILDING">finishing school</span> or just some kind of general school. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">She definitely finished <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> but did not go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> but she was pretty clever. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She was very, very good with numbers and she did a lot of reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was young in fashion and that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">At some point she went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> either for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Somehow and I don’t know how, but she met my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Ultimately they got engaged and then they got married, I think in 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  They got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  They got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , well, I’m not sure about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I’m not sure about that, they might have gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But anyway, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> after they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Then in 1927, my brother was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Now my mother tells me about her life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">She said in the beginning it was kind of hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and retrained as a dentist and he opened his <span class="BUILDING">practice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Now one of the things my mother always told me is that we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Este</span> , that’s the first district in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Excuse me, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Este</span> is where she would have liked to live She said that the reason they lived there was because my father’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that’s where he saw patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was for reasons of the business that we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We lived actually, I guess, right overlooking the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So in the early years, she said things were difficult and she helped my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She would do things like answer the phone and maybe help prep patients and various other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I guess my father did pretty well fairly quickly and so things kind of perked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I think things were quite comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We had -- I know there were about six people who used to come and go in terms of “servants.” </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There was a cook who did our meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My brother and I each had a governess when we were kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Each? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">A Yeah, we are very far apart so it wasn’t concurrent. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There were one or two women who came in to do laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You know in those days everything was a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I mean coming in to do the laundry was taking the sheets and boiling them up with soap and Clorox and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was kind of a big thing and then even --. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We did actually have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacuum cleaner</span> and I personally remember that these two cleaning women used to come and they would roll up the rugs and take them up to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> with these bamboo, oddly shaped paddles and beat the hell out of the rugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There were these servants around and at that point I think my mother sort of became a lady of leisure. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Again I don’t know which of these stories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the servants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I think she went and I think they did a fair amount of socializing. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I think they went to the opera and they would go dancing and go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I know they went -- apparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually -- the daughter lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They must have done a lot of things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a more -- I don’t know, a more frivolous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Actually my brother apparently didn’t do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he really liked my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he was very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Then --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Can we back up just a little? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">A Yeah go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Do you know about her life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before she moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Do you know about, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Were they religious, were they orthodox?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  I think her parents were orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I don’t know that my mother really -- I mean my mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I’m not sure she really believed in any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I don’t know, she certainly had some sorts of superstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she probably went along with the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I don’t think she and my father had -- we didn’t have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span> and we --. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I think they did go to services on the high holidays and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I’d be curious to know whether we -- I’m sure we ate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I don’t know what the answer is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Was it ham on matzo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Well, I’m sure we ate ham. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I’m absolutely sure we ate ham. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We probably didn’t eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don’t think it was terribly compulsive. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I think it was fairly casual. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I have a feeling that her father was probably not very casual and I don’t know about her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I have a feeling that the mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort of retiring religious kind of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I think that my mother always felt that she was considered the black sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Not by her mother, but by her father, that her father didn’t like her as well as he liked the other two kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I think she thought that was because she was sort of rebellious and didn’t do the things that the other kids did. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Definitely, my mother’s brother and sister sound like more traditional kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Here was this young chick going off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and marrying strange people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very dramatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and whose son is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and is a physician, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Of course, I lost contact after my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I think the letter was from this guy Moshe Weinhaub. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Well, they all perished in one form or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Now my mother’s sister, that was the most dramatic thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her kids into an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and then they shot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That was really a horror story. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I think my mother’s brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a lot of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They purposely tried to contract typhoid and they did so they died of the typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They purposely did that because they didn’t want to die in what they knew was awaiting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">There were just descriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I don’t know whatever happened to that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">As a matter of fact, 1t’s really weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">This is my mother’s -- those two pieces of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> are my mother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Since my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I have not been able to find the key to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Every once in a while, I try to get it open because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have mixed feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Part of me wants to know what’s behind those little <span class="DLF">doors</span> and part of me probably doesn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a very, very different person after the war from what she was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Although I can’t really judge that, that’s kind of a guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  I made you jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Now why don’t we come back to the time that she had given birth to your brother, I guess?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Right, 1927, April 24, 1927. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">My brother was apparently a very serious little boy even at age two. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">My mother always told stories about how when she would go for a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want to have her read the street signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">What does that say, how do you spell that, what are the letters? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That’s her perception. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">My brother -- I have a picture of my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a <span class="DLF">sandbox</span> with his rear end up -- sort of off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> so he wouldn’t get himself dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">My brother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn’t allowed to be a little boy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn’t get dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I think there were a lot of interesting dynamics there. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Then at age three, they started him on violin lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Somehow it didn’t work out so they stopped at the advice of the teacher, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Then he started again at the age five. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Then it really took hold very well and he really did play the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">If you ask him, he’Il say, well you know, I’m not -- I can’t really play very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But he really plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I mean for an amateur, he plays extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Then when my father died -- well first my father got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking very bad in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I really should back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Starting in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I think things started being politically very hairy. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">People had just come out of a Depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">As an aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an accident because I’m seven and a half years younger than my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Subliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody which in retrospect seems silly. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But actually I was over forty once when I asked my brother, was I an accident? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">My brother said, no, absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Why did they wait so long? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Because of the Depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I was born in 1934, in November and so things were --. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a kid because things were not looking good. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Did I send you the article I wrote for Boston Magazine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  You sent me one about your cousin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  I didn’t send you one from Boston Magazine? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I should give that to you because that’s sort of about this subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Anyway, so then I was born, and then things started getting bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They got worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">My father and mother started talking about the possibility of going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Apparently my father just felt - in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So his feeling was, how can I go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I don’t know the language; I would have to retrain. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We would get there and we would have nothing so it just didn’t seem like a reasonable thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like everybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">My father got really, really, very, very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">My brother, I think my brother really still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my mother not handling that right. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I’ve asked him about that and he says well, she used to say well you know you got to come out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You can’t walk around like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I said to my brother, well what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He said, well I remember standing in a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> holding his hand, just quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Now that I’m at my present age and our kids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really don’t know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it’s kind of a survival thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">That you’ve got to just keep doing what are your daily things because otherwise you’re going to go insane also. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I don’t know what was going on there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were happening to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I’m sure that my father must have been extremely frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">There’s a woman who actually went to medical and then <span class="BUILDING">dental school</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We were always friendly with that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">For example, that woman was forced to go out and scrub the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">All sorts of demeaning things happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time psychologically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Until the time that he was forced to stop working, he worked regularly? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">A Yes, I think he did work regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Even if maybe he was beginning to be depressed or whatever? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">He didn’t --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I think he got very depressed after he had to close his practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Now I don’t know that for sure, I just know that from things that I’ve gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Somewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So they went and applied for visas and passports and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">On the morning of September 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> together to go pick up those passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They picked up the passports and at about noontime, they parted to do separate chores. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They were supposed to meet, I think, at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of this cousin where they used to play cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Apparently my father never got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody telling me, there was a phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">My father had been found at the bottom of a <span class="DLF">staircase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I’m not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or right after he got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But the death certificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of fractured ribs. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> of this -- down the <span class="DLF">stairwell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">There was a lot of trauma around that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">You know, it’s funny, children don’t ask the right questions all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">When I was discussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I’ve never kept this a secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Then a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking, well, now how do we know he committed suicide? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">People say you’re just trying to protect yourself from this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">First of all, I don’t have anything against this, I just don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It wouldn’t -- in general it wouldn’t bother me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I keep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I suppose in one way it doesn’t bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a shirking of your responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">You know you had two kids and this was not the appropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">My brother’s idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the reasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people were committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a woman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there was no husband around. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">At that time, mostly it was the men who were being really harassed, initially. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I don’t know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I think, well there was nobody there to see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">All sorts of horrible things were happening to Jews, how do we know what really happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Could he have been pushed? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The other thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession who has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself off a <span class="DLF">stairwell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">That’s another reason why I think that maybe he didn’t do it himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they’re not necessarily being totally rational.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Right, the way some people plan it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">This sounds like it perhaps hadn’t been contemplated f or long, this specific act if 1t was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  I don’t know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was also a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide apparently also jumped off something or other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  Yes, he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  But anyway, the answer is I don’t know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">When this happened, my mother was just totally devastated, just --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Before we -- I hate to break your train of thought?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  No, go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I don’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about her personality before this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="302">When you were very, very young?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember very much about her except --. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I remember a few silly things like I used to like to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and dry the dishes for the cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The cook would stand me up on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> and hand me one dish at a time and I would dry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I also liked to iron. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You know in those days there was no electric iron so they had those irons that you kind of had to keep putting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> until they get hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I used to like to iron and my mother really didn’t like me to do those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I loved to do those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Maybe she was already overly protective before the war, I’m not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Do you still like to 1ron?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  No, I don’t like to iron. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I don’t mind but I don’t like to iron and I hate to dry dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">As a matter of fact, I think my mother used to kid me about because then -. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and she wanted to help with those things she would tease me and say you used to love to do it when I didn’t want you to. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Now when I want you to, you don’t want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Well, it seems to me that it’s fairly self evident that it would be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Do I remember anything else about her? </span><span class="sentence" id="319">You know, I actually remember more about my interactions with the governess and the servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">For example, the things I remember about the servants is that they were fun for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The reasons they were fun was that they would come in and do all these routine things. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Like we had a very long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> because the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was two 7- room apartments with the <span class="DLF">wall</span> broken down between them so there were 14 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They all went off this long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We had this rug, runner-rug, so they would roll that up every time they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don’t know whether it was every day or every other day or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They would let me sit on the end of the runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Then they would start rolling it, pull, roll, pull, so I’d get aride. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Or if they were sweeping the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , they’d let me put my feet on the broom and sweep with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Or swing me back and forth and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Those were kind of exciting things for me and I think my governess had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I remember her being there; I remember it was kind of a probably consoling feeling that -- I don’t know whether she was there all the time or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I don’t ever remember the kind of thing of being left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But then early on, I think I did get left alone at night to sleep because my brother tells me I was an absolute royal pain, that I used to scream through the nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The governess would not let my mother come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I don’t really remember a lot about my mother in those days and I certainly do not remember my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The funny thing is I remember my father but then one day, when I must have been about ten or something, looking at this picture of my father that my mother always had on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night table</span> and suddenly realizing that the real memory of my father had been taken over by the memory of the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I no longer had that real memory that I had originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I remember my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I think I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and I certainly remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  Well the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , I seem to remember, it was kind of very formal and dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It seemed dark in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don’t know whether because there were curtains drawn or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We did have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> that was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It was a dark, probably mahogany or something, massive. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was the sort of massive thing that was popular in the 1930’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I just remember the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the middle and looking in there and it was -- just remember a sort of formal feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was sort of light and airy; there was this white --. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> there were no built in <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> and so people had -- they were called wardrobes. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> there was a white lacquered big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> with two <span class="DLF">doors</span> that opened with keys, these kinds if old fashioned keys. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I think the cook had like dish towels in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">One memory that became very important for Kristallnacht -- she had -- and actually I have one upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There were these little things you could buy, pasteels they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They were sort of awful tasting things, minty or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They came in either single boxes or triple boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I don’t know if they were double sized ones but they were sort of green and gold cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The cook had a triple sized one of those in that white <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Whenever she had extra goshen which are the equivalent of pennies she would put them into that can. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There must have been some connection to me about that can. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I don’t know what it could have been, maybe she bought me things with those occasionally or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But anyway, there was this long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and I remember my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> quite well.. My <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had a nice <span class="DLF">window</span> which I think overlooked the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Then there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span> over there with a stuffed animal on it and then my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> which was not like an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American crib</span> but had -- the part that goes up and down had a mesh of sort of ropes going both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">That was the way <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cribs</span> were made in that time, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Then there was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> that the governess used to maybe nap on or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I don’t think it was a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but I sort of liked that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Then I remember my father’s <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , my father’s <span class="INT_SPACE">examining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I remember the linoleum on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and that becomes important for later when we back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in 1963 and I recognized that. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But anyway so then the next -- my big memory is the night of Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">My mother was holding me up in her arms and my brother was holding -- of course my father was dead by now -- my brother was holding on to my mother’s skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">There was this loud knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and my mother said who’s there and the superintendent was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Now I only remember the superintendent and one other man. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But my brother says there were actually five or six men who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">My mother went to open the little metal thing on the glass peephole and this guy smashed the glass with the back of a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The superintendent said, let us in Mrs. Reif, we won’t hurt you. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They came in and I remember being in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The only really strong memory I have is of them taking that can full of coins. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They took, they helped themselves to everything, all the radios, anything that was of any value, they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Although before that, interestingly, apparently either my mother or some relative -- my father as a dentist had hunks of gold because in those days a lot of fillings were made with gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Somebody went and dumped those in the bottom of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Whatever else was valuable in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , these people helped themselves to. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I do think I remember one of the guys having a radio or something in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But the thing that I, as a little girl, felt most resentful about was that they took away this box of coins. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They left and then I don’t remember anything else about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I think I may remember the little suit that I wore when we got on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luee</span> but I’m not sure whether I remember that or I remember a picture that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I actually have that outfit still. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I remember one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">After Kristallnacht, somehow, I don’t know how it happened, but my mother managed to get these tickets to get on the San Luee. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The reason we got first class passage was because you were only allowed to take, I think it was like four dollars a person, out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .My mother figured, what the hell, we might as well go first class. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We had to pack up stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">You were allowed to send things away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Send abroad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  Yes, but there regulations and I have a feeling that some things got smuggled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">For example, a bunch of sterling silver flatware was in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and I think that was strictly forbidden if I have read my history correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But anyway my mother was not very -- my mother was really devastated -- I was going to say she wasn’t very functional but she obviously managed all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I think other people came and kind of had to help her do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">There was a -- my brother had met another boy called Irwin Kleinfeld who’s now a mathematician at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Iowa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lowa City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Through that friendship, our parents kind of got to know his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The father was a lawyer and somehow he came and helped my mother out with various things. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The day this enormous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , he was there helping my mother get stuff packed into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I think my mother was not doing very well and he kind of said, take this, take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I don’t know who made the final decisions, I have a feeling that he made a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">There were some really weird things in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> , just really weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">For example, we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> that was totally covered apparently in mirrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It was made out of these tiles that were about eight inches wide by about fourteen inches high. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">One of the things that came out of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> , when we got it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> three years later, was all these mirrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Now what did anybody think we were going to do with these mirrors! </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So that was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Weird things, on my second birthday, I had been bought a very special doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">That doll arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , speaking of traumatizing kids, it was hung by the neck from the bar inside one of the wardrobes with all the clothes and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">This guy, I remember that day, I remember this guy coming and I remember these things going out into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and it sat in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> which I think was paid for by my aunt Lena or maybe we sent -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Then I don’t remember that trip except for being seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Then we were sent back to Europe and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">That’s where my memories start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The first thing that happened was -- am I on track? -- </span><span class="sentence" id="415">1s this the kind of stuff you want to hear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Yeah, since I already have a lot of this, of the facts, do you know any of your mother’s responses to these things? </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Or her feelings -- how did she respond being in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> when you --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  The thing that I remember is that my mother -- my remembrance of my mother was that she was, to a large extent for years and years, in a state of -- I don’t know what to call it -- in a state of somebody who’s just been through a catastrophe which she had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It’s just that most people seem to recover more rapidly and she just did not recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">She recovered effectively in that she always seemed to do the right thing to get to the next step but emotionally she never recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So my recollection of my mother through most of these years is that she was often a very sad person, it was like a lot of sighing and just this unhappy demeanor on her face, for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">She also, in later years, some of that lifted and she could be a real fun person sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">It was almost weird and I couldn’t even begin to go through this until very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But now I have a feeling that if somebody had somehow just let her or encouraged her, she could have been a really vibrant dazzling lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Occasionally she would dance with me, not very often but occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">She was very good in later years like after I met Sam and we got married and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She was always game for anything, fly on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet</span> ; yeah, PI fly on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">She didn’t have any of these hang-ups like other parents of my contemporaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You know, they wouldn’t ride an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">She came, even when she was sixty, she climbed with us in Yosemite but there was always this real sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I remember once when she was already starting to get Alzheimer’s disease, she said this to me very often but this particular time I remember it very dramatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">She said, I’ve only had thirteen good years in my whole life and those were the first thirteen years with my father is what she was referring to. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We were not very nice children to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We were extremely hard on her for many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">First of all, my brother thought she was frivolous, I probably thought she was a little frivolous also although she was very sad and serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">She always seemed to be concerned about things that -- I don’t know how we got to be so lofty thinking but she always seemed to be concerned with things that we felt were not terribly important. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">One would say that there was friction because we just totally lorded it over her. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It was really, as I think back on it now, was a very strange situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Let me flip it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">END OF SIDE A, TAPE 2
ANSWER:  Is it going now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Now we’re on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">She was very, very encouraging of our studying and doing well for ourselves but she didn’t demand enough for herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I can say this in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">For example, my brother had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to himself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- I’m skipping ahead now but -- and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with her and I did my homework in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tired from work, she would make dinner, she would clean up and then I had the audacity to tell her that she couldn’t run the water to wash the dishes while I was doing my homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She went along with that! </span><span class="sentence" id="449">That was really -- in retrospect that was sort of amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She should have told me where to get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">She did get after me to help often and I sometimes tried to help a little but I -- it’s funny you know now, do you have children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  No, not yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  You see this thing reflected in your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I mean she would say, would you dry the dishes? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I would say yes Ill dry the dishes as soon as I finish my homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Then she would say -- she couldn’t wait till I finished because she was very methodical about all the household things. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So she would dry the dishes, so most of the time I never got to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I would have done it if she had waited but she couldn’t wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Now as a parent I can sense that irritation of I want it done now and the kid wants to do it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It’s just that I sort of know enough to know that if I really don’t want to do it and I want the kid to do it, you just leave it and let the kid do it later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  Did she have any interests? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">You said she enjoyed dancing and things like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">You mentioned that there was opera -- did she follow anything closely? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Have hobbies or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">She actually, she was fantastic with her hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">In Europe when she was a lady of leisure she did embroidery, that’s what ladies did. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">She did that whole thing, that’s all silk petite point. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It took her two years to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We were such terrible kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We both used to tease her about why did you spend all this time doing this really disgusting-looking scene? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Why didn’t you at least pick some --? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">First of all, now it’s still looks like --. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I still think why did she spend all this time doing this scene but it doesn’t look as bad as it used to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Now I really appreciate the time and the energy and the devotion and the workmanship. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">There are lots of things around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Later on it became things that we tried to get her to do to keep her busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">She didn’t know, I don’t know how she did this in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> she probably picked this up whenever she had time and then put it down and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">In the time that I really knew her, she didn’t know how to relax except to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">She did a lot of reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I’m not always sure that -- she read in a funny way. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">She did not read like an educated person. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">She read in a way that was non-analytical. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We, the children, who both turned out to be Ph.D. scientists found this really weird.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  How do you mean non-analytical? </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Reading fiction in a non-analytical way? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I have to defend the humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Well the best way and this may even be an unfair way to say but one of the things that I remember and this had nothing to do with reading but rather with a movie, she was here baby sitting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">She had seen a movie called ‘I Never Sang For My Father’. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">My husband and I were going out to see it that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">When we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , almost simultaneously my husband and I said boy, what a miserable father. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">At the same moment she said, wasn’t that a miserable son? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I’m sure it could be interpreted both ways but I think any -- if you looked at the critics which I don’t think I ever did of that movie -- I think the whole point of that movie is that here is a parent who is manipulating the son in such a way that the son’s life becomes ruined. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">My mother totally missed that, all she could see was the bad son, not being nice to the daddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  I see what you mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  Or for example, after our kids were born, I would keep giving her books to read about child rearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Every time she finished one, she’d say, ah, this is really interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">This is great. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I wish I had known about this when you were small. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But then ten minutes later she would go and totally interact by her gut reaction rather than by what she had just read about. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We would get into some really ridiculous arguments, she and I. Later on, after I got my Ph.D. and got a job, because she worked like a mad dog in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> -- she had incredible pride in her work. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">She not only did what she had to do but she worked harder because she wanted everything to be just right. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We pretty much had to insist that she retire and my brother and I each gave her money. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Well, she never could feel comfortable with getting money from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We would say look, you struggled like mad to support us. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Did we ever complain about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">No, we just took the money and we lived happily ever after. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Now it’s your turn to have a good time and retire. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We are doing quite well, we are in no way being hurt by giving you this money. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Why don’t you just take the money and enjoy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">You’ve had a really hard life, now’s the time to have a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">She could never cope with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Every month when the checks came, there was a struggle about whether she was going to keep these checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But then also when she did retire, she was lonesome, what was she going to do with her time? </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Sam and I used to devise these projects for her to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">One time she said she really needed a bookcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We bought her an unfinished bookcase and some varnish and shellac and the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We said well this ought to keep her busy for a week or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We told her how to do this and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Two days later or three days later, she calls up, I finished the bookcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">What do you mean, you finished the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">You have to wait at least so many hours in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">She said, oh I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It said wait five hours so I set the alarm clock when I went to sleep and at five hours I got up and I put on the next coat and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Everything was like something she had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">All right, I’ll give her something better to do so I gave her this enormous piece of rug mesh, to hook a rug which is now hanging on our <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I thought well this has got to keep her busy for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">After a few weeks, she came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It was all finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">She said, you know this was really very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">My hands were bleeding along the sides from working on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Everything we tried to do to occupy her time in a nice way- but on the other hand she also did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">She must have gone to every free concert in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and free plays and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">She would start talking to younger people, other people found her very delightful because they didn’t have to grow up with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So none of those irritations were there but it was very hard for her to make friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The only people that she made friends with were other ladies like her from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was hard to find those as the years went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Even with those people, she was very critical and so if they did something wrong, she would get very annoyed or insulted or --. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">You were going to ask something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  Did she speak German with you and your brother or with these other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Did she prefer to speak German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  She did speak German with them, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">She did speak German with us for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I think in the later years, after our kids were born, she probably spoke more English. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">When we first came here, she had all these books and every night she’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work, she’d be exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">She would make dinner, she would clean up, she would get into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , she would study her English. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">She was very thorough; she had these little notebooks about this size that she would keep. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Every night she would write down everything she spent that day in that notebook. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">She would add it up and then she would count what was in her change purse and her wallet. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">If it was off by even one cent, even if 1t was late at night, she would go through the whole thing as many times as it took, to balance that perfectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It could not be off by one penny. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Then funny things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">One time I remember -- you know how you get into silly discussions about -- she had bought me this dress and I said it cost so much and she said no, 1t was so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">She just went and got her little thing of little books and looked it up and there it was with the date and how much it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Gray dress with white stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">She was really, she was almost compulsive about keeping the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Every Saturday was cleaning day. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Come <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , <span class="NPIP">hell</span> or high water, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> got cleaned on Saturday from top to bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I got involved in that and sometimes I felt resentful about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was a gorgeous Saturday and from nine in the morning until three in the afternoon, we cleaned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- washed the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , my mother was not doing very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">With all the languages she could speak, she never learned to speak French because she was just so emotionally devastated and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , when we first got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludern</span> we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">There were a whole bunch of about twenty refugees who were put up at this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">She was really -- in addition to things being bad, she was upset about all sorts of minor things. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Like in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , there were cats and the cats were allowed to walk on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">food table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Well, I get bothered about that also but under those circumstances --. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">She went to ask the woman who ran the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where is there a <span class="INT_SPACE">public bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> but no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The woman didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">This blew my mother’s mind, how could she not know! </span><span class="sentence" id="574">This woman, like a lot of other French women, would put on a lot of perfume. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">My mother was always -- g-d, she must be filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I’m sure she spongedbathed and so on but anyway -- so my mother was really bothered by things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I remember that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Then after we had been there -- I had a little boyfriend whose name was Jacques Paul Berg and I just --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  He was in the picture you sent me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  Right, and he apparently perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I don’t know what that meant having a little boyfriend but I think he was just my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Then the other thing I remember from that time, this was really weird stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I remember there were these two girls who forced me to watch the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> cooks kill a chicken in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I just cried and cried, I was really upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Just around the time of the San Luee reunion in 1989, I coincidentally met these two women who were the two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They said well there weren’t any other children so it must have been us. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Yes, it sounds like the kind of thing we would have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They actually, those people if you could get to interview them, it would be very interesting, because those two sisters have diametrically opposite stories about what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Not the facts, but the attitudes are just diametrically opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Do you remember their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">First of all their unmarried last name was Isner. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I-s-n-e-r. The younger one is Ruth Isner Kissinger and her husband is actually a first cousin of Henry Kissinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The other is Bella and she remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I don’t remember what happened to her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She’s now Bella Isner Uhlfelder U-h-I-f-e-l-d-e-r. Ruth Isner is, I found her very easy to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Actually Bella was originally easier to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Ruth is a more reticent person but Ruth has been much more cooperative with me about collecting stuff for my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Bella got mad at me for some really dodo thing at the reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Because I got up and announced that I was doing this book and she accused me of making this very emotional thing into a commercial affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I don’t know but anyway I have not gotten a story from Bella but I have one from Ruth Isner. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I think it will be very interesting to interview both of these sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Where do they live, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Yeah, they both live in --. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">No, she lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , Bella lives in, I think, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> or uptown <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> but somewhere in the 100’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Anyway, so we spend almost a year there, just short of a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Then one morning the Germans came in and took the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I remember that because we woke up and they were parading around. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Shooting into the <span class="DLF">air</span> and just being generally very noisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The thing that I remember was I was a very goody-goody little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I’d always been taught, you don’t lie, you don’t this, you don’t that. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I was told that no way was I allowed to let on that I could speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">The generals, I guess, actually came and lived in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> so for about two weeks, we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I remember being totally -- I thought that this was really weird -- that you’re not supposed to lie but here I am and I can understand everything all these guys say. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Every time they talk to me I’m standing there saying . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">My brother now tells me that one day my brother just had his heart in his mouth because one of these guys came up to me, started to talk to me and my brother saw me start to answer in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He became petrified and he said at the last minute, I suddenly must have remembered, and I said . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But that was a very important time in my life because there was a young German soldier there. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I don’t really remember his face except it was a very nice face. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He had sandy colored hair; I don’t know if I could have judged but as I think back he must have been 18 or 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There was something very pleasing about this kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Every morning they did these stupid maneuvers around this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we would watch from our <span class="DLF">window</span> which looked out over the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">This guy would throw me candies and things; my mother was always sure they were poisoned and didn’t want me to eat them but you know I didn’t get stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So I ate it and here Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Then he ultimately gave me a little doll which I treasured for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Now I don’t know whether this is true or not but in my mind, that soldier was unbelievably important. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Because when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , the kids -- well first of all kids are brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The kids were really brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">First of all everybody was making fun of me because I couldn’t speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Even some of the parents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> were not really very kindly which I find kind of shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The kids would come over t me and even the adults and say, do you hate the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Even as a kid, I was seven, I would say no, I don’t hate the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">There are good Germans and there are bad Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The reason I was able to say that must have had to do -- probably also had to do with discussions with my brother -- but I think it had a lot to do with this soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It really wasn’t until very recently that I started thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Well was this soldier -- well I always somehow, in my life, assumed that that soldier knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But recently I thought,, well, did he know? </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Maybe he didn’t know, maybe he was just being nice to me because he thought I was a cute little Catholic kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But the point 1s, it’s irrelevant it’s what that guy represented to me, throughout my life whether it was real or not real. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">That I think was incredibly important about that particular stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Then there was a lot of talk between my mother and my brother about what’s to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You can’t stay here because I don’t know how my mother managed to -- I mean my mother couldn’t even talk one word in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">How could she carry this ruse on for two weeks of us making believe that we couldn’t speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I don’t know how we managed to get through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Apparently, according to my mother, my mother says that my brother said to her one day, I’m leaving here whether you leave or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Now my brother doesn’t quite remember saying anything quite so dramatic but in the meantime apparently my brother tells me that there are meetings amongst these twenty refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">As a group, they decided to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Now there was only one family, I heard about this for years, there was one family who decided not to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I never knew who that was until 1989; it was this family, these sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">That was obviously the wrong move because they didn’t get out until °46 or ’47. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">We left all our stuff in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> except for a couple of pairs of underwear and my brother’s violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We went very late at night, I remember walking to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was dark and I think it was midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and I didn’t remember that there were 20 of us or 18 of us or whatever it was; I only remember my mother and my brother and me walking to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">My brother has filled me in on the funny things that happened along the way and how we actually got across the <span class="DLF">border</span> by- it was just luck and a ruse. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">The next thing I remember 1s being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> which is famous for it’s china. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I think that first night we actually must have slept in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and I slept on a scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">There was a scale in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Then we got put up and I thought it was just for one night but my brother says we were there for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">You can see that my memory 1s distorted compared to his. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But we got put up in the concrete bleachers of a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> for the circus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  Yeah, you told me this, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  Then ultimately some people got together and rented these two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">The <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were each maybe about two or three times as big as this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">There were 30 women in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> downstairs and I think I was the only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">We live in there for several months and all the guys lived upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I think my brother was the only child upstairs, the only one of the men who was a boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  What did your mother do there, when you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  Nobody could do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  You just hung around --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  I seem to remember them being pretty busy cleaning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They were always cleaning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">In the nighttime we had these straw sacks that we put down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we slept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">In the morning, we piled them up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and there were these crates, like orange crates and we’d put those down as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">People were always sweeping and cleaning and walking down, every morning we walked down --. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I was allowed to get about three inches worth of milk in a coke-sized bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">My mother made me share that with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">You had to walk to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and they measured this out, walk back. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There were always walks begging for bread in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">That was my job, I think I told you about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Right, it was cute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Just last year, when I was interviewing my brother, I said to him, did anybody think how demeaning this was to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">My brother looked at me and he said it wasn’t demeaning, it was bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I have a sign in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that says that because it reminds me of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Anyway that’s where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I think it was a very lonesome time for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">There weren’t, somehow, I don’t think I played with the other kids after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They lived some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else, we were refugees which was probably not a nice thing to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  Do you know about your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Did she interact with the other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Well she interacted with the other women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  You know how you said, she basically began to change or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Do you think she was in this --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  She definitely interacted with the other women but I have a feeling that she may not have been terribly popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">She was emotionally a downer a lot of the time, she was always sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">A lot of other people -- I think that’s true of my brother also. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">When we got on the San Luee, apparently mot people -- when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> sailed away, and the captain said all right, these people are going to be treated like all people who are on a tour, people were rejoicing and dancing and doing all these other things which my mother was not participating in. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Which my brother, even though he was about 11 or 12 at the time, said he was really bothered that these people were being so insensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">That they had left people behind in dire straits, that they had just come from being in dire straits and it was not a time to dance or sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Well my adult me can see it both ways; yeah, it’s not a time to dance and sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">On the other hand, I can see where, if you’ve been really hurting for so long, and there’s an opportunity to do something different, then maybe it makes good mental health sense to try to take advantage of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I think we spent our time on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> rather quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I must have played with the other kids and there’s a picture that I sent you a copy of and there seemed to be quite a lot of kids though most of them, I think, were older and there were a few babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I have a feeling that I was kind of lonesome but there was some -- I remember some really nice things. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Like there was a carpenter who couldn’t work most of the time and he made me this wonderful little set of red and blue <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and he made upholstery things with little pieces of wallpaper and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">That was a really nice thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Then after a few months, two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> next door to the two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> we had, became available. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I don’t know why but somehow my mother was chosen or somehow got to have the smaller of the two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">We didn’t have to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , we could put our -- they were like orange <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crate beds</span> that somebody had put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We could put our straw bags on those. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">That’s where I had real measles in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember that very dramatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I remember for two weeks lying on my back in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a dark curtain drawn because I was do photophobic and watching the mold grow on the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and the drips come and drip down. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">For two weeks I was lying there like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">The two couples who got the <span class="INT_SPACE">outer room</span> , were two sisters married to two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">One of those brothers was almost blind and he somehow, even though I think this was illegal, he managed to find some leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">He would punch out those pieces of leather that you make the belts that hook onto each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">My brother and I would sometimes help him and I liked doing that especially because I think he used to tell us stories while we sat and work. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We would sit at this little <span class="DLF">window</span> and we would make these belts. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">That was kind of a pleasant thing for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you can think of about your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Because I know, basically when we write this ID, we will stop when you get o <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because that’s the Holocaust --. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Is there anything else you can think of to fill in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  I think my mother was extremely somber in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I remember going for some long walks to try to get food and I remember those as being somber occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I may be totally wrong but I don’t remember any laughter or --. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The only way I can present her personality really is to tell you about after we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because I think it must have been worse in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">My mother imagined herself a really aristocratic lady -- that’s the way she thought of herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">When my aunt Lena and -- actually it was her kids who came with her -- brought us from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> --. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">She lived in the lower East Side and I was sitting next to my mother in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seat</span> and my brother was sitting next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">As we drove into the lower East Side with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">push- carts</span> and this sort of mass of humanity, my mother whispered, for this I’ve struggled all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I thought oh my G- d, what a terrible thing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Even though maybe I was also feeling part of that, maybe I was worried that someone was going to hear or what but she just --. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">We lived with my aunt for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">My aunt got sick at one point and in retrospect we should have been really grateful for being put up. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I think my mother really was very grateful but at the same time, when my aunt got sick and needed somebody to make her a cup of tea, my mother had no idea how to make a cup of tea because she’d been so --. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Part of that had to be a put-up job because in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in those two years, everybody was struggling making meals and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I think it was more maybe when she was asked to make cereal or something, she had never done that, she hadn’t a clue and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But she was a very giving person and so when we finally got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> after three months and I think she was earning $35 or $45 a month, something like that -- no wait a minute -- what was she earning? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">She was earning $15 a week, that’s what it was and the rent was $45 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">She would buy things for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Sometimes she’d even come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a little treat for us and she was living on toast and tomatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">It was all for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">She wore black for years and years and years; it wasn’t until -- I don’t know when it happened that she would occasionally put on something red; but for years --. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Then there was that whole struggle of when I tried to put on something black. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">She would say there will be time enough for that, don’t wear -- if you have to wear black, put on a flower or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">She often complained about her state in life and I don’t blame her but she didn’t have any guidance. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She could have had a fantastically better life, she could have been a fantastic bookkeeper but nobody guided her so she ended up leading her life in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> which she hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">It wasn’t so much the work as it was the demeaning atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">She felt that she was with these uneducated, boorish people who -- I think occasionally even people made passes at her which she found --. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">She was so Victorian that even when she was in the <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> -- no it wasn’t the <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It was when she was living in a senior citizens’ thing, when we moved her up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span> and she belonged to some golden age club. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I think she was 80 by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">One day she called me up and it was raining and she said, some 80 -year- old man offered her a ride back to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I said good, did you take 1t? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Who do you think I am? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Would I take a ride with a strange man? </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So she had this image of herself, she never would have thought of getting remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">She wouldn’t, the idea of, no man was allowed to touch her except my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">She had a terrible time getting used to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because one time she came in for a job interview or something and the boss was sitting on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> with his feet up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Well, she thought that that was treating her in a terrible way or for example, when people would call her by her first name without being invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> she was Frau Doctor Reif and the least she expected was to be Mrs. Reif. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">She had a lot of those -- she was just very European. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But she also -- she adapted very well in other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">She got to be really good at shopping and knowing where to get bargains. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">She was very, she was always very energetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It’s just that she didn’t always channel her energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Like when she went to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the morning, she would get up I think at six in the morning in order to be able to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at a quarter to eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">During that time, she must have expended, I mean you could have built a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the amount of energy she expended just in the process of getting herself dressed, makeup and a hat and hat pins, stockings and shoes and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Then she’d get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and take it all off and put on some work clothes that she had at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Then she’d put it all back on to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">What else do you want to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  I think that’s painting a very nice picture and I think we definitely know -- because we have the story line.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Let me add one more thing because I don’t want to leave you with the wrong impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">She also, she was very good- natured like she’d play cards with me, if I was bored, she’d play cards with me.- Or if I needed to memorize a poem for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , even though she was exhausted, she would sit up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at night and have me recite over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Was that IF by Roger Kipling, I just remember that one in particular, but many things like that; she was really very good about always trying to do things to try to make me happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I think there was a really fun loving person there that never got to come out because of the way life went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Well, thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">This is the end. </span>
