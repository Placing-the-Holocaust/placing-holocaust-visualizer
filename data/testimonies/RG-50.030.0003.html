<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, we are on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Would you tell me your full name, including your maiden name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My full name now is Agnes Adachi, and my maiden name was Agnes Mandl, M- A-N-D-L.
QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , in 1918, October 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Tell me — would you tell me about your parents and your family when you were a child before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Well, I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I was born into a very rich family right then and up ‘til my six years, we were quite well to do and I went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> started out. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And then my father lost every penny he ever had through the crash in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And instead of coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> anyhow, he took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> where I lived for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And that was great experience for a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">That's where I saw my very first Mickey Mouse film what was still black and white and no words, but it was lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And it was a great experience for a little girl and we had a friend there who was once a captain on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and he always played with me because I wanted to be a little boy and I wanted to be on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and be his mate. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> , we played — a mate. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But, I turned out to be a little girl altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And then we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and we had quite a lot of difficult times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Tell us about — I'd like to know about your family life during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">What — did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Did you have friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and, and according to my mother, everybody was my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was a lonely child. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was all alone and I loved to be alone, but as soon as some other kids arrived and Mommy said I used to become a leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I don't remember that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I just know I always had great time when kids came and while — as I told you before, I was six. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My father was sort of a crazy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He wanted to give anything to his child. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">That time back in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to get some clowns to come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> cost a fortune, but that's how I got the friends because the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> — every child would come — 50, 60 of them you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But then all that stopped and I was alone, but I never felt lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was always a great dreamer. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was always full of dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And since I was a little girl I like to put everything down on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Of course, eventually I lost them all naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But I was always writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Then when it came up to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> .... Well, I, I remember one thing that my father was an absolutely unreligious. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He said he was agnostic. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He was in the Jewish faith, but he ran away from his bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">That much what he didn't believe in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And so he never taught me anything either, but my mother was a little bit more religious and she used to put on the Friday night candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That was about as much religion as I got because my father would take me, say, "Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Let Mommy give us a blessing." </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I went without a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Then as I grew I went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because I was a very pretty girl and all the boys were there on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So it was fun more than religion because I didn't know that I really should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And then when it came to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , then my father decided to put me in a Reformed Church Protestant school. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And my mother first asked him, "Why you want her to go there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my father said, "Because that is the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and she will get the best education." </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I remembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady principal and she would turn to my father and said, "Mr. Mandl, why do you want your little girl to come to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We have no Jewish children." </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And my father said, "I don't like bigots. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I want my child to think for herself, and yours is the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So she smiled and she looked at me, says, "Would you like to come to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I looked her and I fall in love with her at once, I said, "Yes, I do." </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So then she explained to my father that a couple of children are there, but they are not allowed to come to morning services. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Every morning they had a ten minute service, one prayer and two songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And right away I picked up, "I can sing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="57">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But the Protestant teacher, the religious teacher was a wonderful lady, another wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">She was about six foot tall with very black hair and a huge heart and I was like a half pension! </span><span class="sentence" id="60">in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until seven because both of my parents worked and she used to take me and she was the one who taught me about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And she said, "You have to learn because that was the first religion in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And you have to learn some Hebrew." </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So whatever I know, I know from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I was the first and then we got more children so I was there through <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> and <span class="BUILDING">senior high</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I graduated except that I wasn't there on graduation because I got scarlet fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I missed the graduation where I was supposed to be a hostess and that hurt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The only little Jewish kid that could have been the hostess, she couldn't be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But that's how life is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  What about, what about just being a Jewish child, a Jewish teenager in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite wealthy and our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always open and they — more Christians and Aristocrats came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I never felt that I was different from anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And also we traveled quite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My mother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there ' Boarding-school student (French) and so we, we went a lot to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So in ‘36 I was at the — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the Olympic games because my very best friend — and if you ever read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their guest through the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Flying, not running. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I was so proud and I screamed for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And it was a very interesting time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the Nazism as much as they really were. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They didn't like the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They didn't like Jesse Owens because he was black. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They didn't like some other people because they were another color, like Japanese, but still 1t was not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And we had a wonderful time and I met a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, “What religion you are?” </span><span class="sentence" id="83">and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Coming back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through part of <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion. “</span><span class="sentence" id="86">You are a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We don't want you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But I managed, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So because of that I happened to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and I really had Madam Montessori’ teaching me just before she died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  What was she like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  She was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry for today's <span class="BUILDING">Montessori schools</span> because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally retarded, to learn to do things by themselves — to dress by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And today they turned this all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Today they have <span class="BUILDING">Montessori schools</span> where the kids have to be quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That is not for our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The children have to let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But hers was a natural thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And it was a most wonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their shoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> they are bored. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Because in <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> most of them already learn how to write, how to count, how to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And it makes children very difficult to grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But it was a great experience to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I love <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And she lived out in, in a not such a good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> either, but her whole life was the children and the teaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I do have my Montessori diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And then from there I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because I wanted to learn the King's English in a real good way and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Now, of course, I lost it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Waited all the * Maria Montessori years where I lived in different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , it came off. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And after <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that was already ‘39. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And then I decided I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Let's, let's stop one moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">This is 1939 I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Things are changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">What was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like then? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  I was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so I really didn't know what's going on and my parents wanted me to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">In so far it was bad, you felt it coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So, therefore my father used to send us out with Mommy every year because when you left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> — not just Jewish people, but anyone — you had to get so and so much money from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , not more. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then you would go somewhere and you would leave that money and you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> earlier and you said you spent all the money, you had to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So that's how we got our — Mommy had the diamonds and the fur coats and what not since all gone out and we came right back. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">By that time I was a big girl so I could do it with her you know, 16, 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And still it was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You did not feel — because there was always antisemitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But yet like our Regent Horthy’ who always said, "Yes, I am a antisemite, but I cannot get along without my Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Because they were helping and they — the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was pretty well-to-do and it was the “Little Paris” as everybody called it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The King who abdicated, his rendezvous were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He always came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I worked for awhile in the <span class="BUILDING">Ritz Hotel</span> , which was our best, and he came there but we had <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> where you could not make love, so she had to have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> because that was a “Little Paris” where it was a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Did you ever see Edward the Seventh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I saw him once but that was all — not a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> because I wanted to perfect my French. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I had a French mademoiselle for 14 years in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but you forget when you are not constantly talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">She was also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in that — ‘39 almost in September with other three students, we made an auto-stop* tour. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now today you wouldn't dare to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We stood on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and hold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We went all the way to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rivera</span> and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Was a gorgeous trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So we were not ready for what we found when we arrived back because ‘39 was already fallen, but young kids don't care and we were happy and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> when we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But there were a Zionist Congress and while these people had to have a rest, I went out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Geneva</span> to take a rest and have a swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And one day we were out there and that was September 9, ‘40 — 1939 when suddenly all the radios started to > Miklés Horthy * Hitch-hiking (French) blare that the Nazis overrun <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And most of these people were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And it was a heartbreak to see how they runned half-naked to the phones and the families were all <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And then and there, somehow I promised myself that, as I am in a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I'm going to try to help and see if we can make peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , and my parents wanted me to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But the friend — and that's a very tragic thing whom we left all our stuff, and they were Jewish — as a matter of fact the husband was, I think, Orthodox — he kept on saying I should go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">After all, I'm the only child and it's crazy to stay there. “</span><span class="sentence" id="152">The Germans will not come to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in January, 1940, middle of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But I found <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> still very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">American and British film were still shown. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They didn't like people talking English. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They didn't like English. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But we, we did speak it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And that was the time when I taught Congressman Lantos’ not wife yet.? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">She was nine years old, and she was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">She looked like Shirley Temple. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the two of us would walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> talking English, good and loud so everybody can hear us. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But they thought we were foreigners you know, who knows from where. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then my best friend arrived from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and for a couple of weeks, 1t wasn't bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">From ‘40 to ‘43, you really didn't feel different like you did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Antisemitism was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We lived with it as best as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But then in March 1944 — 1940 — yeah, March 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I will never forget that day as long as I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Early morning one of our neighbors running and said to my Father, "The BBC® just announced that our Admiral Horthy is going to quit the Germans and going together with the Allied Forces and he's coming on the radio." </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And my father ran out and brought in the champagne and I looked at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I said, "Poppy. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Please don't drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I don't believe it." </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My father said, "You are too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You don't understand." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And sure enough, Horthy came on and he went as far as to say, "And we are now the friends of the Allies," and at that moment the Germans — the Hitler's hymn came on and they cut off his voice and I just dropped my glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And I left to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Ritz Hotel</span> where I was working there and I also — because I couldn't have no Montessori, nothing worked that time, so I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I wanted to become a Manageress or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And we had a wonderful, wonderful director of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He was Yugoslavian, but he spoke 16 languages perfectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So between him and me we always talked French or English. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And as soon as I arrived, the porter said, "Mr. Marentchic wants you." </span><span class="sentence" id="186">When I got out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , first of all, it was full with beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was a very sunny day. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And I was sure that they were the Americans and the British and I was so happy I said, "Ah, they listed to Horthy, so they all here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We are finished." </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And then Mr. Marentchic took me in his arm and > Annette Tilleman Lantos ° British Broadcasting Corporation he said, "Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and God bless you. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Horthy was arrested, and these are not the Americans and British. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">These are the Russians — these are the Germans — excuse me, the Russians came after. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my father's only words were, "You were right." </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And funnily enough, we were not collected from our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We heard that we have to put on a star, so we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We didn't go out much on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but we still were not restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But they came in and immediately we heard that many, many, many people were taken and we still were not even touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Whether we were lucky, I don't know but we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until — and it was bad because my very best friends lived very far from us and I missed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We still had our telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The radios still worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So we were watching because I had a big, big radio so you can hear the whole world and that's how we knew the news, what's coming in from all <span class="NPIP">over</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  What were the <span class="DLF">streets</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  There were plenty food in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Don't forget, it's an agricultural country. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Even through the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , nobody was every hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Food there was plenty, and the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> — it was still lit up because the bombing didn't start so we had plenty of lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But we didn't go out much. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And you also never know what moment they ring the bell and they take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So we sort of were prisoner of our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but we were still safe — amazingly safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But every day there was a new announcement in tele— in the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">For instance, suddenly the Hungarian Nazis were — who were worse than the Germans — that was the Arrow Cross — so they — when the Germans came in, they said, "The Arrow Cross can take over." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Now what we heard — we didn't see — you see what was the problem was that the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> didn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We didn't believe like here they didn't believe that people are taken away to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We just didn't believe it, that anybody can put out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , that anybody can be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We couldn't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So today when the people tell me, "Why the Americans didn't know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But they couldn't understand it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They were much further than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We were right there, and it was something — it's impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But then suddenly some Czechoslovakian friends arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Rumanian friends came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They took everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But somehow they managed to come away. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Then we started to realize — started to be afraid that any moment anyone.... Letters still arrived from Europe, and I had a correspondence with a Swedish gentlemen for a long time because in a long time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> when you were a girl, who spoke lot of languages and you were a girl scout, then they asked you to be a guide for tourists. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And as I spoke lot of languages, once I was a guide for a whole Swedish group. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And the one Swedish man started to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He has written for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We were corresponding. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I didn't think of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I was young and I had a lot of young men around me and all that so I just thought, "How nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">This nice Swedish man never forget a young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And actually he saved my life before Raoul, but I didn't know that then. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So in any case one day — that was very frightening experience — finally, the bell rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I look out and there is a German soldier standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I look back at my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Well, we couldn't not open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , but then I looked again. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I said, “Oh, my God, I know him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="242">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in 1936, we exchanged cards and he happened to be one of the soldiers coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And my name evidently didn't mean a thing — that a Mandl could be German. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He didn't think I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I said to my parents, ““What shall I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="246">He said, "Well, you have to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He didn't want to come in, thank God. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He just said would I show him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And I was afraid if I say, "No," or, “Why he was sent here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was a very bad feeling so I turned around to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I said, "I'm going to show him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">All I heard is my father said, "Be careful." </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">What else could I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So I went and everything went alright for about an hour and then we came to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he stopped me there and he said, "You see. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That's where I'm going to kill everybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So now I didn't know whether I should open a big mouth and tell him who I am or shall I ask a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So I quickly thought, “Maybe I'll ask a question.” </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I said, "Did ever a Jew hurt you? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Did you know any?" </span><span class="sentence" id="262">He said, "I never knew any." </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I said, "Well, then, why do you want to kill people whom you never even met." </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He said, "Hitler told me to do it, and Iam a German." </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So I quickly looked at my watch and I said, "Oh, you'll have to forgive me, but I have to teach English and I forgot that the time has come. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Goodbye." </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And he let me go and I run. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I have no idea what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But it was a close call. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Yeah, because I really didn't know how to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So then we were all always frightened and then suddenly these two French gentlemen arrived with a note who send them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The two French men arrived and they're not supposed to say it, but they said they were French Underground and could we put them up in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Dad said we'd be delighted, but they were in and out and sometimes we didn't see them for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">One was a peasant and one was a very learned young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">One was a Jew, one was a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and one of them fall in love with my wonderful girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He was unmarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But they went in and out and they did wonderful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I guess they were couriers between <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for the Allies and for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and it's a very exciting time you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Frightening, but when you're young, all you can think, "I have to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I have to survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So now in the midst of all this, then came this announcement. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The first day was that any couples mixed marriages have to separate at once or the Christian party is becoming a Jew and being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Well, within a half an hour, there were thousands of suicides. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It's a very easy way to kill people. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And then they reversed it and they said we changed our minds, but by that time thousands of people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Thank God, my aunt and uncle called. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">My uncle was a grandson of a Unitarian bishop and he was a newspaper man and it was a wonderful marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they called and they said they're going to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I said, "No, you're not Uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Why don't you get some false papers and just disappear." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Said, "I never thought of this." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I said, "Well, then think." </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">He died after the war, natural death, both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But many of them didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Then came the announcement that anyone who not having the Jewish religion can be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They just talked you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was — nothing was now, but we loved to believe everything because we wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> —
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Not having the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">You mean if you convert?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  If you change, if you converting to another religion, then you're not counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But was a lie, of course, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But we wanted to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So who arrived to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">By that time we had a wonderful new principal in my former <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who became later on the Protestant Bishop of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and he had six daughters and I was more in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I was the seventh child, and he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he looked at my father, who was the same age, but he called him “Uncle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="312">He says, "Let me baptize that child. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">She's my seventh daughter, and she knows as much about our religion as we do, and I want her to live." </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And my father said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So we went to his tiny little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and my father started to drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And Pastor Berecky’ said, "Uncle Arnold, stop crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I have full of Jews down in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">If the Germans find out, we all be killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he baptized me more with his tears than with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He cried so bitterly, and he hold me in his arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And then he looked at me, says, "Child, you do what you want after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">If you want to be a Jew again, go back to Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But you are my child, my seventh daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So it was a very emotional and very great thing and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and all his Jews were saved, I guess, who were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And they made me out original papers and they signed for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">You know my birth and all that, that I was born as a Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I took all these papers with grace. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">What else can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And then the next miracle happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">By that time I used to write a lot of poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I did that as a little child too. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And we had one wonderful newspaper and I send him one what I wrote during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And suddenly I got two little letters in the mail that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">One was handwritten from the editor of this newspaper and he very clearly just said “Dear Madam....” Oh, that time I wrote under an assumed name and it was “Rolopa” — what meant “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ,” and I took the first three names and that what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So he addressed it to “Madam Rolopa,” and he said that, "I loved your poem but unfortunately the censor would not allow me to publish it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But I keep it with all my souvenirs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I screamed and my mother was just in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , "Why you screaming?" </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I said, "Mommy, Mommy. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Can you imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Handwritten and he kept my poem! </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That's better than if they publish it." </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I was — I have his letter still. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I was very proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The second letter was a very — with little white letters, but within the back it said <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I said, "What does ’ Albert Berecky the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> want from me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And I opened it up and they said, "Could you please come to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I was dumfounded. “</span><span class="sentence" id="349">Why, why — what do they want from me? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And how do I get there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Because by that time you couldn't really get to any <span class="BUILDING">foreign embassies</span> without probably being arrested on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with my yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So my cousin that time dated a very wonderful Christian boy and he said, "Well, what's the problem? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I'll take you." </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I said, "How?" </span><span class="sentence" id="355">He said, "Leave it to me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And he arrived in a huge big black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes Benz</span> , and he had the German flag on the front and he pushed me in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And he said, "Now, you're in. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We can go." </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And he took me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Nobody stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">How would they dare— [Technical conversation]
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Now we're on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Now let's start with the story about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So my cousin had a boyfriend who was a Christian and he said, "It's no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I'll take you up to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And he arrived with a huge black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes Benz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">He had the Nazi flag on it, and he had a Nazi uniform, and he was very rough with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He pushed me into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and when I was in he said, "So now, we can relax and I'll take you." </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So nobody stopped us and I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And then we arrived up there, it was — first, you know it was very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I, I walked in and there was the Minister Danielsson.* </span><span class="sentence" id="373">He was the Ambassador then and he looked up and said, "Who is that Nazi?" </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I said, "He is not a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He just brought me up here." </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He says, "Clever," you know, “but you never know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Anyhow, he and the Hungarian First Secretary, whose name was Mr. Mezey’ — he was then the Secretary there — they needed somebody who speaks Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And they took me in and they told me first that they want to tell me the story about the wonderful Danish king who stood up for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He said that, “I don't know any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I only know Danes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And he put on a yellow arm band and I was so stunned because we didn't know all this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And after he told me that story then he told me about King Gustav the Fifth,'® the Swedish King, who had told all the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> — and he blew that up as big as this, you know, on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> all over <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> — “Anyone who has family, friends, business associates in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , would they come to the Foreign Department and we will help." </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And I said, "Yeah, but why do you call me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And he says, "That's my point now. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">You have a fiancé." </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I looked at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I says, "I have a what?" </span><span class="sentence" id="388">He said, "You didn't know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I says, "No Sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I told the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I didn't know I have a fiancé. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He said, "Well, your fiancé immediately went to the foreign department and he said, "If the war wouldn't be on, she already would be my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So she is Swedish and please take care of her." </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And I stood there, you know, and I, I was frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I had no words and I said, “I, 1 am a Swede? </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And we go make your papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I * Ivan Danielsson ” Dénes von Mezey ' Oscar Gustav Adolf said, "Oh, my God." "</span><span class="sentence" id="399">And that's not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You're going to stay with us on the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I said, "Oh no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I can't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I have my parents." </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He said, "Well, we will try to save your parents, but first comes you. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We are now responsible for you, and I need some change of clothes and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You're going to stay here." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I was stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So—
QUESTION:  This had all come from this young man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  That young man whom we wrote the letter, letters for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I still don't know whether — well, I will tell you, on the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Anyways, my friend Steven, said, "Well should she come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And I said, "No, I think it's better if we send down to her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">You, you can go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> along and we send down one of our employees here and he will talk to the parents and we write the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I felt first very bad and, you know, conscious that I am just leaving my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But we are young, and I wanted so badly to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And it was really a terrible thing maybe, but I just — I wanted to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And so this man went down and told my parents that what happened and my parents said, "Ah, that's wonderful." </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And they gave them the toothbrush and change of clothes and I for three weeks a guest of the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I had a wonderful little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> overlooking the rose garden and I found out I wasn't the only guest in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">First, there was that famous Nobel prize winning professor, Szent-Gyorgyi,'!! </span><span class="sentence" id="422">who has found the vitamin. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He wasn't Jewish, but he was a stout anti-Nazi and they had to put him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But eventually the Germans were after him and so they gave him a new name like Swenson and a new lookout and they put him somewhere else and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But there was another wonderful young woman with two little boys and she was German, married to a Swede, and she got stuck with the children in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And she went away after on the very last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that could get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She left with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Later on we met in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So I wasn't alone there, you know, and found out there were other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But three weeks I was there, and in the three weeks the big bombing started. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And they really started and they were day and night, and the German artillery was right above us and we could see whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We were in the <span class="REGION">Buda side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Have you ever been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">A beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it was a pity to see how everything was bombed out, but it had to be done and we were all hoping that the Americans come and then we be liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But after three weeks we knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My dear friend arrived back with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> and demanded my return immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And the Minister said, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He said, "Well, maybe you don't know, but the Hungarian Nazi Party made every second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> now a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Every second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> has a big yellow star out because they think that the Americans will not bomb because they don't want to bomb the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Of course, that wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They bombed the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They bombed the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , but the 'l Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Christian — from the <span class="BUILDING">Christian houses</span> like where we were on with my parents, that became a <span class="BUILDING">Christian house</span> , so my parents had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And thank God, my grandmother had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where my — my grandmother wasn't alive, but my aunt was there and her best friend who was also married to a Christian but he wanted to be with them, so he moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And Steven came every day, so we had two Christians helping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> and he said, "I have to come back because the Arrow Cross comes every day and reading the list of people in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and if I am not there, and my name is still on, then they would kill my parents." </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So they had a little argument and the Minister said, "No, because we are responsible." </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And he said, "Well, she's responsible for her parents." </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I just spoke I said, "I'm going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So then they said, "Not with him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I should go down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and I should have one of the employees will go and sit on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> because they want to know exactly where I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So I went down with the promise that everyday when they allow us out — we were allowed one hour a day to go out shopping or whatever — that I call and, thank God, the phones were still working. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Bombing or no bombing, we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">The phones were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I did call up every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So I went down with this young man and when I got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I looked at him and he did like this and he wrote a little note and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And of course, my welcome <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was not so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that I had three weeks of <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , but I can't blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I mean, maybe I shouldn't have done it, but as I said I wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I mean you have only one life. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But I was back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I called up every day and I think I wasn't down longer than a weeks and a half and I called and a Hungarian secretary came Mezey and said, "Agnes, you have to get up here at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Something new happened." </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I said, "I'll try, but I don't know how." </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He said, "Well, maybe you're friend will bring you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Tell him we will not keeping you here." </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So when he came I said, "Could you just take me up once more?" </span><span class="sentence" id="468">He said, But you're not going to stay there and jeopardize the family?" </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I says, "No, I'll come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I went up and there was Raoul Wallenberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  At this point I want to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I want to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I don't want to stop at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Bonnie, can we stop the tapes please? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Do we really have that much? </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Okay, let's keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We have 20 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Tell us about Raoul.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So Danielsson and Mezey introduced him to me, and he spoke English and German, and I think he spoke German that time because I couldn't speak Swedish yet, and his first question was, "Agnes, would you work with me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I said, "I'd be delighted Sir, but I still have a Star." </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And they all started laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I said, "Why you laughing? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I can't run around in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="486">He said, "You won't. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We already have prepared papers for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And the same day they send me all alone with the Star, but somebody followed me from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> where the police chief cut off my Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I don't know what — how they bribed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He never told me, but they must have bribed the Hungarian especially because the war was probably almost over in ‘44, and they wanted to be in good foot with the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">They didn't know that the Russians are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So we all didn't know that that we are sold out, the whole Balkan, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">To the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Well, anyways he cried and I thought I was in <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I must be dead if this police chief is crying while he cuts off my star and I walked right back to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> and I said, "Here I am." </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Second, go get your parents' <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back." </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And I said, "I beg your pardon, Sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And they laughed again. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I said, "You're laughing, but I have to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He said, "I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">That we can't do it, but there is a new housing commission." </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You should have seen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I mean there were maids who used to work in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They walked in and they took the former employers fur coats and everything and they walked for breakfast with big furs and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They had no idea, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And they took all the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> from everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So he said, "Get to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and get your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">What I didn't even remember, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was written on my father's name, but I looked at him by that time and I got — you saw right away my, my identification from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Actually, everybody in that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> needed an identification, even a shoe cleaner on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , because otherwise you couldn't walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">This was wartime. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And so I got mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You have them I think or you will have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I walked in with my head absolutely high because now I was a Wallenberg girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I walked in and I sort of threw my paper to, to the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I said, "What can happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Either he shoots me or not." </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And he looked at me awfully ugly and without a word he signed and gave it back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I said, "Oh, oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Raoul, whom did you bribe again?" </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Something must have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Somebody I heard yelling, "There is a bloody Jew going," but I just went with my head up right to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And I walk in and there is a — that was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and the superintendent is there and I walk in and he was so stunned that I am alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">You know they had no idea what happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And I said, "Hello," and his wife started to cry because I loved her very much, but he was a leech. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He lived on us for years and he looks at me and he said, "What do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I said, "Here. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">My <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back!" </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He said, "My daughter already has that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Whereby the wife says, "No, our daughter has already another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So I don't know what he did to his wife after, but I said, "I like to have the receipt official." </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So he said, "Well, you have to go to our lawyer and he should give it back to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I said, "Look, where is the lawyer living?" </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I went to the lawyer and as soon as I walked in, the lawyer looked at the paper and he saw it was official so not much he could do and he said, "Yes, but that has a price." </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And I thought, "Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">If I have to give him money, I don't have." </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I said, "Well, what's the price?" </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And he said, "You will have to testify that I was so good to the Jewish people." </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They all wanted that by that time, of course, because whoever comes in, they would have hanged them because they killed thousands of them on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I saw it myself one day this green shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">There was a little boy of two years old with a star, and he just — “bang” and killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">No reason to kill a child of two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But he had a yellow star on, why not kill? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So in any case, I promised him anything and in the meantime my finger was like this [interviewee gestures] in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I, “The hell with you all, just give it to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So I walked back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Now he couldn't say anything, because the lawyer signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So we go upstairs and I had a very horrible feeling, “What will I find?” </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I found an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> except we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span> was locked, and all that and we opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">All our stuff was in there, the paintings, the books, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , and for a moment I thought to myself, "Gee, He isn't as bad as I thought," until he opened his mouth and he said, "I'll get even with you yet." </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But I figured the — in this ball game, the ball 1s now in my <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And I got my telephone back within a day and I had our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back and I had a telephone, so I was in constant contact with Raoul and everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Now I wanted my parents badly to get out of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> — to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , and I screamed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I shouldn't have done it, but I was so excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I said, "We got the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back again, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back." </span><span class="sentence" id="562">In the meantime, Raoul, as he promised, he got my parents some papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They're not supposed to come out of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but I said, "Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="565"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I missed them and also my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Her mother couldn't come then. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I don't know where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And I took them all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">My cousin had papers from Salvadorian papers and the Swiss family helped her so we all went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And then we started the big work with Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">That time I was—
QUESTION:  Excuse me, won't you? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Would you pause a minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Tell me you, when you said when you met Raoul Wallenberg, you seemed to know all about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Did you know about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="578">All I knew is that there is a young man and I said to myself, "What is he doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And first I think and that was the feeling that he thought it was an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But he found out in one day, half a day, that this wasn't an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">This 1s something that you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And he was a most fantastic organizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">A quick thinker! </span><span class="sentence" id="584">His first question was from — he had one friend and that was Per Anger, whom I don't know if you interviewed yet, but Per Anger was then the First Secretary of the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And he was an old friend of Raoul and he asked him the first moment, “What have you done for the people here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Because it was not only Jews, but it was also anti-Nazi, aristocrats, and Christians, whom he had to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">It was not just the Jews, but mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And they said, "We have given out 800 real passports." </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Now that was what I had, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And Raoul was beside himself. “</span><span class="sentence" id="591">Two hundred — two — 2,8000 — no, 280,000 people, you give 800 pass-passports? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Well, that's nothing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And from the first day on, he actually took over the whole <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The Minister didn't like it very much because after all, he was a diplomat and he was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And when he asked him — he came as a third secretary — he had to have a diplomatic passport because otherwise, he couldn't travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And he said, "Mr. Danielsson, you'll have to understand that when you go and argue with the people, you speak as a diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I don't." </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And that's how he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He was like a devil. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">You know to us, he spoke like the greatest brother, like a little child, and he was full of jokes all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And when we were a little bit down, then he would come up with jokes or he would imitate Mussolini!” </span><span class="sentence" id="602">or he would imitate Hitler or Eichmann.!? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Whatever he could make us laugh, he made us hysterically laugh because that was his whole nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">What he felt <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , we don't know because he never showed. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The only thing I knew that he was deathly afraid and that was the bombs because that he couldn't hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But we all were afraid from that and he said now, "Whatever happens," because when the Americans come, when they bombed, it went all the way through to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">When the Russians came the two floors upstairs disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">One was our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">It's not all bombed out you know, but with the Americans it went, and it didn't matter whether it was the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Christians houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Bombed! </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And that was it, and the British too. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But Raoul took over immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was like a wildfire that there is some “angel” who is here to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So the Jewish Community and those of anti-Nazi Christians, they all came and Raoul — in two days we had 350 people helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And we didn't get paid as you always hear, "He's a paid employee." </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Nobody was paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We were paid because we had our wonderful identification, but quite a lot from our 350 people died and were taken and were killed, so those who were — we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Some of them didn't kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Not because that they all say that that was saved their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It did not save our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">It was a part of our work with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And it was funny because the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> only had 12 employees and Raoul had 350 in days, but he needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And in no time, he opened a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he was looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">There was lots of doctors who were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">He found them, and they worked for him and the Red Cross nurses and the other nurses, and many of them died and many of them lived and helped him ‘til the last moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But he was, he was never for a moment without thinking, “what can I do next?” </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And he was like a machine, you know “Go! </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Go! </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Go!” </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And so all of us became like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I also slept sometimes one or two hours a night because there was no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">We always had to do something because there were always something new what Eichmann was thinking of and especially the Arrow Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So not only that we had these helpers but we had quite a few very rich people and they offered Raoul their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So we did in two weeks — we had about 60 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the two sides of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> , where the Swedish flag went on and we had Nazi-clad, Nazi-clad Hungarian, Jewish boys standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> taking care of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and nobody could step in because it was a <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And Per Anger writes it in his book and he says that at that time — because in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , they always made jokes whether there was a war or not — that the Swedish government was the greatest landlord in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And we had those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and it was good because our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> had to move every day because they were after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Eichmann '2 Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini 'S Adolf Eichmann was after Raoul all the time, but he was not afraid from Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">He invited him for dinner, and then he forgot about it, and he had to call the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Embassy</span> — a Swedish guy, and he said, "Do you have any wine and food? </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I forgot I invited Eichmann for dinner." </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But he not only invited Eichmann for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">He asked one of the Jewish helpers to serve him so it would be fun to see how he reacts to somebody with the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And we did it because it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Raoul wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But at that time we were already bombed heavily, and Raoul had shirt open, and this guy here arrived with all the guns around him, but he couldn't kill Raoul on the <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span> you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  Let's stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Let's back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">What do you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Which guy arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Eichmann.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  With, with a soldier and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And Raoul — it was already no light, we had only candlelights — and Raoul opened the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and it was the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And he said, "Eichmann, look out. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Look what you're doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And Eichmann said, "They deserve it." </span><span class="sentence" id="658">He said, "Stop talking and stop killing the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You didn't win. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">The Germans lost, so give up." </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And Eichmann said, "No, I will not give up and my only thing is that you are in my way." </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And Raoul very quietly said, "But I am not enough in your way." </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He just didn't take it seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And then Eichmann left. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But he had to have his say and he had to show it to him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I wish he would be there when Eichmann had to be hanged or whatever they did to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Unfortunately, he probably doesn't even know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So any case, it was wild because I was for awhile — I was just hostessing, you know, because thousands of people came up to us for the Schutz-pass'* what was also his design. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He designed — first, he went to the Hungarian and said, "Are there still <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going between here and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I'd like to take the Jews off your hand," he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And they said, "Yes, Mr. Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">You can take 5,000 people." </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So he came back to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">He says, "5,000 and they will never allow me another one." </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So that's no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So then he designed this Schutz-pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And, of course, with 350 people we had millions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the Minister sat and signed each of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Now I am afraid you will hear many times they said they were fake papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Not one of them were ever fake. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">If they say it was too many, yes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably made 50,000 of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But they were not fake because everyone of them 1s signed by the Swedish Minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three years Underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printing machine</span> and he figured he will come to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and see what he can help there. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And there he had Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed “Danielsson” and '4 Protective pass (German) some people found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And they called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He said, "You can't do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, "But if you can save one single life, go ahead and do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like Raoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">But it was not Raoul's papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They were not fake, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And these people just don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Also, they say he gave us passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He never gave passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was a pass, and the pass and if you will read my book, you will see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I have it translated. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The picture of the person is on there, with the signature, and it says, "The above, the bearer of this paper is protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings.” </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And if and when we collectively can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , then they will be going and then in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in 14 days this paper will be invalid. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">It doesn't say anywhere it's a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It doesn't say anywhere that he can take his star off. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It just says he's protected by the Swedish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And then when these people had to be shifted out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , then Raoul just picked them up and in these 60 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> we put them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">These were our safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and it was not comfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Raoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to go in the meantime on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Now, on the <span class="DLF">road</span> he didn't take us girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He took the Red Cross and he took some of the diplomats. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And by that time he called up the Swiss diplomat and said, "Help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We need some help. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">We need you people doing this." </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So then we got the Swiss involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We got the Portuguese involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We got the Papal Nuncio involved very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And so he had enough men to go with him including Thomas Veres, who was always with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He was a young boy with a camera hidden and he made all these pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because they were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul and he would shout, "Raoul, jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They're killing you." </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And Raoul jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">But he went out after the people all the way to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> to get the people back. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">As I said, it was the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't know — and you said, you've never been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> — the <span class="DLF">border</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , that was then a five hour car ride, and they were walking these people in the snow without shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Children, sick people, old people, and they died, and people trampled over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And Raoul was beside himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So he went on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and one day Per Anger had met him and Raoul had — have we finished?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I want to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">We'll change tapes and then I want to pick up with this march. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It's important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  Okay Bonnie. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We're back on camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You were—
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I was telling that Raoul went after these people all the way to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But one of these occasions he had Per Anger with him too, and he had a big black book and on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , he stopped and screamed at the Nazis in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">He spoke perfect German. "</span><span class="sentence" id="738">How dare you are taking our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They're all our protected people. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And all of those people, who have my papers turn around.” </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And one of my very good girlfriends from here now, she said, "Well, what can happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="742">They'll kill her anyhow." </span><span class="sentence" id="743">She turned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">She didn't have any paper — and her sister and her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And "Get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And then he started to open his black book and started to read names like a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And people caught on, those who could still walk and they walked up whether that was their name or not, and he brought about thousand people back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to these safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Per Anger said to him, "Raoul, I didn't know we have a black book and you have names? </span><span class="sentence" id="750">When did you do that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And Raoul started hysterically laughing and he said, "I'll show it to you when I done it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And he opens it up and not one single name. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="754">But that was his idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">He had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He had to save people. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And the same thing, he had drivers licenses and insurance papers, whatever he could find in Hungarian, what the Germans couldn't read. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And he took it all the way to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he demanded to open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and he yelled to the people, "I have your papers here. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Get out, Mr. So and So." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And there to some people, you know, "Aw, maybe we can get away." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And he handed them — some of them got the Schutz-pass, not with their name, but who cares, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And insurance papers and tax papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">You name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">He brought them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But I don't know if you saw the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">There was one and that was the truth that he took <span class="BUILDING">home</span> thousands and in the meantime they killed another thousand and you could hear it, but you can't save everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He always played with his own life because he can be killed any moment, but he didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He just wanted the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Once he was about 250 young men was taken and they were told that they will clean up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> from the bombing and he knew exactly that's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So he went after them, again just with two of his colleagues, and again a lot of paper and this Nazi looks at him and he knew who he was and he said, "Wallenberg, if there is one man who doesn't have a paper, I kill him on the spot." </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And Raoul looks at him and said, "That's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">You can kill him." </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And from the 250, 249 already down, everybody had the paper and one give him eye contact with Raoul. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Was a doctor, and he is in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And Raoul understand immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">He had no idea what the man's name is and he says, "Johnny, you left your paper at my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> again." </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And he handed him a paper and off they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="779">But he always — he came up with stories that, that you wouldn't believe that anyone can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Now we had this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And also it was full of patients and also full of doctors and nurses, and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It was already a very, very snowy day in the beginning of December, or end of November, and Raoul had one wonderful thing what I could never learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He remembered names, and once he had your name he would never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I forget it in five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">He never made a mistake, to call me Ava and somebody else Aggie. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">He knew who was Aggie and he knew who was Ava. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">No mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So what he wanted to do — the Hungarian Nazi party, this horrible Arrow Cross, they had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in every section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And he send out some little spy to learn every officer's name to be sure that he gets the right people. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And he never forgot those names, and he knew which one in which <span class="NPIP">section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">One day he comes to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in this horrible snow and he was unshaven and probably hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Who knows where he was, saving people. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And he comes in and he finds three little Hungarian punks. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I mean punks because they were 12 and 13 year old analphabets, but they gave them the gun and they said, "Kill." </span><span class="sentence" id="795">If you tell that to a 12 year old, “Kill, then you won't get punished for it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So here they stand with the gun and the doctor's hand is up and the patients are shaking and Raoul — I was there, it so happened on that day — and Raoul had to think very fast, and he hit these three kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I've never seen anybody hitting so strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Then he doesn't speak Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Only a few words, and somehow he managed to tell them in half German and half Hungarian, "Get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">You are in a <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And, of course, the guns fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So we had three guns in no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And he said, "Get your officers in here." </span><span class="sentence" id="805">These three boys ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I mean, they were little kids and they were frightened because he was just powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">In three minutes, an officer walks in, a Hungarian, and they all spoke some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And our Raoul as quiet as nothing happened, looked at his watch and says, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And the guy looks up and says, "How'd you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?" </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And Raoul pushed up his shoulders and he said, "I know everybody's name and besides you are in big trouble." </span><span class="sentence" id="812">He says, "I am not in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">You are." </span><span class="sentence" id="814">He says, "No, you are because by mistake you killed a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you." "</span><span class="sentence" id="815">No, I never killed anyone." "</span><span class="sentence" id="816">Yes, you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He died here in our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And before he died, he asked us to call the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and your name is up at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They're killing you. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So get out and bring me what I ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Medication! </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And maybe I will help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Without a word the guy ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And all of us looked at Raoul, you know, and the doctor start laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He says, "Raoul, what the hell did you just do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And Raoul says, "Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Nothing." </span><span class="sentence" id="828">He said, "How did you know it was Simon." </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He said, "I didn't know he was Simon, but that's the name of the officer there and we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">It was Simon." </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And then the doctor looked at him again and he says, "Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here dying." </span><span class="sentence" id="832">He said, "Naturally not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been." </span><span class="sentence" id="833">You see, now that was the way he saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">It could have been a trouble for him at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">He did the same thing when he saved 70,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">We had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">A real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And that was just about on the end when the Russians were already outside the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and Eichmann laughed many times, "Kill everybody," and they put up the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Now by that time, we had quite a few Nazis who wanted to save their life and the Hungarian Arrow Cross and they helped Raoul and one of them came to him one day and he said, "Go immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Eichmann put up the bombs, and they're going to kill the 70,000 people." </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And Raoul says very quietly, "Oh, gosh and just our two Red Cross girls are in there delivering medicine and food." </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He says, "Get back to your <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and tell them that the Germans called off the killing." </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And now it's not like in the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">In the film, he went himself to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">But it's not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We were all in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and like a little child he says, "Now, listen to what I'm going to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="847">He picks up the phone and with his gorgeous German, he calls the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and he said, "This is Lieutenant Krauss(ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Okay? "</span><span class="sentence" id="849">I want to talk to” —I think Veesenmayer!? </span><span class="sentence" id="850">was the General's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I can't remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And in the meantime, he constantly looks at us, you know, and we all started laughing because he just made a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And when the General came to the phone, he said, "This is Wallenberg." </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Of course, he couldn't hang up on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And he said, "I really astonished what you are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I understand you are a very highly decorated First World Officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">How can you take it on your conscious to kill 70,000 innocent people, plus my two Swedish girls who are in there now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Whereby he must have answered, "Eichmann ordered," because our Raoul said, "Eichmann? </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Didn't you know he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I had lunch with him yesterday." </span><span class="sentence" id="861">That was a complete lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Now you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Eichmann could have stood right beside that general, but he has to risk it because there were 70,000 people’s lives on the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Whereby he answered, "I didn't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="865">He said, "Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Then, I order you to call off the killing, because if not then I as a diplomat promise you that you will be hanged before your officers." </span><span class="sentence" id="867">He hung up. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">In two minutes, he called off the killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And we have quite a few old people today like that who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">They didn't know until today who saved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So you see, his life was all — what he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">He was lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">He was cheating. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">He was bribing. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">But that was the only way. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">He did millions of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I mean by that time we had our guns too and he dressed his boys up. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They took — the Arrow Cross came in and took people out of our safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> through the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So Raoul turned to our young boys and he said, "You have the Nazi uniforms." "</span><span class="sentence" id="880">Yeah." "</span><span class="sentence" id="881">Get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Get dressed." "</span><span class="sentence" id="883">Where we going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="884">He said, "You're going after them and bring them back." </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Three or four boys went screaming at the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They all spoke German, and they said, "We have to take them to the <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="887">No, we have to take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">You have phony papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And the Germans said, "No, I don't have." "</span><span class="sentence" id="890">Yes, that's a phony papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Took it from him. "</span><span class="sentence" id="892">Turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">We go." </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So these poor people, they didn't know where they going and then finally, one of these littlhe Hungarian came up to somebody and says, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We are the Wallenberg people." </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And they took them all back. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Now we had phony papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">We had real papers, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">But you see this — you have to do everything so 'S Edmund Veesenmayer fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Now, it was not always easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">His big, big heartbreak was when he had an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">He had two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> but in the one, we had 79 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And, of course, Raoul visits there bombing time and he picked up those crying kids and he would start making animal noises and telling them stories just to calm them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And the kids were talking, laughing and forgot that the bombs were falling like crazy because that was Raoul. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And he visited them as much as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Not every day because he had to go out to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> and who knows where. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But he came to the children as much as he could, always with candies in his pockets and with just to make the kids happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">He was a clown without the nose and everything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And one day he arrived and found the children all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">We found out from the guard — was a young boy, who was also shot, but thank God it went in his shoulder, so he could tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Young, young, young, 13, 14 year old kids and started to just shoot the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">One little boy went under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> because his mother taught him before they parted and he thought his mother was dead and Raoul found the little boy walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and said to him, "Whenever you get in trouble, get under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And these damn Hungarians were so busy shooting, they didn't even look under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Just kill the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And one more was saved, because she had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So those two kids were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">The rest of it were all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">They just killed them for fun! </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And this was the only time I ever seen Raoul Wallenberg down on his knees crying, bitterly crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">For about 10 minutes, he couldn't get to himself because killing children, that was more than he could take. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And then suddenly he got up, and he was again like seven foot tall, and said, "We're not going to stop fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I want to save this nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I want the children to make peace in this world." </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And he went on fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And it must have hurt him so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I do hope you will have a chance once to invite that wonderful young lady who has been saved because of scarlet fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Twice she was saved by Raoul, and she is now teaching in <span class="BUILDING">Mercer College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">She's teaching humanities and languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And you should have her. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I will give you the address after. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">She's a marvelous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So in any case this was the two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And then Raoul was out again, when we heard that they shooting people into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And it was December, just before Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And what the Hungarians did — 1t was no snow — it was a no stars, only heavy snowing and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , the first time in 40 years was really frozen with huge icicles. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And they thought this is the best time to kill people because nobody will look for them and in the dark and they were cowards these, these Hungarian Nazi men. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">But Eichmann said, "Do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="939">So what they did, they roped three people together and then they shot the middle one and, of course, all three of them fell in and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Some of them, I understand, swam out somehow and survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">But Raoul arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the third day to hear about that from wherever he was, and he was beside himself. "</span><span class="sentence" id="942">What will Eichmann do next? </span><span class="sentence" id="943">How can they do that to human beings?" </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And this was the first time he turned to us and asked, “How many of you can swim?” </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I was the only one with three other diplomats, men, who put up my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I said, "I was taught swimming in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Let's go." </span><span class="sentence" id="948">IT had no idea where we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So we went with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">We knew where they were shooting on the right, and on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">We turned off the motors. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">We had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , and every time we had to synchronize. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">When they shot we had to fall in too, so that the splash goes at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Not that the Hungarians had time to listen because they were so busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">They were afraid they would be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So we — when they fell we jumped and thanks to the icicles the rope hang on to the ice, and we knew where there is a rope, there is a body. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And we started to pull them out and then the nurses and the doctors were there, put them in, changed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Fifty people we saved — what is nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">But it's more than if we had no Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we couldn't move anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And then that was over and then we had one more big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">When they advertised — the “lovely” Germans — that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such and such a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> next morning to clean up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , we knew again that they will take them right out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, "You all have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working in the <span class="REGION">Buda side</span> in a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> because as I told you we always had to move our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And there was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">But what was so amazing that 1t was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice, but moonlit. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Why they didn't come on that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">The CIA’® must have been very good and the <span class="BUILDING">Scotland Yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">They didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And suddenly Raoul arrived around midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said, "Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?" </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And so we said, "Yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And then he told us quickly a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">He said, "I don't want you to look up, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And naturally we all looked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">He says, "Don't look up. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Just work. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">It's only the <span class="BUILDING">German Headquarters</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And he did like he didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">If Raoul doesn't care if the German has <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , why should we, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I mean it was crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We were taken over by his strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And it was really a feeling, “If he can do it, then we should help him with everything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So I was the lucky one who was first ready with about 500 of his papers and I — he embarrass — embraced me and he said, "Be careful." </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And I said, "Yes Sir, I will." </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And I remember there was no one around. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I went with the curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And I walked across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> because all my people were on the <span class="REGION">Pest side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And it was a very emotional going because I had to ring some door bells and some friends of mine came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they said, "Aggie, what you doing out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I said, "Please don't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Don't ask. '</span><span class="sentence" id="996">© Central Intelligence Agency Just take this. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">An angel sent it to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And we kissed and cried and I went on delivering all 500. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">All I heard is my footstep on the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">But no bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and finally I sit down on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and then it dawned to me what I just done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And I said to myself, "Are you crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">You could have been killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Then like Raoul Wallenberg would say, "Get killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Because the Hungarians and the Germans, they're cowards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">They wouldn't be daring to be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a curfew." </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And I went to sleep with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I woke up at six o'clock in the morning that my two girlfriends were thrown out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because of the pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And they ran all the way to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they — actually they spoke more German than Hungarian because they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But the German officer picked up their German and said something very ugly to them in German what they can do with the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">But the kids made one look at him and they turned around and started to run and he never shot after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">He let them run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">So the paper had a big “something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">We don't know what Raoul did really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">If you read a few books now, you can put it together what really happened and what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">But it was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So my two girls friend are actually in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">They are grandmothers, both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">But they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">So it is incredible the things he has done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And then that was already Christmastime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I have never seen him again, because I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Maybe it was partly the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , a little bit cold, but it was worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And we only found out after that evidently I had a nervous breakdown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">But it didn't come out only in the afternoon when I got a bit excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I ran a big fever and there were no doctors to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">They were either hiding or being out on the front or they were Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But my super said he will find me one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And he came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he said, "Ach, just a little cold." </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And that is not funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">It was a needle what you give for animals, but neither my mother or me knew to, and he said, "I give her sulfa." </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And very smilingly, he gave me the sulfa, and five minutes after he left, I was in a deep coma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And my mother was in a panic and the phones still worked, so she called there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">The super promised me that one of these days he'd get rid of me, but it didn't work yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">He tried it once more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Anyway, Mother called a friend and the friend found a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And the doctor came and he asked my mother what happened and Mommy said, "He left —I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">He left a needle there." </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And he says, "Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">He poisoned that child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">This is for an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">You don't give that to people." </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Somehow they found an anti-whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So it took a—I got back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">My mind stayed alright except I had jaundice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So I was incapacitated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">I couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I never saw Raoul again, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">That was my end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And then the bombing really became so big and the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> disappeared so we could not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And that was “part one” of this little life there — very exciting life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And then the Soviet arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And it wasn't better at all than the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">If it's possible, 1t was even worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Because they just picked people up from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> — never mind who it was — and shipped them right off to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">The officers arrived in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> and American boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">The soldiers came all the way from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">They were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">They attacked old women, young women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">They only ones they saved were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">They loved children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">They washed their face in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , and they made their business in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathtub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We couldn't believe it that they were that primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Some of them stole the watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">They had watches from here to here, and they came up to you and say, “tick tock, tick tock.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">It was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So it was not much better as what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And I had no idea what happened on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , what happened to the legation until one day on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> over came one of our lawyers who was a Czechoslovakian who worked with Raoul and he didn't tell me that Raoul disappeared by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He just said that the whole legation has been taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And I assumed that Raoul was with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And I said, "Where did they take them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And he said, "Debrecen." </span><span class="sentence" id="1078"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And he said, "Do you want to help them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And I looked at him and I said, "Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">How could I help?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">You know I was all excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And he said, "Well, you have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And my parents right away, “No, she's not going anywhere." </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I said, "Wait, Mommy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Let Paul!’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">tell me what he wants." </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I said, "Why <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">He said, "Because <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> is already occupied by French, British, Russian, and Hungarian, and that is the only available <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Swedish embassy</span> in the whole Balkan, and somebody has to go there and ask that Ambassador to help this one." </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And I said, "Can I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">How?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">He said, "Well, it's very easy because the Rumanians are now allowed to repatriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So if you became a Swede legally, now you can become an illegal Rumanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Just don't open your mouth because you don't speak Rumanian." </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I said, "Well, that's great." </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">So my parents were very much, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">No." </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I said, "Mommy and Poppy, the Swedish government saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">At least what I can do, save them and Raoul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I mean what they have done for all of us." </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So they knew that I have a hard neck and anything they will tell me, I will say, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So they — Paul said, "I'll come back in a couple of days, bring you the papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Now how you get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">We had the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> as we had to deport the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And we were — I was told by a few people that some people are disappearing middle of the trip by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence"

<p><span class="sentence" id="1395">ANSWER:  Well, at this point, it was very exciting because I have a huge family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">And all I wanted to tell them this marvelous story about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">First of all, they didn't want to hear anything — not about Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">They weren't interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And I kept on saying, "But this is such a wonderful story." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I told you we are not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And don't think so much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">We don't have it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1403"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had everything, but they didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">So it was a very unpleasant four weeks when we got our marching orders that we can go with the Norwegian Red Cross through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and then from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Well, the Swiss knew exactly that we had no food in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at all, and they took everybody's food and everybody's money away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">Again, I was all the way in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and I took all my money and I put it in my shoe and I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">So at least I had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Food, they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">So we went three days and we didn't eat because there was no food in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> no where. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">We went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">We went through whole lot of things, and then we arrived in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and it's incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">There was a whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> made up with maybe millions of showers with hot water and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">You have never seen so much food in your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">We all got sick because we didn't — we couldn't eat that much, but the Danes just didn't know what to do because there were Norwegians who were stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And there were Danes and there were Swedes and there were us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">They were incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">Our drivers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> — on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> by the way were Nazi prisoners, and I will never forget that, that nobody — all the Norwegians, the Danes, they spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">None of them wanted — but they decided it is dangerous because all the signs through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> now in English and there are <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there are no <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Somebody has to do it, so I used to be the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">So they said, "Will you speak to them in German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">So I said, "Do I have to?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Yeah." </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">So I sat with the driver and he still had the Swastika hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Today, I'm laughing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">If he would have known that a Jew is giving him the directions and the orders what to do, I think he would have killed us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">But it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And we made tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1430">QUESTION:  We need to — excuse me, we need to condense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">Could you now tell us when you got into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">Just very briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">How long you were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1434">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Sweden</span> , I got in, in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">October four or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">And I first went to my fiance's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">First, they wouldn't let me in and that's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">I'll tell you another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And then we went up for a weekend to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> already together with his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And there was two gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">He and another gentleman who met me, and they were greeting me with a fist like this and I said, "What's that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And he said, "Oh, don't you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">That's the Communist's greetings." </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">And my stomach went down again and I said, "Huh?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">Tells me his greetings, but I thought it was just stupid joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Anyhow, next day, that was Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Monday, I got in contact with everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">My first question was, "Where is Raoul?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1449">We don't know," was the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">And then I told them about my fiancé whom I have to marry, and I told them that I am very disturbed because he greet me like that and you will have to understand that I cannot marry a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And they say, "Well, we understand that, but after all, he...." I said, "Yes, I know." </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">They found out he was one of the top Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And what happened is that in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I was interviewed by a friend who's a newspaper man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And, as usual, with newspaper people, they go after their own head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I said, "I'm going to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">What he put down that I'm going in Hungarian government business to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And even when the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> saw it, "Is she crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Well, what is this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">So that wasn't true and so this fiancé of mine thought that I am going from Communist business so he brought the chief of Communist's party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">Anyways, everything turned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">I didn't have to marry him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And that was wonderful, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">But in the meantime, it also turned out that he really wanted to save me and he was in love with someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">So it turned out alright that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">But I was there and I very fast got a wonderful job with Count Bernadotte** who brought in from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> the people they needed — people who go out and can speak <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and German and Hungarian and tell them stories about Swedish literature and culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">And that was a very wonderful thing to do because I had a key to the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Library</span> because they had the books were translated from Swedish to German so I could read Selma Lagerlof and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And I went and spoke for six months in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">I was very well paid, and it was also very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">The people I met in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who came out so sick, and the Swedes took care so beautifully of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">So that was the — I was three years in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . ** </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Count Folke Bernadotte After this job, I worked for a <span class="BUILDING">Scandinavian bank</span> and then I got frightened from the Soviets because everybody thought the Soviet going to overrun <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">Everybody was learning Russian in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Children were — when they were naughty, they said, “We give you to the Russians.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And I got frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I just wanted freedom, and it was wonderful and I loved <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">And Raoul wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet, and we didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">Nothing we knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And in the meantime, I brought my parents out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">And I wanted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and they wouldn't let me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">They said American was closed 12 years for Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">So <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> let me, and I went all alone all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and left my parents behind in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And Raoul was still not back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And we couldn't find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">We still didn't hear too much and still nobody was looking for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Actually, nobody cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">You never heard that word, “Raoul Wallenberg.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">Then I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and when I arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> my parents went to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">They lived there for three years, and when I became a citizen, then they finally came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And in 1960, I got married and the first person ever listened and believed the Wallenberg story was my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">Three weeks on our honeymoon, I told him the story and he was crying for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">We want that man back, but we still didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And then as you know, in the late 70s, Congressman Lantos” and his wife started to look for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">And that's how it all started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">And now my job 1s strictly to let the whole world know, especially children, that there is a hero <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Because we don't have any heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And we don't teach our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">And the Holocaust is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">Not just because the 6,000,000 Jews, because you know that Hitler killed 3,000,000 people who were priests, nuns, gypsies, blacks, and children in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">Three million, that's Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">Twenty three million young Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">That's Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">What's going on in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> is Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">We don't teach it to our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">We can't live like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">Children have to know what to fight for as Raoul Wallenberg did, because only the children without prejudice holding their hands, can make peace in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">And this 1s the only way, and that's what I am teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">I cannot bring Raoul out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I have no authority for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I let that let the diplomats handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">But he's teaching us to go on, ‘cause he taught me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Alright, I was in a family where nobody was ever prejudiced, but I learned that, like Raoul, always that there are no colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">There are no religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">There are two kind of people, the good and the bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">And if you're good, try to make the bad better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">And that's what children — and children listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">You'd be surprised how wonderful they are in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">And if I only reach three or four children in every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in every <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="1532">ANSWER:  Alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">I actually didn't go with him in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> many times with him because that he needed help there, the nurses and the sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And I was a hostess at the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> when these people came up to the <span class="DLF">door</span> to ask, "Please help." </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And then I took their picture and I went to the Ambassador and he would sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , as you know, and mostly I helped up in the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">Whatever I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">I was not a secretary, I was a gofer — “go for this” and “go for that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">And it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">But we always knew what Raoul did, and then on my own, I also collected some people and said, "Do you want to be saved? </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">Give me a picture." </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And then I took it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And sometime it come out very embarrassing because you don't remember the people you help, but they remember you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And this happened to me when I arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">If you are interested, I arrived to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I had something wrong with my tonsils, and I found a Hungarian doctor of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> up and near <span class="DLF">West End Avenue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">And one day, I'm sitting in his <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">His <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> was his <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , and people come up from his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">And I'm sitting there reading a book, and suddenly a fat gentlemen walked by and start screaming, "You saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">You saved my life." </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">And I looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">I forgot the war you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">Who thinks of the war?

ANSWER:  Well, you see, we worked for Raoul, 350 of us, and we all got working papers, and this is mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">And the working paper is written in two languages, in Hungarian and German, and thanks God, everything 1s signed by Raoul, himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">In Hungarian up there he signed and in the German, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">It says exactly that we are working under Department B or some of them work for Department A, plus the Swedish Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">And this we always carried with us the all time.

ANSWER:  Well, this 1s before Raoul arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">The Swedish Government, itself, gave out 800 of these passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">They are real Swedish passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">When the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> doesn’t have the hard cover, they give you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">And I was one of the lucky girls to get one, because I was evidently engaged to a Swedish gentleman and he said if the war wouldn’t have come, I would be his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">So I am Swedish and that’s my paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">And I traveled along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">All the visas on the back, you can see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">I traveled with this passport until I arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and then — “makuleras”®”” means “void.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">But I didn’t need it anymore.
