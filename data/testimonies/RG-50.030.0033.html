Degenhof decided who's going to go right, who's going to go left, the paper was not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It was just worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They took the paper, tear it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So I was with my mother and the kid, my wife and my brother, and it was most of my family who went to the left to the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Went in to the transport where the cattle transport they had, and they took us in to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="348">Now to tell you a story in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , I don't know how to start and I don't know how to end because it was like living through a whole life in that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">First thing, people one on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You couldn't stand straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You couldn't bend. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You couldn't sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It was just like one on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They took us 6 o'clock in the morning into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We were over there until about finished it loaded with all of us 2 hours maybe, more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Then they took us around back to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and over there we were waiting a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Across the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that passengers...Polish people, they could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They could ride, handle anything they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">When we stood each other, happened I was the lucky one...I was near a little <span class="DLF">window</span> , where was with wire closed around that people shouldn't be able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I looked through. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Most of the people what they did to us, they spit on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It happened one girl I know her. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She worked for a Jewish family from my...not the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived but <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I had my <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">When she saw me she said, "Oh, you are too here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And in a way, she started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But more than 90 percent of the passengers in the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they spit on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And so we start rolling...start rolling to went nobody knew where we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">In the middle of the night, was already about 18 hours in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we came to a side <span class="BUILDING">station</span> which they pointed out this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Stood over there for awhile and inside that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , with God's help, it was hot like <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> and that was almost the end of September where usually in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , end of September is nice and cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But at that time, just God helped them, not us. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">After about 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock start rolling again and we went through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> and all kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We came to a halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I looked out and I see a sign which didn't mean nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">The sign was <span

class="sentence" id="380">They went in, after about 2 hours they came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> empty. </span><span

were not supposed to...to see what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">That's why the pushed in the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="744">Now there was a question also or some did ask me, "Why did they have to cut the women's hair?" </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Was simple, simple answer to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Because they needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">What they did from that was to make saddles for the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Now if you cut off hair from a humanbeing, those hair it just like cutting off the feathers of a goose. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">If you cut the feather from a goose, when the

id="754">But if you cut the hair from a live person, if you put in the saddle, the saddle will not push down because that was...that's why they cut their hair off. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Just to be send back to German to the practice over there when they...where they make the saddles with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Now the...while working over there...did all

...excuse me the expression, the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> and all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">The hardest job and I think even harder working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> cutting women's hair was when the transport came in and you had to take out people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> .
