<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Martin Strauss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , on the 14th of July, 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family, when you were growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My family were German as far as we can research it back into the 1800s in the even before 1800. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We were all Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luthenbeck</span> , which is on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Main</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Uh...I know that my grandfather dealt in collecting fat to make soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We're going back into the 1800s. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And my father, named Leopold...uh...was born near, which 1s a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...uh...the <span class="REGION">area</span> is called. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And his father dealt in animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was a trader of animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father...uh...grew up and was sent into an apprenticeship... uh...at a merchant, and he became a merchant, eventually specializing in the sale of specialty oils. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He had a very interesting patent as a matter of fact, a patent where he...he was the sole distributor of that particular oil, made it possible to wash out lubricating oils which would spill from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">weaving looms</span> from bearings where it should lubricate, on to the fabric. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And that made secondhand fabric which the cloth manufacturers could not sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And his oil was the only oil in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that could be washed out, a washable lubricant. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And with it, he became extremely successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh...My father at age 19 lost his right leg in World War I, and because of that he had received one of the early <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> as a war veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">There was no anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was just a veteran and he very proudly all these years until the...1936-38 wore his...you know the iron cross on his lapel with great pride every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He wouldn't go out without his decorations because he was very, very German. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We were...like I am an American today with knowing what I have, we...our family, including myself, were very German. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We routed for the German team to win in the Olympics except maybe I'm jumping the gun a little bit, but it's interesting because in 1936 when Jesse Owens, the American sprinter, won several races. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I don't know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">At that time I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> said the black man is not a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They're more...or closer to animals and that's why he win and that's why he beat the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That gave me an awful shock even though I knew what anti-Semitism was but...uh...but the fact that Hitler declared the black people animals, even as a young kid already, I smelled something that was very distasteful, and I stopped routing for the Germans and when I stopped routing for the Americans...Germans, and I started routing for the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">An interesting psychological thing that happened in 36. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Well..uh...my
QUESTION:  Tell me...tell me.. tell me a little bit about your siblings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh...I had a sister, Marion, which is 8 years younger than I am....uh...born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We had a very comfortable income. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My father was one of the highest tax payers connected to you name it from the highest officials in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> down to...uh...being a...uh..executive...not executive director...on the executive board of the, which later came to haunt him because when he was arrested in 1939, he was arrested because his name was on this roster. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh...My sister, Marion, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> until...I am not totally sure about the date, but I think 1933, 1934, all Jews were expelled from <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We felt fairly comfortable in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> except, and that is interesting that the Jewish kids automatically sat together. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Don't ask me how we found each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Now we were...we were 6, 7, 8, 10 year olds. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The Jewish kids automatically felt they ought to protect themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They ought to sit together. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We always sit together. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And nobody told me who was Jewish and who was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But until 33, 34, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was fairly comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My father and my mother, like all Jewish parents, tried to shield the kids from the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh...We knew that certain things were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I know that and I remember distinctly where there were <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where said, Juden. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That means 'No Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Don't buy here.' </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I know there were often signs on <span class="DLF">windows</span> , bands on <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , 'Don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You Jews cannot buy here’. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There were discriminations, but our parents didn't want us kids to know or suffer from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So we bought our clothes some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">There were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish warehouses</span> , and we went and bought there. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But as times went on...until 1936, things were fairly under cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I mean they happened, but I know that more from historical facts than from personal experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But after the Olympics, and after Hitler put on a good show and because the world came to the Olympics in 36...after 36 things drastically changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Whether that was or the Nuremberg laws or whatever that was...you couldn't go to a dentist or any other doctor any more, and...uh...Jewish professionals were prohibited from practicing and from occupying certain... uh...occupations, certain...uh...trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We felt that 1t was becoming increasingly difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  How...how do you...how did the Nuremberg laws affect you personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was the Nuremberg law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss, add the name <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and my sister and my mother Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I remember one incident probably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I made a wrong turn of some kind and a policeman came and said, "Who are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I said, "Martin Strauss." </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he said, "Martin Israel Strauss." </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I said, "Yes, Sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The identification by saying <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , it said Jew Strauss. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Martin Jew Strauss. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That's what <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> said. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And of course I was guilty and I got a...a...a fine payable at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten away with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Uh...<span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> no longer admitted us, or we were thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So the Jewish community created <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , Jewish teachers, Jewish learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we found that very comfortable, us kids, simply because we were not harassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We played football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said, "We're not playing with any Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So a big fight erupted between the two football teams because the Jew Strauss was going to be on that team and they didn't want him on that team. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh...These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't bother you. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And that's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It's a system. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their occupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , thusly saving their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But my father and many others was quite wealthy, very wealthy indeed, and he said, "Hitler is going to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We're going to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Even if I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still some big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And he said, "We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will." </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And thusly we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters, followed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They had enough to eat, and they were living off the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and they didn't need much. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They said, "If Leopold Strauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either." </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I am ashamed and with great sorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having sent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Meaning they all perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There are 24, maybe 26. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We are not totally sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But 24 confirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too late, meaning 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh...We have confirmation of various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their children amounting to a minimum of 24 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They are all confirmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That's on my father's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart enough to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">From 36 to 39, which is a...uh...period of strengthening, growing anti- Semitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You could not own a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> who had permission to have an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> because (a) he had lost his leg in World War I. He was a decorated veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He had connections to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , and he was permitted to keep an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> , the only one 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of large proportions. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Everybody else had to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> , provided he stands up. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You could not sit down in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been taken away from each individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">A little chip at a time until the time came that you had to walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> because you couldn't walk on the side...<span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And...uh...a little chip at a time until you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But it happens step by step. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It isn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts on this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward hitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They were taught to be anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There were newspapers, the Sturmer, which 1s...1 am sure we still have records of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But many grownups took it as...as the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I...I still remember about Passover where they accused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You can edit it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for Pass...for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We laughed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But I am sure that many other people took it serious and accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky we...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">All ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but right now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh...We had our <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and we felt very comfortable because we were together and nobody harassed us when we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we studied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And there came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were rounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and shoved back into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That day I remember quite clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We lost many of our teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">One thing we lost our English teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two primary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The teachers were rounded up, put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and shoved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My teacher...uh...asked me to please go to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and fetch a little suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We were very close to the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">She was often at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which is the custom you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The teacher is the honored person in a...was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Any how...uh...I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">teacher's house</span> and got a little suitcase and threw it over a <span class="DLF">fence</span> to her prior to her getting on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I was <span class="DLF">school yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I fetched her little valise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and she had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Whatever it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation and...uh...she went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , became teacher in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was a miracle happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">How she got out I... don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">In any event, we lost a great deal of our teaching staff, and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after that was not any more because there were substitute teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They were lay...lay teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> didn't function like it should. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Uh...Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents shielded us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  You mentioned that before...you told me...why don't you tell me a little bit about your Bar Mitzvah, and your Jewish education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Uh...Of course, like most German Jews (coughing) Forgive me...uh...we came from a fairly <span class="BUILDING">orthodox house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Uh...When Hitler decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date may not be accurate...that no more kosher slaughtering was allowed, my mother had to make a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Either we eat non-kosher food or we don't eat meat, and of course, the decision was made 'no more meat in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And my mother would keep it absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">No meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So we became vegetarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Again one of those conditions steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is not available, but you have enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was just one more of those steps that...but with the proper resolve, my mother insisted that we do not break the laws of kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And the reason I remember this...because of my Bar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My father was still well known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and one of the biggest events of that Bar Mitzvah was that the menu included kosher meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Where do you get kosher meat? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You fly...not fly it, you truck it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I guess they...they didn't fly it...from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where there was kosher slaughtering, and they trucked the meat for the Bar Mitzvah at tremendous cost because of freezing refrigeration was almost not heard of in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That means it had to be slaughtered today, trucked tomorrow, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> to the Bar Mitzvah and a big...I'm not sure that the kosher meat wasn't more of an attraction than my Bar Mitzvah, but it was one of those memorable affairs where we had one up on the...uh...on the...let's day...Nazis who would not allow us to have kosher meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the Bar Mitzvah, of course, was well attended by all the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Many of our Gentile friends in the upper echelon would not attend, but would send gifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Again, one of those conditioning affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We understand you cannot attend for political reasons, but we accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Uh...Going back to 1939, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very difficult and one day, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is burning, and I didn't understand it because there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire engines</span> and people were standing around. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">No explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My father is looking for me, and my mother 1s looking for me and when I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they are delighted that I'm okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">What I didn't know is that Kristallnacht was about to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It didn't happen yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Uh...During Kristallnacht, of course, we are aware that all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , including ours, the <span class="BUILDING">Reform Synagogue</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox Synagogue</span> , were burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Some people who went in to save some of the scrolls were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Uh...Furniture came flying...during the night came flying out <span class="DLF">windows</span> , that the word Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Uh..People, not in uniform, but in civilian clothes...I remember that distinctly because normally the SR, SS were proud to wear the uniforms...but when when it came to looting <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and when it came to throwing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out and robbing <span class="BUILDING">households</span> and beating up people, most of these...as a matter of fact, I don't remember any incident where they were in...they were in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They were all in civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And...uh...we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and closed ourselves in, meaning we wouldn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span> for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We would just wait it out sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Well, at...at night around midnight, maybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Solid knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And three people, civilian clothes again, pressed pass my mother into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and said, "Where is Mr. Strauss?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="184">Mr. Strauss was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And we then knew that all <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> had broken loose because for one reason or another...and we, to this day, don't know, somebody called us on the telephone and shouted into the telephone, That means 'Run Away.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So some nut called us. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We didn't know how real this was, but we know something was up. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Uh...They go to my father and say, "You're coming with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="189">My father said, "Give me some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I have to put on my artificial leg." </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So they were standing around while my father strapped on his artificial leg, and my mother took me out of my little <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> on the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and said, "Up, under the <span class="DLF">rafters</span> you go." </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She had enough presence of mind to hide me. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I was 16 years old then. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I immediately went up to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> under the <span class="DLF">rafters</span> , kept very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Uh... They took my father, left my mother, left my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And he went to the <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">For 3 days we didn't know what was happening, what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We knew the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burning...<span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Fire engines standing by doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We then knew that this was an official sanctioned, government. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">It wasn't something that happened by coincident on a local level. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We knew then that it was a national scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I have to go back now a little bit and tell you about my father's business where we had something like 10 Gentile employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Of course, most of these, if not everyone of them were members of the SR...uh...of the party, and some SS which was the...like God. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Uh...They were all members of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Nevertheless, since my father was a good employer, paid tremendous wages...when I reflect upon the size of his operation, he had his own railroad...uh...uh...approach. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">You know where...where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank cars</span> would come to his <span class="DLF">yard</span> where the oil was pumped into his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> directly from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He had a substan...very substantial business, and he paid employees extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Being an amputee, of course, he had a driver, and the driver...uh...also being a party member, liked my father, was beholden to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Uh...He was a party man, but not a Jew hater because he had experienced a Jew who was decent to him, who paid him better than average wages. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And that was the salvation and maybe the reason we are still alive and we are here to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">After 3 days, which is the time that they assembled Jews either in the <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span> or down a <span class="DLF">river bank</span> because there was so many Jews that they couldn't have them all in...in <span class="BUILDING">city jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They drove them down into a <span class="DLF">river bank</span> where they could control that you couldn't run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> was water. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was two <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and they...they were hemmed in there prior to transportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Back to the chauffeur, the driver of my father's, he went to the <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span> and said, "I need to extract the Jew Strauss." </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I don't know whether you know German mentality...uh...but in my opinion, there is a superior and there is a follower, and there is nothing in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And if a superior, an officer, says, "I want the Jew Strauss," and what was the life of a Jew. "</span><span class="sentence" id="220">I want him," and he took him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He was able to extract my father from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and bring him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I will never...never ever, as long as I live, forget my father's face after he came out of 3...only 3 days of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We're talking about people who have been in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">My father after 3 days had become a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">His face...he was unshaven, of course, and that added to...to the impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Well, the chauffeur took him, brought him to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he said, "Mr. Strauss, it's time to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">You have a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Try and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I'll take you to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we'll see what we can do." </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Because the chauffeur had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and he kept the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So for a number of days, we...the kids...my daughter...my sister and myself, were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And my mother and my father went out, looked for visas to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That's very interesting because the Jews were hunting for visas, and the Nazis were hunting for Jews, so unless they were recognized as Jews, they could travel on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> or go to the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> and stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> and look for visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we said, "We will go anywhere in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Just let us get out." </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There was, of course, no way to find out what brothers and sisters were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Telephones were disrupted, disconnected, were listened too. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We couldn't make any calls that amounted to anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And we decided we will go anywhere where we can get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But no visas were to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Who wanted us? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The Swiss didn't want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Europeans didn't want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="243"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ...and I bow my head in shame...history will show that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had 8,000 visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939, but not one single, extra visa was ever issued to accommodate any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And I don't have to go into the history of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> arriving to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and were turned back where most of the people lost their lives after they were turned away from the <span class="REGION">American shores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">No visas for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">No visas anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">The only opportunities were either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , which you could buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">For marks, you could buy visas for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and many people went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">History will show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Then there was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">A limited amount of visas on the British mandate were available. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And then there was <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and we were waiting for either one of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or England visas to give us permission to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And the Israel visa came first. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Two days later, the England visa came, but fate wanted us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Uh...the chauffeur took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , dumped us into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , got us to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where, at the <span class="DLF">border line</span> , the Germans knowing we had the passports, knowing that we were immigrating took us apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But taking us apart, I mean literally. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They took my father's wooden leg off and searched it for money, contraband. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But we knew better than that, because by that time we already had learned our lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Uh...They took and stripped my mother, totally naked, and checked in <span class="NPIP">places</span> you wouldn't dream of checking, and they took my little sister who at that time was an 8 year old kid, and stripped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I don't know exactly how much they checked her, but I know my mother told me that she was totally and utterly checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And then they put us back together again, our luggage and so forth, and we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">From <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , we got to then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And, of course,...uh...that shaped my life and my attitude and my...my total thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We did not know what happened to our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The fact that they perished we only found out after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My father and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We looked up records and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Uh...I don't know whether the following is relevant, but it is interesting because I had changed in my total attitude in life, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I became so aware of the fact...we're talking about 1940, 41, 42...there were hundreds and thousands of refugees trying to get out of Europe, trying to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Old people that had been...had escaped, especially after the war ended in 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There were thousands of Jews trying to leave Europe and get to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The British mandate blocked <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I became a volunteer, a social worker, a photographer, a radio operator...you name it, trying to help in bringing in illegal immigrants in addition to the fabulous training and schooling that I got in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And in 1947, I got caught by the British again, and for 3 months I went into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span> called, and...uh...I stayed there because I was a trouble maker, and they told me, "We will either take you to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> or you can go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or you can go anywhere you want, but we will not let you back into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So...uh...as fate would have it, I had an uncle on my mother's side in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who gave us a visa, and the German quota was totally unused. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And here I end again as a refugee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , welcomed with open arms, immediately found a job, and again I became not only a...a fairly successful businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">In other words, I earned a lot more than I ever thought and hoped I would earn. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I become again a social worker and...uh...1 am amongst other things, Chairman of the Russian Resettlement Committee of the Jewish Social Services agency here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and I have been active there for 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And it's a privilege to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because I am...and this is what I, Iam a better American or as good as an <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">May they rest in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We're Germans because we had the opportunity to flourish. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We had the opportunity to become citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And this is what happened to me in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I appreciate what this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 's done for and I appreciate the freedom and the freedom of the press which was really the...the most devastating vehicle with which Hitler was able to brainwash the German population. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">You see it in print, you believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It's...it's...uh...hard to define, hard to understand, but I think it was propaganda machine was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> to convince the Germans to do what they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Did your family come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">My...my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">This is another... Can I interrupt for a second here. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">An interesting of the entire story was the fact that my father found it very difficult temperature heat-wise, mentality-wise to make it in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he became very, very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We had...we literally sold some of the belongings from my father to buy a ticket back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And he went in 1950 back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He said, "I have a lot...lot that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> owes me." </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And he had documentation like any...uh...good businessman, he had certain records and...uh...I have for instance the penalty...the photograph of the penalties that were imposed when Rath was killed by Grynzspan...uh...and there was a substantial penalty imposed on the Jewish people in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Everybody had to pay 20 percent of whatever he owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="294"><span class="BUILDING">House</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> ...uh...not only cash, but 20 percent of what you own as payable as a penalty to the German government because the Ambassador in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was killed by Grynzspan. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He had those papers and he went back and he said, "Not only do you people owe me the pension that you promised me when I lost...and I gave my leg for the <span class="REGION">Fatherland</span> ...uh..., I think I'm entitled to my pensions and...uh...we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And I believe and a little more research has to be done, that the law of restitution was created after my father went back and demanded and had a lawyer pursue the restitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Uh...He went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He passed away in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my mother passed away in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My mother followed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Uh...My sister stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Then she joined me in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because I didn't want to live alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I'm blessed with two lovely kids and grandsons, and it's been a very good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  Let me just ask a couple more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Back...uh...back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , when you were growing up and becoming...you were still in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a regular <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">An interesting thing happened during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Uh...In <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , there was a class given by some German educator who was teaching the kids how to recognize Jewish features. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Of course, that was all a bunch of garbage, but somehow or other darker hair and...and bigger noise and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Anyhow, this is...I remember this vividly...uh...I was in a German class and he called me up and says, "Strauss, Come up front." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">He did not know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And I came up front and he said, "This man even though he is not Jewish has very Jewish features." </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And he pointed to my noise and my chin and my...etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I turned around to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I said, "I'm sorry to contradict you Sir, but your diagnosis of me being a Jew is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Iam a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he was terribly embarrassed in front of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I was taken out of the class immediately because a Jew wasn't supposed to attend that class in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But that was another one of those little steps that...uh...for a 14, 15 year old kid, it's embarrassing, but it doesn't really tell you that...uh...some day I'm out to kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So in the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> until, I would say, 1933, 1934, we were fairly well tolerated,...uh...but as I said before, some how or other, the Jewish kids always sat together. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And...uh...I think I had one Gentile friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The rest were all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">All the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Maybe it's a defense mechanism. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Maybe it's distinctively some how...uh...and we always helped each other.</span></p>
