<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Please tell us your full name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Eve Rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My maiden name was Wagszul. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowel</span> , spelled K - O - W - E- Lon the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> , very close to the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My childhood as I remember was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My father was a very, very religious man, came from a poor family but they were all educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">They were rabbis, schokhets (ritual slaughterers) and scholars. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother was not an educated woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She came from a family from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Her father, my grandfather, was a very clever man. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">As a Jew he could never own any <span class="REGION">land</span> , but because he was a very good businessman, he leased <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and then they would cut them up for lumber. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And he was quite successful, so my mom's family was comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I wouldn't say rich because it would mean a lot, but they were very comfortable, so they insisted that the children, us, that we all went to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They made sure that we didn't have any accents, that we didn't speak Jewish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because if you had an accent you couldn't get into a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">This sometimes did not go over too well with my dad because he was religious, but he could see with anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that it might be to our benefits. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I was the youngest of two sisters and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My brother left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> right after his bar mitzvah and I barely remembered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I was very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I think I was like five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And pretty soon after enjoying a good childhood with even help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...you know, we always had a maid, a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Her name was Katja. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I can still remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">and my dad I must say was a lawyer but because he could, as a Jew he couldn't pass the Polish bar 01:03: he became an advocate for the Polish lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It means he would hang around the <span class="BUILDING">Polish court</span> , give them advice, but he could never enter, could never be in front of the judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But he had plenty of business within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ...fourteen thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And we were pretty comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">my grandfather bought us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">One of my sisters...my mom played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">One of my sisters played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">You know, I was never much...I played but I wasn't as talented as my sister, and then the Russians came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and of course things changed and I don't remember much because things didn't change for us economically, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My father was very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He was afraid that the Russians knowingly would send us probably to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> because everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> knew that we were Zionists, especially my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But little did we knew that the Russians started to move back because the Germans came in, and this is when my tragedy started. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We were put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where life was pretty pretty horrible and soon after they divided like the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and for some reason we ended up in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because my father wanted to be with his mother, with my grandmother and when the first order was to get the Jews out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they didn't tell us they were going to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They told us they were going to take the men to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and the women were going to go to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  What was the life like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  It was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There wasn't enough food but I remember because of my grandfather's connection, because he lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , you know, and a lot of people worked for him, he would constantly send a non-Jewish peasant over with food, but there came a time where they wouldn't let him through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were practically starved and there were no facilities to wash, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Sometimes they would cut off the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Things were pretty bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">01:06: A lot of people, the older people started to die because there was no doctors around. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The doctors were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> earlier and we knew that sooner or later they're going to either kill us or take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , the younger people, and that one night that I remember so well, we were told to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">For some reason my father wouldn't leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I don't remember why I was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because my mother and my sisters were not and they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They broke down the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My father had a talis (prayershawl) on. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And they killed him in front of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I really don't remember what went what went through my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I didn't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I didn't scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I just ran around the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I got <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56"><span class="NPIP">Outside</span> there were people running and there were several of us young girls and some of the German soldiers that surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> let us go through and I remember one of them gave us a battery, light. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I don't know...maybe he meant for us just to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was dark and to try to save ourselves and this was like the first time that I realized 01:08: that maybe not all of them are bad, because he he could have killed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I think there were three or four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">When I think of that moment I can't understand that I didn't take time to make sure that my father is indeed dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They could have shot him and he could have been alive and suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I just cannot explain that and I have a lot of guilt about it and to this day I think about it and the only explanation that I could give you and I have given maybe to myself is that the will of surviving was so strong that I couldn't think of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I wanted to live for a better world or to tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was always afraid that all the suffering would be forgotten and there's nobody going to be there to tell the story, and I started to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I ran through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Some people, peasants, would would give us bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I don't realize that they knew we were Jews, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Some of them had a hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They worked in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and there were people wandering around. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">01:10: Well some of them probably didn't even know about the political situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where they wouldn't give us any bread or any water and they would say, you're probably Jews and you're wandering around. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we tried to stay away from better looking <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , worrying that those people were better educated and they might recognize us. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I lost track of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I didn't know where I was at times, you know...what's going to happen to us and there were times that I really didn't want to live because we didn't know what tomorrow's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You know, some people seem kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Some people would point out to you and say, if you don't get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we're going to tell the Germans and they're going to come and get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And it didn't take long before we were arrested, and we were taken to some...the difference between a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> wasn't much really, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> kind of kept you a couple of days and they weren't as well organized as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , so it was very easy to walk out and to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I remember walking away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> with some...at that time I called him older man because I was like fourteen or fourteen and a half years old, and they told us that not too far there's some religious installation. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It's a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and they are helping a lot of people and I walked in to this...1t didn't...to me it looked like a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> because in in the front of this big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...1t wasn't actually a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but there was a like a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , a big <span class="DLF">cemetery plot</span> and then we noticed nuns dressed in habits 01:12: and we waited until not too many people were around. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There were like four of us I believe, and we walked in and we told them that we needed help, that we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and they asked us if we were Jews and we told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I mean at that point there was no place of hiding and I had a feeling that if nuns are not going to help us, you know, then there's no sense going on, and they told us they were crowded, that they had a lot of infants. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They had a lot of sick people and they indeed did, but this Mother Superior that I called it... Theresa was her name, Mother Theresa. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">By the way, they were Carmelites, and there were a lot of Volksdeutsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You know what a Volksdeutsche is? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The mother can be Polish and the father can be German. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">A lot of them were mixed, and they took us in and they told us that we had to be very quiet and it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where they put us and sometimes we did chores for them and they gave us some food and they really didn't know how long we could stay because they were constantly being watched by neighbors, you know, and sometimes they could tell them stories so they could explain what was going on but most of the time they didn't see any of the police, any of the German police and we stayed there for several months and slowly they tried to explain to us that things are getting very bad and they are threatened they would kill them if they would find out how many Jews they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They had quite a few later on we found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We heard the babies cry at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">01:14: We saw corpses being taken out of very old people and finally they told us that we have to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did they give you anything while you were there, any...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, they gave us cross and a prayer book. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They tried very much to convert us and some of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I was kind of scared, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I told them that I believe in my God, that I'm Jewish and I was scared that my Jewish...you know, I was a child, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I told them in my own words that if I accept your religion my God's going to punish me and I was scared to do it and I said I respect your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I would always respect it and if it can save my life I'll wear your cross and I'll treasure that prayer book that I still have and I want the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I memorized all the prayers and when we parted they gave me a peasant blouse to wear so I wouldn't look suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I would look like a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And this was a very sad time to part with them because you had like a little security and I remember feeling good. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They would take us into the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> to pray, you know, and they would make us kneel and it just felt good after the prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You know, I kept saying to myself, God, there's nobody Jewish to pray with me, therefore I have to pray with them and when we parted it was very sad and it was like dying 01:16: and I even told...there was one nun that took a special liking to me and every time she looked at me she would cry and she wanted me so much to stay there because she kept saying that I looked less Jewish than the others and there's really no such thing as looking Jewish, but because I was a red-head and the Germans believed that every Jew has dark hair and a big nose and dark complexion...1t wasn't, 1t wasn't so at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My mom had very fair complexion and I was always very fair, and it was very hard for this nun to part with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">She wanted me to stay but they were afraid and they let us go and this is how I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Pretty soon they rounded us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="106"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> was in the beginning to me...I can't say salvation but it was like a relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Like I didn't have to run anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I knew it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I saw a pile of dead people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I saw conditions and I heard screams but in the beginning I was kind of happy because I knew that tonight I can stay here, that I don't have to run through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because there's no one that extended a hand anymore like the nuns did. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">By the way, I'll go back to the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They were very, very good to me, to us and I want you all to know that they risked their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They didn't have much food and they shared it with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My... 01:18
QUESTION:  How did you get from the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  We were just wandering around...
QUESTION:  In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I really didn't know where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">If you asked me where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> was, near what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">If you saw a crowd of people you kind of turned around because you were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Everyone looked suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">After leaving the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> we weren't dirty because we always had some water facilities you know to wash but when they they rounded us up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> where they took people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> was, turned out to be later on a pretty horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, especially for a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I...at one point I didn't know that they had younger children than me but later on I found out that they had a lot of infants and nobody could approach that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> because apparently they would kill the infants and make lamp shades out of baby skins or soap from baby fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We could smell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We heard sometimes screams but we never saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Then there was another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> that where the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were always covered with chalk and sometimes we would come back from hard work...we would dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> or whatever they would 01:20: ask us to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">By the way, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had a lot of Russian prisoners and they had high officers that lived separated from everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They were treated much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They would interrogate them, maybe get some secrets from them, because I noticed that they were bringing them food and a couple of times they sent us to clean their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they had given us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">This is when I realized that they had some important Russian officers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Then one day, and this is a a very difficult thing for me to talk, but it's history. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were asking a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">What is in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">What 1s in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the chalk kind of interested me because sometimes I would hear screams and I would see German soldiers taking women there, women that were maybe at that time maybe in their twenties or maybe older. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They were developed a lot better. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They were pretty women and apparently they made some medical experiments, because through one <span class="DLF">window</span> we peeked and we saw some men naked in big tubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They were metal tubs, with ice and they would freeze them to a certain temperature and they would let the women undress and I guess they wanted to see the sexual reaction and this was horrible to watch and pretty soon it was the turn for us. (</span><span class="sentence" id="139">Pause) (Crying) This is when you . (</span><span class="sentence" id="140">Pause) And if you didn't do what they wanted you to do, you'll be beaten up something terrible, or you were put under cold showers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="141">Crying) Now I remember the Red Cross at 01:23: one time came and we were moved to a different <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then we heard rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">A lot of the...there were a lot of Poles, there weren't only Jews...there were some Poles, political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There were even some Germans that were political opponents and we heard rumors that they were going to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we had ovens. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There were ovens in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> but I never got to see them, and we heard screams but we never got to see them, but apparently the ovens weren't big enough...
QUESTION:  Before we move on, let me...can we go back a little bit to what your experiences that you were talking about at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , what they did? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Could you be a little...tell us a little more detail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  I think it was...I think they just wanted to see the men suffer and us suffer but you know, when we saw the women that, you know, when a fourteen or fifteen year old girl that doesn't have to eat, it's rather ugly. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Her head shaven looks...some of the women were rather, you know, developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You know, they were older. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I don't even remember having any breasts, you know, and when you saw what they did...they threw them, you know, on top of the men and they wanted to see the reaction and they actually tried to force the man to have sex with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  What was your experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Tell what they asked you to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  They asked us to do the similar thing, but most of the time the men were like dead and it was just a horrible thing 01:25: doing that, and the screams and and I remember I asked to be killed. (</span><span class="sentence" id="154">Crying) (Pause) I just couldn't go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They they stopped it and this was apparently...later on we found out that it was a group of doctors were conducting this experiment for their own selfish maybe... I really can't explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I read a book about it, that they were abnormal people, that they just got a kick seeing people suffer like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Pretty soon when we heard rumors that we're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we decided that no matter what, we're not going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We're going to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or we're going to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We're going to kill ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We didn't have any weapons and we thought maybe we'll get some poison, you know, and you couldn't really talk, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You would gather doing work and you would...somebody would say something, but then one night indeed they took us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> supposedly was taking us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And at one point they told us when we tell you to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you must do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">If not, you're going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You don't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And we jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">You can still see a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , but I...they picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It wasn't too bad, and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ...there was so much confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">There were a lot of people...there were hundreds of people, and they put us on a transport of forced labor that was going into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I don't know if you're familiar with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They would take a lot of young people...very seldom Jews because Jews were already rounded up and and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but there were a lot of Russian, Ukrainians and Polish young people and they forced them to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so they could work on their <span class="DLF">fields</span> , because the German soldiers were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They were fighting the war, so that's how I got into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , with a transport of maybe three hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">On that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> only one person knew that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">01:28: A Ukrainian girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">To this day she lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and we actually didn't know where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is going to take us but she whispered to me, as long as I can I'm going to help you and I'll never tell anyone that you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and we ended up on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranding</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">This was pretty close to the war end. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We already heard rumors that, you know, the Americans are getting closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Life on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> wasn't very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">There wasn't enough food and the farmers were not very nice to us and they were very suspicious of me because most of them were indeed farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I wasn't so as a result they would look at my hands and they would say, oh, you must be some Italian, noble girl or something because your hands don't look like our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I couldn't milk a cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I couldn't do a lot of things that they did, but it was still better than being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but I was very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I knew that the war would come to an end and I didn't know how I was going to get out of this group of Poles, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">How would I join with the liberation forces? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">This was my biggest concern, and this friend of mine, Natshtca (ph)...the only one that knew I was Jewish...she said, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It's going to work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I remember when we heard over the radio that they liberated a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Stranding was maybe like a hundred miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> and the farmer got very scared, you know, because he mistreated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You know, he would beat us once in a while, and he wanted to know if we want to go, and we didn't know where to go so we asked him if he would give us a ride to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">He give us a ride to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borgenberg</span> (ph), which was a tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we went to the police, this German police, and we asked him where the Americans are. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And they didn't tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They were still about 01:31: fifty miles, and pretty soon this Colonel McMann...the one that I showed you the obituary...he liberated a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he made an announcement on the radio, so if you have...if you know where Jewish people are, if they're hiding, please come forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And they sent out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American cars</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> to get us and they put us in <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And this is when they started to interview us, and you know, we were so scared that I was afraid even to speak to Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I remember the first interview was a colonel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He was asking me questions and I didn't trust him, but it took a while for me to gain confidence in them, and we told them about my family and the first concern was do I have somebody living, and I knew...I pretty much gave up on my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I knew that if they would be alive, I would have...they would have found me or something, but I knew that my brother's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that he probably is either in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or hiding somewhere else and the American Red Cross found out that he was fighting with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and it took him a while to find me because he couldn't get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In the meantime they were questioning me about my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I knew names but I didn't...couldn't tell them where they lived or how they lived and there was one 01:33: American doctor that took a special interest and showed me a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They gave us some medication to kind of relax us. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">There was a group of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Must have been a couple of hundred Jewish kids, and they showed us a movie of these sights and they asked us, they said if there is a name...you know, they showed us <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> with names...if there's a name that makes any sense to you, and I saw a name Friedman, and I said I think I had a cousin by the name of Friedman and they asked me what he did and I really didn't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I told them that I think he came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he became a watchmaker and he put it all with my name and what I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He put an ad in the American Jewish Journal or whatever...it's a paper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ...and a cousin of my grandfather read it and they sent a telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because the other cousin's son, the man that married me, was with the American forces near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and within a couple of weeks he came to see me and by then, you know, I had gained weight and they had given me some clothes and this is the picture...
QUESTION:  Where were you living then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranding</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">German home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">This was not a very pleasant story in the beginning because when the Burgermeister brought me there with the Jewish survivors, it became like the head of the Jewish kids to help us out, came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and told them the story that she's liberated now. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">She has no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">She says I can't accept her. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">She's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And she said my husband is a Nazi and that's why he's in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , so I did not want to live with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And then we found out that the doctor, Doctor Edlbacher, I remember his name well he was not a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He joined the Nazi party because he was a hunter and he couldn't get a license. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And that night he was freed, and indeed they gave me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They tried to be very nice and they came with flowers, and I knew it was temporary because my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> did everything to try to bring me over. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">In the meantime my brother came, but things were so bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 01:36: that he knew that I would have to wait a long time to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because there were just too many people and the British were not willing to do it, so pretty soon I got a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and I came on a military small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , Marina Fletcher and I have the telegram that was sent to me and I hope the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> can have them, or wants them. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So my story, my very sad story had a good ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I felt sad that I came alone, that I was pretty much sure that they were dead because I went through a lot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> looking for for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I thought maybe I'll find a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Maybe I find my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I knew about my father, but indeed to this day nobody's alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Where did you go when you first came to...arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , to my grandmother's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They were very good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">She was so overwhelmed with all this, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">She didn't know what to do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">She lived at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">She had three educated children, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Her daughter was married to a doctor and two sons were fairly successful businessmen and they really wanted me to live with them, but she wouldn't let me go and it was difficult for me to stay with her because I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> and when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I had to speak Yiddish with her because that was the only language she knew and I felt like I really wanted to learn the language and all this time I corresponded with my husband-to-be. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know, and he wrote to me and he wanted very much for me to wait for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And he still remained there for almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And finally he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in November '46 and we were married pretty soon after. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Had a beautiful family. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I have three beautiful children but 01:39: tragedy struck and my husband died of a sudden heart attack at the age of forty-seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">He did a lot for us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He helped with the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">He helped me an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">He's the one that made all the connections with relatives to sponsor me because the Polish quota was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It...I don't know how they managed to send me on the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military boat</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="244">Pause)
QUESTION:  Now you're in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">What were your feelings about...about living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , adapting to American ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  I loved this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I'm very grateful for accepting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I still have a lot of guilt as to my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Sometimes I question why did I survive and they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">This somehow never leaves it. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You try to be involved with a lot of good causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I try to tell my stories because I feel that you cannot really condemn a nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I feel that if 1t wouldn't be for some good Germans that let us through the <span class="DLF">lines</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I wouldn't be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I feel that if it wouldn't be for the nuns that risked their lives to help us, we wouldn't be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I feel that every survivor has a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Some people are very bitter in that they don't want to remember good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I had spoken to a lot of friends that resent me even telling the story about the nuns because they feel why weren't there more nuns, but I, I believe that we have to appreciate even if there was a little good in them we should appreciate it, and I'll remember all those things that were done for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I'll remember to the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">There were a lot of righteous people in this world and I hope that God blesses them and that they get rewarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I know a lot of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">My girlfriend, the one that's in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , she is not young and she's ill and we try very much to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">To this day I'm in touch with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It would have been very easy for her to point me out as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">She probably would have gotten paid, but she didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And stories like that go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">This is why I feel that there's still a lot of good in mankind, and maybe...I'm thinking now about the Germanies being united and I have mixed feelings, but this is a new generation and let's hope that there's going to be a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">01:43:
QUESTION:  Are there any other things that you would like to add about your experiences that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  (Sigh) Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">You know, sometimes my mind goes blank because I'm trying so hard to move away from my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But if if there 1s something that you want me that I started and I wandered off, I would be glad to tell you....you mean experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or...
QUESTION:  Experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that you can relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Well, there were inhuman conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There were even inhuman behavior among Jews, sometimes because you were angry, because you were hungry and because you really couldn't explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , sharing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> with a French girl that talked very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">She didn't want to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">She didn't want to talk to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">She was quite sickly, and she just talked about her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">She always cried about her family, and I remember something that I did that to this day I find very hard to explain why I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">She wouldn't eat, and you know we had so little to eat, and somehow there was a piece of bread next to her and she didn't eat, and I ate that piece of bread and the next day she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">She didn't live through the night, and I feel like maybe because I ate her bread, she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And this just brought on more guilt and sometimes you wonder why, why did I have to live in circumstances to see such horrible things. (</span><span class="sentence" id="282">Sigh) This girl I recognized in a photograph that was given to me close to liberation by a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I don't know if they took the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I really don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  What kind of work did you do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  Oh they would make us dig ditches, clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Sometimes take stones and move them near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Sometimes we cleaned <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where...they had a lot of Russian prisoners and most of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that we cleaned were officers', as I told you, and they would sometimes give us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And most of the time we witnessed some horrible experience that I described to you, and some of the things they wouldn't let us see like the babies, you know, were ...they made skin out of 01:47: baby skin or lamp shades out of baby skin or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We were never...I could never...even if I could see it I don't think I could look at it, but this was done in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  What were the conditions in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Were the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Well, you know, as I told you when I got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was like to me it was better than living in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You know, there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I remember seeing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and I hadn't seen a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for a long time and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> looked so good to me and so clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Actually it wasn't clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The food was pretty bad but you ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You know, sometimes dish water tasted like good soup because you were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You were young and sometimes you saw prisoners hungry eating dead prisoners' flesh and it's terrible to go back and and remember it and sometimes I can't believe the things that I saw and I think it's either I read a story or it's imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And it's took me a long time to overcome dreams or horrible thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was in therapy when I first came over just to be able to function, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was hard for me to smile. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was hard for me to listen to music sometimes, especially music that had a marching...you know, I would just get frantic or sometimes even faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I used to have horrible dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">You know, the vision of my father with the talis (ph)...vision of a lot of dead people piled up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I had to work very hard to overcome it (crying). </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It took me years to be able to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">When there was a documentary on television I would round up the kids and put them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and my late husband would get angry at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">He felt that they should see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">For some reason I didn't want them to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I couldn't really explain why. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I wanted the world to know what Hitler did, but 01:50: I wasn't sure how it was going to affect young children and I always was afraid that they might see movies of my experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I feel this to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It was a...I couldn't quite understand what they were doing and it was a frightening thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">You know, it was something that I really couldn't even explain to the doctor. (</span><span class="sentence" id="315">Pause) A lot of people suggest that...my doctor suggested that I should write a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There's many books written on the Holocaust and what I experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know if I'm strong enough to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The years that I have remaining I want to see...my kids are pretty grown. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I have my youngest 1s in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and I hope he succeeds, and I am just so afraid of getting weaker, of losing my mind and you know, this this is my fear because some of those things are pretty horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I never thought that a human being could live through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">There was a time where I was wondering if there was really a God, and I questioned a lot of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I didn't want my kids to know about it, so I did make sure that my kids had a religious education. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They were all bar mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But I always questioned and when I lost my husband I had a lot of conversations with God, but you never get an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But I still feel that there is something good that's going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It has to because we've been through so much horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Now with this situation in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> , God protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We don't know what's going to happen, but I refuse to believe that if there is really a God, that he's going to let 1t happen because there was so much suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">People suffer from illness in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">There's a lot of suffering in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There's so much good that still can be accomplished, and I hope that we all live to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I want to thank you for the opportunity to talk maybe more than I ever did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You forgive me for my emotions.</span></p>
