QUESTION:  Could you introduce yourself and tell us a little about yourself please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I’m tra — Tracy Strong, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> , <span class="REGION">Washington</span> , September 4", 1915, and grew up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> in 1910 to join the <span class="BUILDING">Seattle YMCA</span> as a Boys’ Worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">So we spent the first 12 years at — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> on <span class="DLF">Queen Anne Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Eventually moved up on the <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> in Queen Anne Hill and built a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looking out over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Union</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My bra — I have a older brother Robbins, and a younger sister Ruth, and we enjoyed a very pleasant gro — time at growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> ; it wasn’t quite as crowded as it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we built is — in fact, I just heard from the lady who lives there, she bought it from my father in 1923, and has lived in it ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> remained the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We had a normal childhood, my father was always off toa <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">YMCA camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And summers we’d join him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so we spent a very pleasant time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Then in 1923 my June 11, 2009 father was appointed to the Boys’ Work secretary for the world’s YMCA in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , so the family all packed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I was five, my sister was seven or eight, and my brother was 10 or 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my father indicated that if we’re going to work in a world’s organization, he should see something of the Orient. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So we sailed out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> in November 1923 on the — one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">princess ships</span> , and went, actually, practically all the way around the world in six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">As I think back on that, must — and have traveled with my own children, here were three young children and my mother taking care of us all the way around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We went first to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , and got there just after the big earthquake in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> in 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Then M-Moncton(ph), <span class="REGION">Manchuria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Then around through <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , up through the <span class="DLF">Suez Canal</span> , went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and eventually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> , an-and arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in April 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Which was quite a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So we settled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , which was then a much smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that it is now, but also a very international town, because a lot of international organizations were there, including the international Red Cross, and then many of the other youth-serving or people- serving organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Oh, we started out in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , across the <span class="DLF">street</span> [indecipherable] where we had to learn French 1n a hurry if we wanted to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We children picked up June 11, 2009 French very quickly, my folks never did, so we asked them not to speak French when we were, cause their accent was so poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Anyway, they went there, went to <span class="BUILDING">international school</span> for a year or so, and eventually came back to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for two ye — my father thought I should learn English, so I came back for two years to a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bainbridge Islands</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Then I was 16, at which time I felt I was a little too young for <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and as he and my mother were traveling a great deal for the y — world’s YMCA, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Deutsche Jugend — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jugendhof</span> , which was 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And if you remember your history well, that was the time that Hitler came to power, in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So I went through that whole time of the change in regime and cha — and heard Hitler speak twice, big rallies. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And then at the end of the year, went back to <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> — <span class="BUILDING">Oberlin College</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , where I spent four years and got my bachelor’s degree, 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">At that time I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to do, a chance of working in the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> , or in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">Yale Divinity School</span> for three years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">In 19 grad — got my da— my master’s degree in divinity and it was in 1940, first war had already started in Europe, and my father had headed up the war — war prisoner’s aid of the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> , which was approved in the Geneva Convention, that international Red Cross took care of the physical problems of the prisoners on ev-every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> took care of their June 11, 2009 spiritual and intellectual problems, physical problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So, my father was the head of this organization, but he — with <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , although — and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> was still open then. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">1940, of course, the — <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">In just a few weeks, blitzkrieg [indecipherable] Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I did —
QUESTION:  When did — did you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  I went back to — actually to ge — headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , then across <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> where we got — just at the time <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had fallen, so everything was closed down, so we were stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> for several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And then eventually the group went across <span class="REGION">southern France</span> and up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhone Valley</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And went originally to work with the European Student Relief fund, which was an organization made up of the three student serving organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The World Student Christian Federation, the Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The Pax Romana, the Catholics, NISS, a neutral organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And our job was to do for stu — university students what the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> was doing for the general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So we singled out students in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I did go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about six months, to work in the prisoner of war camp, and visited <span class="BUILDING">Stalag 16</span> , I think it was, and 17, one section of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The ma — most of the prisoners were either French or British, Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">A few ru — quite a few Russians eventually, which now June 11, 2009 because <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> did not sign the Geneva Convention, we could not get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to visit them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  What were some of your activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with the prisoners of war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Mainly with the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> and the — and the European Student Relief Fund, the ESRF, it’s called, for them I was ju — identify students, and try and get books, material to them, so they continue their studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">See, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , particularly the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">officers’ camps</span> , the officers were not allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They had nothing to do except organize activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> brought in books, sporting material, violins, anything to keep them occupied during their imprisonment. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I’d go the — there were about, I suppose, 15 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that I visited off and on in the fall of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Eventually — course, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> wasn’t in the war yet, but in 1941 I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The Germans would not let me go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> any more, they thought I had helped a prisoner escape, which was the last thing in the world I would have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So the Germans went and closed the camps to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So —
QUESTION:  So you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  So I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="58">interruption] So I went in the — must have been about March I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , where <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were for the ASRF, and — and by this time there were camps set up in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">See, when the Germans took <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , everybody in <span class="REGION">northern France</span> went to the south, June 11, 2009 to get away the rapid advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The Germans kind of overran everybody, but then, as you recall, it divided <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into occupied and unoccupied France, with the occupied being <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The Vichy government was set up in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> under General Pétain, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laval</span> , which put the Germans very much in control. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But at least they didn’t — were not interfering in southern — in oro — unoccupied France.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Tell me, who sent you to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Did Donald Lowrie?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  No, Donald Lowrie was the head of the YMCA organization in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  He was based where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  He was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> [indecipherable] and — and the — our — our student organization worked with the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> , or under the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> because they had access to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  So did he ask you do come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> to —
ANSWER:  Well, it wasn’t so much his asking, he — he was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and we were — and the — my or — organization, the European Student Relief Fund wanted somebody to coordinate things for students only, in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , so I — and the entry was through the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So I went, being sent by the European Student Relief Fund, be working with the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">June 11, 2009
QUESTION:  You s — mentioned traveling with Everett Melby, was he part of the European Student Relief Fund too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Yes, he was one of the secretaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Who was person who decided what your mission was? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Was there someone above you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Yes, there is. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">A-André de Bionay was the head of the organization, was hired by the three religious groups, or student groups that had formed the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So I was responsible to him, but my activities were pretty much up to me, what I could do with — to help students in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Who funded you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  The European Student Relief Fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Because you seem to have a lot of tra — you seemed to travel a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That was part of my job, to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and help set up the [indecipherable] or the bibliothéques, in the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  And your specific mission was intellectual support, and something else too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Spiritual, phy — whatever physical support we could give. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know, I’m sure mainly, my main job was to identify students and see what we could do to either get them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or to get them material to study with. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Wasn’t too happy with students staying in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , cause conditions were hardly conducive towards June 11, 2009 intellectual study. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And there were all students that either started on a career in their home country, whether it was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Did you become friendly with some of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Oh, very much so, and —
QUESTION:  Can you remember some of their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Well, the one I remember the best wa-was Hans Solomon, who — we stayed friends, so I still correspond with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Edgar Druenhoot(ph), Hans Mayer(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Palos(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Palos(ph), and —
QUESTION:  And what about some of the artists? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">You mentioned providing equipment for the artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Do you remember some of their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I don’t remember any of their names, but I still have one or two paintings that they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Did you purchase them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  We purchased them in a way that — or they were donated. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So — and we set up exhibitions for them so they could be sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">June 11, 2009
QUESTION:  And what about some of the other artistic activities, they play — did they play musical instruments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yes, well, we were able to provide violins, cellos, guitars. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Usually had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So they would set up small musical groups, depending on the activities, and depending on the interest, depending on the health, because the condition in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> weren’t really conducive to any intellectual work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  You mentioned the Russian choir in your diary? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Do you remember meeting a group of Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  I remember very vaguely that a group of Russians — they were mainly though Russians who’d left <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> during the revolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So they were what you call the white Russians, who had settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , with a large colony of them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and with the rest of the French they left the north and came south. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So my work was primarily centered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , I lived at the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Terminus</span> , and then we’d travel regularly to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  You mentioned traveling with Donald Lowrie, can you talk a little about Lowrie? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He sounded as if he were an interesting person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Very interesting, very active, one of these what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">A-type persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Very outgoing, charming wife, who did all the driving for Donald. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And Donald had worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> with the Czechs, the <span class="BUILDING">Czech YMCA</span> , and June 11, 2009 [indecipherable] Czech, and so had a very special place in his heart for the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Any Czech student came by, always got some help. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But Don was also the head of what they called the Nimes committee, which was a committee of all the various private organizations: the Red Cross; Unitarian; Quakers; OSE, Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they met once a month in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nimes</span> , so it became known as the Nimes committee, to coordinate their efforts, and then to intervene. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And Don would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> to talk to the representatives of the government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> about permission to do certain things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  For example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Well, one thing that happened was be able to get the refugees out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , if they could support themselves, so that Vichy government did finally approve that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Whereas if an organization would provide for them so the state didn’t pay anything, they could get them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or a prisoner of private means could get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Do you remember going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  I didn’t go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nimes</span> regularly, to the Nimes committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did you actively participate in the Nimes committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yes, I was representing the student relief fund and — but the c-committee wa — it was a very [indecipherable] very worthwhile, very interesting committee, because June 11, 2009 people of various interests — the Red Cross, of course, was mainly interested in providing food, and the Swiss Red Cross particularly, took care of a lot of children, whereas some of the other organizations were providing just intellectual or spiritual help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Do you remember some of the people from the Jewish organizations? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Did you remember Raoul — Raymond-Raoul Lambert?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  No, I can’t say that I do remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I met them all, of course, and knew them, but that’s a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  At one point you mention that the Vichy government creates a — an official state organization for all Jewish organizations, Ugeef(ph), u-g-i-f. And — and you mention in your diary that Raymond-Raoul Lambert was supposed to be the general secretary and he refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Do you have any recollection of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Not really in any detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  And you also speak about meeting Dr. Markeen(ph) on a — on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He was a doctor who with OSE. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Do you remember him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  A Swiss doctor, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I just by chance met him because I travel a good deal, and meet a lot of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  And do you remember some of the memorable sessions of the Nimes committee? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Were there certain times when it became animated? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">June 11, 2009
ANSWER:  Oh, it always was animated, because everybody there was an intellectual when — very di-different interests, but they all [indecipherable] in their own interests, and — but willing to cooperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I remember especially one session where Lowrie asked for a criticism of the committee, or recommendation, what we could do to improve, and it was very open, everybody put in their two cents worth, but very — very open discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Praise for Lowrie as president, because his was a difficult job to bring them together, and get them to work together and go in one voice to Vichy. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Vichy was not too cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I think Vichy was not thought of very much by the French themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They knew it was under the control of the Germans, that Pétain, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laval</span> had very little of independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  You worked with other organizations like the Cimade, and —
ANSWER:  Met [indecipherable] Cimade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Can you tell me a little bit about the Cimade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, the Cimade was set up by the French, what they call a fede — Fédération des étudiants, a Protestant organization under Marc Boegner, who was head of the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , which 1s, of course, very much a minority in f — in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And Cimade [speaks French].</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  Very vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Not — I’d say we were not specializing in immigration — or emigration, but you couldn’t help get involved in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  You mentioned that many of the students come to see you, and some of them are violinists, or they want to study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And in your diary you seem to advise them to learn a trade, a handicraft, so they can make a living, and they seem reluctant to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Do you remember anything — what you were thinking at that point about —
ANSWER:  I think 1t was more of a practical approach to know that they — you wanted them to continue their studies, but that took a [indecipherable], a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live and steady income, which we co — we could not provide, I mean, we couldn’t provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We gave out very little money, as far as help, just in emergencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And that was true of most of the organizations, they tried not to just hand out money. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But I thought, so if June 11, 2009 I recommend that they learn a trade, at least they can earn a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">What we did — the story of the Chambon is another, different story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Could you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Yeah, in ni — at the end of ’41, we fi — figure that the students — we wanted to do something for the students, and there was a committee of the ESRF in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with Professor Lagalle(ph) from — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , who was the head of the committee — French committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And we figured we had to get the students into an atmosphere where they could really continue their studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We looked over <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , and a Mr. Guillome(ph) who was a — worked for the — a Frenchman who worked for the <span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> , been mayor of a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> Chambon-sur-Lignon [indecipherable] and so we went up to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chambon</span> , which is very up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and a very rural area, and found out that they had a treme — there are two pastors there, Pastor Truckmay(ph) and Pastor try — Tise(ph), who are very much the leaders of the community, and they had already had a number of maison d’enfants open at the Swiss Red Cross, that a couple may — where they could bring children and take care of them during that — in that manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And the main difference between Chambon et — the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , the plateau and gau — and <span class="REGION">southern France</span> on the coast, was there was plenty of food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">For the first time in I don’t know how many months, I found butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That sh — one ra — thing that struck me, I would June 11, 2009 say made the decision that we should try and settle a— a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there was, Melby and I were looking for a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , or for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could — for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could rent to put students into. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We — and we [indecipherable] the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> overnight, went out in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And the people next to us had had [indecipherable] breakfast sent up, and they put it out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , and there were two pound — two patés of butter left on the plate, so Melby and I immediately scooped it up and decided this is where we wanted to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So we did find a Maison des Roches, which the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , we were able to rent it and then had to staff it with a director and somebody could run the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  And who did you finally find?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  There was a miss — miss — Madame Pon-Pontay(ph), I think the names were. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And then eventually Daniel Truckmay(ph), the nephew of one of the pastors took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And over the year which we were in operation, there were about 75 different students who were able to take advantage of — most of them would — would come settle down, or they would decide to try to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , or disappear into the Maquis, the resi — resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So it was, from that point of view, very successful, and we were able to, as I say, get about 75 students out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , because this is one thing the go-government, or the Nimes committee had pushed for was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , get people out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and into a more or less normal living. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">June 11, 2009

<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  I—I re — of course, the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were always very mini — minimum, and I think this was towards the end of — or in ’42, where the conditions — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know, was on a <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and the conditions around it weren’t too great. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Cold and windy and this particular time when I come back, I go and visit people in the c — in the [indecipherable] or in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And — and th-this time I went to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , cause you could — they had a real <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> going on in every <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , where if you wanted something special and you had money, you could get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">In other words chocolate, or extra bread or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But this time I came back and people just looked worn out and tired and hungry, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And June 11, 2009 they’d — and they’d lost any desire to do any we — or activities were very minimum because nobody had the strength to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> or read, or to play an instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And the men, particularly, were just starving away. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And there was not a thing we could do except just encourage them to try and make some plans, which was very difficult, I mean, plan what their life, I mean, have a goal of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And they would just kind of pull the blankets up over them and just lie there. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So those are conditions that, I don’t know what anybody could have done to improve them [indecipherable] cause the food was [indecipherable], vegetables, nothing very substantial, it’s one piece of bread, which made a very de — very depressing visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Sometimes you stayed several days in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  I— usually I’d try and spend —
QUESTION:  You had a bag to sleep in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Yes, I slept — well, the Cimade personnel were sleeping in — in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , had their own <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , so I had a guest room I could — could stay when I was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  Can you describe it, what they looked like <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  Small, little cupboard, not much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They were not fancy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Was it reserved for the Cimade personnel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  Cima — Cimade, all the personnel, whether Red Cross or others. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> was particularly depressing because of the heat, and the — not sand, but kind of rock — rocky soil. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And overcrowded, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And then you never knew when there’s gonna be another exodus, or — then the Germans insisted that the Germans — the Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp be</span> sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It was kind of an interesting way in which — I suppose about a hundred thousand Germans were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , cause Hitler gave the — the gauleiter, that is the heads of certain sections of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> permission to just do what they wanted besides just get rid of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So the one near the <span class="DLF">French border</span> in <span class="REGION">southwestern Germany</span> , so it’s simple, we’ll just send them to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So they shipped them all down to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And then a year or so later they wanted them June 11, 2009 back. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That’s when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Those pictures you saw were of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> being prepared, which was always a very dramatic time, because — well, Andre Dumas, who was one of the head Cimade people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , got to know the directors and the soldiers all much better than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And for one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> he sat in with the director and decided who would — I mean, not who would go, but whether there was a discrep — whether families being separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And he’d argue with the man, no you can’t send her, because her husband’s here, or vice-a-versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And he tried —
QUESTION:  Did that work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  Did that wor — succeed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  It worked — it — it — 1t worked in that he was able to keep several families together, but also it took such a toll on him, cause if he took out one person, another person had to take their <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And Andre went oh — decided he just couldn’t morally do this any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  It seems you — you reflect in your diary about the absurdity of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Sometimes a woman’s husband is 60, so he’s excluded from a — a transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And then she’s 50 and — and she — she’Il be on it, because she’s too young to be June 11, 2009 excluded. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And if she was actually Romanian, but she was born on the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian border</span> or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Did — did you try to find ways of getting around these —
ANSWER:  You try anything, but then you also run into the moral dilemma, di — what right do you have to decide that this person should go on this [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The refugees didn’t know for sure where they were going, I suppose they had some idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But we’d already by then learned about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so the dilemma was, can we really decide that this person should not go, or should go? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now the director of the camp had to make the choice, but that was his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">End of Tape One June 11, 2009 Beginning Tape Two
QUESTION:  Going back to — to our discussion about the state you found people in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , and the fact that when they’re physically so weak and sick, that morally and intellectually, they have no — no desire —
ANSWER:  They have — they no — not only no desire, but no goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">As long as they had a goal, whether it was just to live another day or so, and they could see some hope in the future, I think that would encourage them to try and do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But when they just kind of give up and see no future at all, then that’s very depressing, not only for themselves, but for everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Because there’s really nothing you can do, you can’t give them what they really need, is more food, because you don’t have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  At one point you talk about one of the meetings of the Committee de Nimes, and Dr. Vay(ph) gave his report. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He was mentioning about, he was talking about the dire state of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and in your diary you reflect on that, and you — because he said that people were — they tried helping them by giving them more food, or giving them shots, and they were too far gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And that —
ANSWER:  I think a s — I think a person reaches a point where they’ve lost interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Either they’ve lost a mate, or they’ve just seen other people go re — go downhill, you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And once that happens, it’s awfully hard to get them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And you can’t do it June 11, 2009 with just food, you have to give them some reason for living. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And it’s true they have no reason for living, if they’re gonna be sent off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Why bother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  Did you question your beliefs, your religious faith, because of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Did that make you reflect on what you had been studying, or —
ANSWER:  Well, it makes you — well, 1t certainly makes you reflect on what you’re doing, whether there’s anything else you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">You can’t give up hope on them, because then you’ve also gotten in the same situation that they’re in. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So it’s a matter of maintaining your own spiritual feelings and beliefs, that there’s gotta be a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and a better time. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But you — if you can’t see any future, I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was in a very sad situation, economically and e-every way. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And I think I found that particularly true right — right after the big debacle, the French couldn’t realize what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They knew they had the biggest army in — in Europe, and it just disappeared, dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  You also mentioned that you were worried about the capacity to adapt of people who had been immigrating and moved around from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and —
ANSWER:  This was the difficulty, you would — everybody wanted to get out, and not everybody would put in a request for an exit visa, or for a visa from — and everybody had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Like there was one — one person who was dif — different — di — whose rel — relative worked in the <span class="BUILDING">church office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , Dr. Forell(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="382">June 11, 2009 And of course, he took a personal interest in this relative, and wrote to us about his relatives in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I said, well, if you can get him a visa, that the best thing you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Well, even with all his connections, he couldn’t get a visa for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So you had to tell a person, well, not now, but keep on hoping, keep — so it was not surprising that people would try and walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and head for the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  Do you remember if any of them were caught?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  Oh, some were caught, I mean the — I don’t know how many hundreds had tried to get across. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But — well, even, for instance, a person with an American passport, and a visa like Ronald Elliot, who was one of the leaders of the World Student Christian Federation, came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">This was before <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was in the war, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And he had an exit permit, and wi — so he came down to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , which 1s fairly near to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And we’d showed him around and spend the day or so with him showing him different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Then he got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cerbere(ph</span> ), which is <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and was turned down for some reason, they didn’t accept his exit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So he’d come back and we spent another day with him, put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again, about three times before he finally got across. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And he had all the papers he needed, but s-some folks in there along the way decided well, why should I let him go? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So — June 11, 2009
QUESTION:  You mentioned that sometimes the guards gave you trouble, going from one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the other because perhaps they didn’t recognize you, or they had orders, or other times they let you go right through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Well the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not run 1n very fashionable, very military way, and the thing that — oh, I think I mentioned that Madame Jurano(ph), who was a Swiss lady, a very good friend from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> down visiting, and she got so mad when the — she went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was the guard smoking, and talking to her with cigarette in his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And being the good Swiss, she felt that was disgusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But that was typical of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I mean, s-sol — soldiers were not — they were civilian guards, or soldiers, they just had no discipline at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So you could — in one way it was very easy to get in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , another way you never knew when they were gonna crack down and make it more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  At one point you — you mention even organizing activities for them because they seem to be bored.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Oh, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I mean, who likes to stand at a <span class="DLF">gate</span> for eight, 10 hours? </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It didn’t work out too well, cause they’d come one time and then not show up for another month or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  At one point you mentioned looking for the Madagascarians, or the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">June 11, 2009
ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Madagascar</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  And could you tell me a little about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  Well see, this was a mil — originally a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> , and it was set up for troops in <span class="REGION">north Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The beginning of the war, they’d come and stay there, then go up to the fr — to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And evidently these were Madagascarans who were in — recruited to fight and then the war was over, so they didn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Eventually they came to work in the — to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">See, the Germans, or the French and Germans tried to put everybody — every male, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , cause there were so many soldiers who were still prisoners in euro — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they needed a lot of workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">In fact, some of our students were sent over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> , which was a big submarine base for the Germans, and worked in the <span class="DLF">foundations</span> there for a while, until some colonel, German colonel found out they were Jewish and sent them back.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  What did he want them to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Probably labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  He heard that you had cheap labor? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">June 11, 2009
ANSWER:  Labor, maybe a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , maybe work. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It’s amazing when you take out a whole army of young men, how qui — hard it is to get anything done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  You mentioned you remember when <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> enters the war after Pearl Harbor, and you write in your diary on the ninth of December, 1941 that we’ve entered the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And that is the beginning of a period of uncertainty for you, because you don’t know if you’ll be able to continue your activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Well, we knew that the Germans were in control at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , although not openly, and I’m sure they are not happy to see <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> come into the war, or the — or in th — in fact, for a while, as I recall, we, after Pearl Harbor, <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> declared war on us, and we declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , but not on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So —
QUESTION:  You mentioned that you went into <span class="BUILDING">Les Milles</span> and somebody told you that they had a —a secret radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I suppose every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had some secret radios like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They try and hide and so they get news long before we would. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But that —
QUESTION:  What was your feeling when you heard that <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had entered the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  I suppose like everybody else, kind of shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And then, course I started thinking whether we should really get out, or we could — Lowrie, I know at one time, wanted to leave right away and go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , he wanted to get involved in the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I guess he found out it wasn’t that easy to get out as June 11, 2009 quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Eventually he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , along with, I think, most of the other Americans who were working in one of the various organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But at the time we didn’t know whether we’re gonna be taken, put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , as the Americans in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were, of course were. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But there they had the protection of the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , we had no protection at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And we could have joined the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  That was a serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  It was, very definitely, whether we should try and leave while we still could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  And you decided to stay on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  We decided to stay on, that we had a responsibility to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And there was no, at the time there was no outward expression from the Germans [indecipherable] still unoccupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I think the thing that took it off was the French navy was down in — in the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And the — eventually, the Germans wanted the navy and the — the French scuttled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , which was a big blow to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I think the German after that were — were much more strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And eventually they did just take over all of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  And what happened at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="447">June 11, 2009
ANSWER:  At that point we were — had either gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> or went — actually, I think I talked to one of the young Cimade fellows who had helped smuggle people into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">He showed me how to get across the barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Take your coat off, throw the coat over, then jump oh — jump over, but I didn’t have to do that, fortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  Let’s go back a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">There was a point where the French were inspecting the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They had a man named Andre Jonfur(ph), who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , and he was doing a report on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Do you remember ever being present when there were Vichy officials visiting the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  There was also a point where the German general Danika(ph) started visiting the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was in July 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You — do you have — remember hearing about that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  Rivesaltes kept changing its disposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Apparently they kept moving people from one ilo(ph) and <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And you mention that you had to change your <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and your <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">How — do you know wh-why that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  I think what — the reason they moved the internees from one ilo(ph) to the other, they had certain ilos(ph) that they were getting ready to ship people out in, and they wanted to get them into a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> all together.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Were there people who — who were saying goodbye and didn’t —
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, because th-these were their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Most of the people had come together from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and had shipped down here and known each other in June 11, 2009 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for years, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And then for some reason one group was sent off — sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and others was kept in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And eventually the camp was — I assume was completely liquidated.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Yeah, there were times like that, when people —
QUESTION:  Can you describe that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Well, it’s always dramatic, because normally they tried to run things very smoothly, just put people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and drive away. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And then if at the last minute there’s a change in people, like if somebody intervened, or if somebody else had called Vichy with a name of a person they wanted to take off, or — and Vichy would respond to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they’d have to take them off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  And what could be some of the reasons that the person would be taken off? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">June 11, 2009

<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  And when the person actually had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Then there’d be somebody else who’d be put in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was real dramatic cause they’d — they’d say they cut [indecipherable] 150 people and stop there, the next 10 people in <span class="DLF">line</span> would be sent back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , or be kept there until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> left, if they didn’t have to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So it’s — it was dra — always dramatic and tragic time, cause you hate to see anybody — anybody be taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Did you know exactly where they were going? </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You knew they would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Rivesaltes train station</span> , but did you know where they were headed after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I think it’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, and they’d probably spend some time there, and then they go back to — then they’d go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Where they — which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp they</span> went to, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , wherever they — or in some cases they were — if they were young enough, they go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they put them under <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> needed a — June 11, 2009 needed a lot of workers too with the whole army out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So you couldn’t — you couldn’t say for sure or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  At the end of the day, what was the atmosphere around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Very somber. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Nobody really felt like doing anything, because you’d been pretty well drained just watching them leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So what —
QUESTION:  Was your religion any consolation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  They what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Was the Bible or religion any consolation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I suppo — I think there may have been a service of some kind, but not necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">No, it was more or less just a complete let down when you work with people for a number of months, and then some of them disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I guess fortunately, we didn’t know for sure where they were going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  How — did you — you were present at several of these events, of these deportations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  I think only a couple.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, I— they more or less transfer one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the other, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> are all different. </span><span class="sentence" id="567"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> were probably the two big camps for German — German refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Vernet was more of a political — political prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  You also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noé</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Recebedou</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  Recebedou yes, I do remember those two well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Milles</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Milles</span> was right next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> and — and that was a more hopeful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> cause that’s where they were — those who had their first papers in order and had to get more papers would ca — go to Les Milles cause then they go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , see the <span class="BUILDING">consulates</span> and work on getting their final papers together, so that was a— much more of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transient camp</span> , even though very active with artists and — and a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  When you knew that the — you — you were present at two of these <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> , did you find out when others were going to occur?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  I don’t recall, I don’t think so, no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I don’t think anybody knew because the germ — Germans would make the decision, we need 150 or 200 or 300.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  But every time you went back, you weren’t sure the people you knew would still be there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  Very much so, cause the Spaniards had been there for about three years, three or four years, since the end of the Spanish revolution, and they’d pretty much settled in and made their own position there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="593">June 11, 2009
QUESTION:  Did they have more freedom than the others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  I'd say they did because they’d been there longer, and they knew the way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And th-they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go either, they were — they weren’t too welcome in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but there — on the other hand, they took care of them, the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Did they have the same rations as the rest of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  They must have had more, because they did their own cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I think I mentioned once that they invited me over to dinner, and they cooked Spanish rice on an open fire out in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And served a very good dinner, which I appreciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Food was pretty much a central thought in everybody’s mind all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But — so when you had a good meal, then the — made a lot of difference.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  You communicated in French?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  French, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They’d learned enough French by then to get by. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But they — they weren’t really internees so much as just residents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because I say, they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> — they couldn’t go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Well, as I recall, the Spanish dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">They had more energy than the Germans, because they had, I suppose, better food that they prepared themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But, course they wanted — they didn’t want to get too settled in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , because they wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> eventually after Franco left. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But tha — they didn’t see any future, because they c — they knew they couldn’t go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> — to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> without being put in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> or shot.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="829">ANSWER:  I think it gave me a greater appreciation of people, understanding of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I’m not sure it gave me any special skills, except I think I found that Americans are not very much interested in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Right after the war, they’d had enough of the war, and — and [indecipherable] so, in matter of teaching, you tried to bring in the things that had happened and their influence on their lives, but most people were much more interested in getting jobs and buying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  At one point in your diary you are at a meeting of the Committee de Nimes, and you ’ve heard one of the dire reports that Dr. Vay(ph) gave about malnutrition and — and you ha — you reflect upon what — that you thought man was intrinsically good, but maybe the cruelty and the absurdity that you saw around you shook you. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And you seemed to talk about perhaps we are in the grips of demonic forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Seems that you were —
ANSWER:  I don’t know if I went so f— well, maybe I have [indecipherable] demonic forces, but a — I certainly realized that the world was not a peaceful <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and that in some ways there was very little you could do to make any changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">You could change individuals, and that’s why I concentrated on individuals and working with June 11, 2009 them, whereas major changes were something that it was really very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">You realize there’s gonna be crises around the world. [</span><span class="sentence" id="837">indecipherable] I was talking to a group of — actually at a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and — where Hans Solomon(ph) was — lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And one of the questions after this [indecipherable] group of students who said, well, can the Holocaust ever happen again? </span><span class="sentence" id="839">The only thing I can say wi — look, there’s enough — enough — enough problems already, wa — like dur — like all in the middle — in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> , crises like that, in <span class="REGION">north Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And I’m not sure we settled all those yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I ju-just hope that it never can happen again on such a schedu — scale.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  I think as I reflect back on it, I realize the very extraordinary times. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">That I was very fortunate to be able to be in a situation where I could do some — some good, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But it gave me an appreciation of difficulties people have and that you can do something, even though very small, just by giving a person a book, or June 11, 2009 crayons, or artists. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">At least give them temporary relief from their situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">That we’re not gonna solve all the problems right away.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="864">ANSWER:  Well, I felt — first, my letters to my parents, we’ve always corresponded. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And I felt if I could at least open up with somebody, and give them some sense of my feelings and my beliefs, that would help — help to go on to continue with the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And the diary I just felt [indecipherable] this is a special time, and —

<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think you begin to realize that people want to share, and always need somebody they can open up to, and can talk to, and felt that through education there was a possibility of helping people realize what they want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">It becomes a very personal thing after a while, looking for a warm contact with people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  You must have established it with your students, if you stayed on and — for 25 years in one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and — and probably there was an exchange there.</span></p>
