<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Could you explain what it means to be a volunteer in the Red Cross in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What kind of training you had, and --
ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I joined when I was about 16 or 17 as a junior, and when I was 18 I became a senior, and when you were 18 you had to sign a paper to say that you would be mobile or immobile. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">If you were immobile, it meant that in case of national emergency, you could be used from your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when you had time. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">If you were mobile, you were liable to be called up to serve with the services, whichever forces, and I had to be mobile, so that was why I was called up, it --

<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  And what sort of training, what -- what --
ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">While we were members, every week we would go to classes and lectures and we learned how to do first aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We even did chemical warfare, we had lectures on that, and we also, once a year we would have to go to a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> and do work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> like a real nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we had three days on medical, three days on surgical and one day in the <span class="BUILDING">operating theater</span> , so that, you know, we had a good background and it wasn’t just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedpans</span> , it was -- and making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , it was really in depth work. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And we were all bright young things and eager to do our part, so, you know, it was -- it was very interesting and rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Was it frightening to be in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during all these bombings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well, some nights, you know, when I was going on duty to one of the <span class="BUILDING">underground stations</span> , as long as I had my tin hat on and my gas mask, I felt fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But the shrapnel was going around, and you know, you just did your thing, and it was dark, and you couldn’t have a -- a torch -- flashlight as they’re called here. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And you just did your thing, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Were you -- did -- did you ever have any close calls, where --
ANSWER:  Yes, but that was when I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woolidge</span> , when they were doing the bus bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I would be out with a friend, we’d maybe gone for a walk somewhere up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and he would say, wait a minute, there’s one coming, duck. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And we’d lie down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and we’d count, and then you could tell, from the moment that the engine stopped, whereabouts it might fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They were the closest calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But you know, when you’re -- when you’re in the thick of things, you don’t -- you don’t worry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You just care about people not getting hurt.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="457">Why don’t you come down here and we’ll set you up in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He knew catering because he’d been <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">catering ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So Nina and this husband came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and I don’t know if you ever went there, but there was a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span> called <span class="BUILDING">The Diplomat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was on <span class="DLF">Wisconsin Avenue</span> , it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And then they finally retired, and they sold the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Her husband died at the beginning of this year, and anyhow, I spoke to Nina and I said, Nina, would you be willing to be interviewed if they think that you would have a good story? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">She said of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So anyhow --
