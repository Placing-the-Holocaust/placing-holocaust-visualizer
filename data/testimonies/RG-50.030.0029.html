<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> is one of the really wonderful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> along...next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Donau</span> , River Donau [NB: the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And as most of...like everyone likes his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was grown up there, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there; and uh lived there 'til my...'til I was twenty- seven, when I married and I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to live in another uh city--in _ilina, in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">During uh these early years, tell me a little about your parents and the family that you grew up in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father was a furrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I was the eighth child in the family; so that means a big family. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We went through the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">This was very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">When I was five years old, I had to still get up early--five o'clock in the morning--and stand in the queue to get bread or milk, or whatever was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It...I started to go still in the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Then later on...and actually later in...in the grade uh nine and ten-- what you could call here nine, uh grade nine and ten--I went to, in a <span class="BUILDING">commercial Schule</span> [<span class="BUILDING">school</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That's a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...and had my education mixed German and Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">When I was sixteen, I started to uh...I went as apprentice in a business to be trained as a salesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I worked there from 1926 'til 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Then I was called up to the army for the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I did my eighteen months. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">After eighteen months service, I started to work as a commercial traveller [NB: a salesman], which I did ‘til uh 1942--with certain interruptions, because I was representing the firma...the company AGFA, photo company. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And in 1938, I was dismissed because of my Jewish origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">After that, I had different jobs--whatever I could find to feed my family--because I married in 1930 uh...37, in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had a son in November [1937]; and in...(cough) we lived this time already in _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> where I was travelling around a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We choose _ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> as a point to live because that was more or less in the center of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , my <span class="REGION">region</span> .... How you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Where...where I had to work, and I could be more often with my...with the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  And if we were to think now about the time when the war broke out, could you tell us your memory of the actual beginning of the war, as it affected you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  The first uh...that was already before the war, that I lost my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And the second thing was affected me personally is, when the new <span class="REGION">Slovakian state</span> was established we was thrown out from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> what we had in a quiet uh good uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and had to move out in the outen [NB: outer] uh reg...region of that...of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So this been actually only everything personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Then I had different jobs and worked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Then ...when the...the day-to-day life naturally was always full of uh fear and uh...tension; because every...every night or every day, when you heard somebody walking by under your <span class="DLF">window</span> , you never knew if he is coming to pick you up or what...what is he will. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">What is tense, the way if the sound of the steps will stop in front of you, or if they are going further up. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So in...1940, 1941, we been once picked up from the Hlinka Guard to taken away to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Through some unknown uh reasons, we been...after a few days we been released, and we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But before, when we been taken in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where there are concentrated uh people, they took away half our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Which...which we didn't get back when we have been released, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So that made our lives even again very hard, because no income but needs was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So we struggled through 'til the second uh time. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">One day after Yom Kippur in 1942--it was the 21st or 22nd of uh September--a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> for two men in civil clothing, two men in the...in the Hlinka Guard uniform. "</span><span class="sentence" id="44">You have a half an hour time. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Pick up your belongings and follow us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So they took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They let us stay in in front of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I didn't know what 1s going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , because it was a big excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">After a while, a man came out with a bundle of uh papers which later ... which I found out later was the list of the deportees, every <span class="NPIP">where</span> going forty...forty names of every list. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So when he came out, he said, "Take your belongings and follow me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was already prepared, standing there not far away...about hundred twenty, hundred fifty meters away. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">That was a small <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="53">Go up!" </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And a few minutes after that, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Yeah, and they put into every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> they put in a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">One man was the responsible for the order in the ...that special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> in which, how I mentioned before, forty people was uh...only forty people. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Because they from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> ...there came up to hundred twenty, hundred fifty forced in. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So we had a very luxurious uh travel comparing to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So when the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed, I went to the man whom I know and ask him, "Let me see that uh piece of paper what you got. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Give it to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So I saw forty names typed with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> ; and during the forty names, five names was uh...four names was crossed out, and our four names--I myself, my wife, my son and my mother-in-law--put in with pencil. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">That was the machination of that people who run the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> and they been the real collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And they got what they deserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Because then in 1944, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> where some of them have been thrown against the electric wires and some of them have been killed by the inmates, just who remembered what they have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So we ca...we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The usual uh selections: women and children and olderly [NB: elderly] on this side; Arbeitszwang, how they called it--the people who was able to work--on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So these people went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , and we went to the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I don't know for what reason we have been registered in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> like the usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We been taken straight away in a [Struhutstamm (ph)] [to] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lager Auschwitz</span> , where we got a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We had to throw everything on a heap. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> we had to leave on the on the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> in the railway...in the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And...somehow, I don't know what happened, they said everybody can keep his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Anything else...not socks, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Only shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I got, after the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> what we got...they didn't gave us any towels. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They gave me a shirt which was two numbers too small. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So 'til I was working myself into that shirt, I had my shoes between my legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I got from somebody, from one of the old Haftlings who had something...something to work there, a push. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I lost my balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He grabbed my shoes and ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I knew very well the shoes are life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So again by accident, I had still my watch on. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I don't know why I had still my watch on. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">A Polish man, I know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They called him "Bogdan.” </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was working in the Politisch Abteilung [Trans: "Political Department" |--that was the Lager Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And he told me, "Give me your watch.” </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I told him, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I give you my watch, because I know what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But I see you have to...1t seems to me that you have here some kind of a influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That what did happen with my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Bring me a pair of shoes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So when we was uh...we got the normal stripped clothes, and we was taken to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">This time we was uh placed in the <span class="BUILDING">Barrack number 10</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">This <span class="BUILDING">Barrack number 10</span> has... has a special history; because there used to be woman in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and later on it was the experimental block again--the same block. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Next to 1t was a block--Block number 11--which was the execution block. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And the <span class="DLF">windows</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">Block 10</span> , in between <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> and 10, was all uh covered up, boarded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We could sometimes peep through little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> with little cracks and...and see what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So I been this uh block a few days when the first...shock was big naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The first even bigger shock came when one when one of these uh Kommandos--in which one of my friends went out--came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they brought him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">That was about the fourth or maybe fifth days...day what we been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So I started to ask questions: how did that that fellow uh was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">What...what has he done? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So, nothing special; only his Polish Vorarbeiter [Trans: "foreman" or "gang boss"| came to him and said, "Listen, if you promise me that you'll give me your ration in the evening then I will keep you alone...uh, leave you alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I won't uh beat you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And he sometime...he get got angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He had still a little bit cour...courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And lifted his spade against that fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was a prisoner, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And naturally that was [in|subordination. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">A few German colleagues of his saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So they beat him to death with the spades. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">That was...and a few different...uh, similar experiences, what I... what we went through in the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The endless standing and Schikanieren [NB: chicanery] what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Twelve o'clock in the night they woke us up: "Alles andrehen!" </span><span class="sentence" id="118">For say the "Appell," for no reason whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Sometimes they...they chased us down to the...the front of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Sometimes they let us stand for hours in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that we're standing next to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And...so, like naturally everybody had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Nobody could and should stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without special permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">If somebody was caught up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from SS man or from anybody who ask him, "What you are doing here in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> during the day?" </span><span class="sentence" id="124">When you didn't have the proper excuse, it was finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Straight away into the <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> this times; and the next transport, <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Regardless your health, stand [NB: state] of health, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I...we worked in different uh Kommandos, different <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> ...
QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">work place</span> were you assigned to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  In uh in one stage I was uh working in one group with that builded uh...build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River So_a</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That was a tributary of the uh River Wis_a. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Vistula, if you heard about these names. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That they planned there a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , a <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My first job to cleaning the big pine trees from the uh...to clean it up that the [people (ph)] should be absolutely clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And how with a spade, just to scratch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And later I came their building company...company. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That was the Un...later on, it was the Union uh <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I started to dig the foundations. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the German Kapo, who was a [kaminlog (ph)]-- somehow because I spoke a very perfect German, he talked somehow to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he talked me in, because he was more or less analphabet, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You know what...illiterate. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Illiterate. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I did the writing jobs for him; and he looked so far after me that he organized for me clean clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That was something what saved later--in a few weeks later--my life, when we are coming to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I worked there with 'til about beginning of January of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">One evening, we are marching in from the...from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I was already quite weak from three month nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Just the exact rations, and no source sometime...somewhere to get something extra. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We marching through...through the <span class="DLF">door</span> ; and we uh...SS is standing at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and screaming, "All the Jews to the parade ...to the <span class="BUILDING">parade place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The <span class="DLF">Appellplatz</span> , where they.... That never sounded very well, but what we had to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We didn't know what the reason was. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And one of the Kommandofihrers--[Stibbitz (ph)| was his name--came and started to count and sort out from these...I don't know how many thousand people...uh, and put and told them, "Go here. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Go here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And he came to me, and I was the last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Looked at me and told me, "Oh, you look quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You uh...you.... Du bist gut aus." -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="157">You look quite well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Uh, and that I was the last one. "</span><span class="sentence" id="159">Turn left. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">March!" </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I didn't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And it turned out that was the Kommando Kanada where I was uh uh assigned to. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So next day morning, we marched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We went to <span class="BUILDING">Kanada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We saw what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We could get some food, changed underwear...
QUESTION:  Let's go back just a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">You say you saw what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  It was going on that...that all the effects, all the effects from the people who came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was brought to us and we had to sort them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And what was uh uh useful for them, that was sorted out and sent everything to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We had daily a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of different type of uh goods which went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I, for instance, I was working in a magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I packed the spectacles, the glasses, the cutlery, the...the shaving brushes and differents...these small things, in big baskets. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I don't know if you remember these old pleated travel baskets from heavy...from heavy uh cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So we had to pack them full, close them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I had to write on "KL Au," which mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Auschwitz</span> , the number what...what was on the [to goes (ph)| would be the papers, wind it...wind strings around it, and up it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Hundreds and hundreds of these baskets with uh brea...with uh spectacles, with everything--items what I mentioned before--went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So when somebody is coming today to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and sees a heap of uh spectacles and shav...shaving uh uh brushes, he thinks whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But that was only a ver...that 1s only a very, very small percentage of that what went, that effects we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So, in beginning of 19...1n about mid-April in 1943, I got typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So naturally I didn't went in the beginning to the so-called <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; and I went every day to work with ninety degrees temperature. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">That was three kilometers there, three kilometers back. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Maybe a little bit less. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You know, actually...I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I am mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was less; because this time uh the Kommando was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And...wait a minute...I have to rectify myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Something is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">End of January, one day when we went from the Kommando instead to go to back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they turned us to the right and they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Which was...that was more than three kilometres coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We got the uh...we been relocated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We had to come everyday these three kilometers from and to, to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And then happened that I got the uh typhus, and with ninety degree I had to walk this three kilometers every day, now and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">In about end of May '43, something...I can't remember exactly what happened in the Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And uh our Hauptscharfuhrer, who was our uh supervisor there, took us--about five or six of us-- brought out from one of the magazines the heaviest fur coats what he could ever find. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The heavy Russian fur coats, what the Russian peasants used to wear in winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The lambs wool. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I mean, sheeps...sheepskin, not lambs' wool. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Sheepskin. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Such a coat was at least five, six kilogram heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">That's means ten, twelve pound; and that was a very, very hot day. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I had ninety degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And he commanded us to "make sport"--that was express what they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Run, lie down. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Up, run, up, run...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He did it with us one hour long, the whole so-called lunch time. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Naturally, I was extremely exhausted after that when we finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So I went uh...I said I can't go back to the next day; so I went in the evening to the so-called "Revier"--Krankenbau [NB: the "sick bay"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So when I came there, I saw the <span class="BUILDING">Krankenbau</span> is nearly empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And a friend of mine who was working there said, "The <span class="BUILDING">Krankenbau</span> was taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">You have a few days time. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">You can rest here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So I had been there about five or six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Krankenbau</span> filled up, so the danger came always closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I decided to tell him, "Listen, check me out from here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="217">What he did; and really the next day the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krankenbau</span> went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Again a brush with death. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So I came uh out, back to the work force. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">How you say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And for some reason, they didn't want to do...to take me back to the <span class="REGION">Kanada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So I started again and going out for manual work. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And then...just a moment, I remember now something which was before what was actually the reason from...for that what they made the sport. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I had a friend in uh...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> who was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I had one of my tooth hurted, so I went to him he should pull me it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So I wanted to uh show my appreciation for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So I brought him a little bit of a...of Tabak, cigarette Tabak [NB: tobacco] what I found in the <span class="REGION">Kanada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And on the way back, they let us...undressed us, naked, and they found the cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And for that I got a two month...two months in the <span class="BUILDING">Straf company</span> [NB: Strafkommando = "punishment brigade". </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The <span class="BUILDING">Straf company</span> is the...everybody knows what a straf company...company is. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">When we work, our work was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We was digging uh a <span class="DLF">channel</span> to...to let off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ; because that was swamp area, a canalization. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we was digging it to the...down to the banks of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , that it shouldn't be the...the terrain should be dry, the possibility to dry out. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I was working up 'til here in mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">On the end of the work, my colleagues had to pull me out; because by myself, between the cane what was going there, I would never came out by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Only with help. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I did it...to our good luck, we...we have been released for some reason not in two months [but] after six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So I came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So I turned to a few friends for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So they helped me a little bit--here a piece of bread, here a little bit something to eat, something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And naturally that was the time when we came back to workforce. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Meantime, I had already a few people whom I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So I started to work; and again thanks to my knowledge in German, I got different uh jobs more or less...at least part Schreiber [Trans: "scribe"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And now I work, say two hours; and two hours I worked in one small Kommando as Schreiber. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">In the afternoon, again I worked two hours, and went two hours this so-called clerical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So that...what I made my life a little bit easier; because as a reward for my Schreiber work, I got a little bit of a soup extra from the kapo of that Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Then...one of my...a friend of mine, he get...uh got a position in the Kanada Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">He some...somehow was uh promoted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I go...go to...went to him, and told him, "Listen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Uh, Carl was his name. "</span><span class="sentence" id="252">Say, Carl, can you do something for me? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Look how I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Look how I look. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I would need a little bit to recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Take me back to the Kommando.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="257">Oh, yes, I will arrange that you are coming tomorrow to the Kommando.” </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So I have been there a couple of weeks; and some jealousy and intrigues started against that man who brought me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So say the...the...the Haftlings, the prisoners, uh claimed that I was working for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">That mean, I was stealing goods from the Kommando and carrying it for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The only thing what I ever "organized"--that was the slang expression for stealing--I organized only food. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">For myself, and for a few friends for whom I could help with what I brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I could share with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So it went so far that they started to uh work against me. '</span><span class="sentence" id="266">Til one day, one of the fellows came to me and told me, "When you are coming tomorrow morning to work, you are not going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So naturally I didn't came. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This time a new Kommando started to...came in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Our job was to dismantle <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> which has been shot up around that <span class="REGION">area</span> , regardless German, English, American. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And I befriended myself with that kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I knew him from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We worked always...already sometime together. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He knew about my knowledge of the German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So I started there as a Schreiber. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We started there with about a hundred uh prisoners, and slowly it was built up to about thirteen hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So the responsibility was quite big, because we had to have very exact evidence--every single number who was in the Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">In one case, I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I don't know if they succeeded or...or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But the fact was they didn't came in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Big excitement. "</span><span class="sentence" id="281">Schreiber from [zelligbatterie (ph)], nach voraus!"--"To the front to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Give me the numbers uh from these two men who are missing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I didn't have that on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I turned around to go back; and I saw my assistant was already running behind me waving the piece of paper where the two numbers have been written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Because that what happens in the morning before we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Every group of twenty had to be...uh their...his...their numbers had to written down on a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And they had to be compared during the day, if he was yesterday in at work or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So a lot of uh unnecessary scribbling. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But he...so he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">He gave up that piece of paper to the SS in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They look at that are the numbers. "</span><span class="sentence" id="292">Hor auf!" </span><span class="sentence" id="293">That mean, "Disappear!" </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So we went back with no consequences whatsoever for us, because we been right. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">If I couldn't have produced the two numbers, that would be the end of...of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So I just want to mention that what uh kind of job and what...what the...what uh dangers in there...have been there everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Every moment was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Having a assistant this time, the new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> arrived on the same uh <span class="DLF">track</span> where we got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> where we unloaded the remnantses [sic] and the raw material from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The aluminum and every usable <span class="NPIP">part</span> was uh sorted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">The old aluminum what went in the <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> or 1n the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , that was recycled. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So...and sometime on the same track came new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And in the Kanada, they had the duty...when a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came, they had been on the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> ; and when they threw away their belongings, they had to collect it, pick it up and throw it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> which took them to the working place of the Kanada. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But they been quite experienced already to sneak out where is something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So one of my friend--his name was [Juri (ph)] Fried. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I don't know where he exists today, and looking for him in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now when I've been there; but I couldn't get any uh news about him, where he exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So he...I have to mention that on the end of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the newcomers has to disembark from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I went there when I saw from afar that the transport is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So I went there, hide myself in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> ; and LJuri (ph)] Fried came with...always with bags full of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I was staying there and waiting 'til everything was over with, 'til the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So I took my harvest what I had and went back to the main Kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And here in one day I had a quite a good harvest. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I called up all the Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I had uh twenty-six of them; because thirteen hundred people...every hundred had two kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I called them up and told them, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I want your sticks what you are using to beating the people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Very big surprise. "</span><span class="sentence" id="317">What is this?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="318">You are getting from me food for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I don't mind if you have a small vine from some of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> here 1n your hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But the big heavy ones I want to have, because I need it as heating material for I will let cook for you something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I have the raw material.” </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So that was one of my biggest deeds, in my opinion, what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners. '</span><span class="sentence" id="323">Specially I didn't know everybody personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But if only one was saved from two or three uh hits through a day, that was already something. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So slowly, slowly they got used to it; and the beating let up. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Screaming, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Screaming doesn't hurt to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So then one day in August 19 uh...44, we been on the march <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh from the.... We worked on Sundays too. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Coming uh <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , coming in front...one of my duties was to arrange the hundreds that they should be at the long march. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We had about nearly four kilometer march, and thirteen hundred people are walking tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They are not walking like soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So in front of the uh came about hundred fifty, two hundred meters--and that was exactly opposite the Lager C where my wife used to be this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I stopped there, without looking back what is going on behind my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Just at that moment, I saw a group of girls standing there around. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I didn't know how they came there, what they did there. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And during the time I was ordered...making that order, the SS man who was in charge in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in a wooden <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , he called my wife in. "</span><span class="sentence" id="337">Come here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="338">She went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">She made the procedure that uh how she had to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And that...and he was drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">He hardly saw (laughter)...and he hardly knew what he is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And asked her, "Do you have a boyfriend?" </span><span class="sentence" id="343">She was surprised about that question, and said, "No, I haven't got one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And he asked, "Why?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="345">Because nobody wants me," she said to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And he said, "I will take care that somebody should want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The first man who is passing here by, they had to want...have to want you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So the first one who came by was myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So he told me, "Talk to her!" </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, naturally, on her number I recognized right away that she is a girl from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And uh, naturally, I ask, "What is your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">What...where are you from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And about one or two such trivial questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">When she said, "I can't talk like this....”’ To the SS man. "</span><span class="sentence" id="355">I can't talk to this...to a man whom I never saw before like this on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And except [NB: besides], he has other duties to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And he said, "Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">You are...you are right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He called me. "</span><span class="sentence" id="360">Come here!" </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I told him, "Yes, what you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He said, "Tomorrow morning you are reporting here. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And you have to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And to her, she [NB: he] said, "You will be here in the morning, and you will stay here in the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And when he cames, you will write his number in in the book.” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Because everybody who came in or out was registered in a book, to keep it very exact and clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So with that episode finished in that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So I, I did my job further; and I joined to the last five people who went in uh... went into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So straight away, when I came in, I went to my close friend, Erich Kulka--who is now here as a historian, he just recently got his doctorate for something--with whom we are still in good friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So I went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He was one of the maintenance men in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and one of the few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , when if something was broken down he was the man who had to repair it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">He was working there as a engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They call in English "engineer," but a Schlosser [Trans: locksmith, mechanic or fitter]-- he was a fitter, or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So he...I knew that he went quite often in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">womans camps</span> , too; and I knew that he knows Magda. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So I went straight to him and asked him, "Listen, Erich. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">What is your opinion about Magda? </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Do you know her?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="378">Yes, I know her very well.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="379">And what is your opinion?" </span><span class="sentence" id="380">He said, "I will tell 1t to you in one sentence.

It was the 7th of May in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I was wandering around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> because in the same camp atrived a lot of Hungarian uh men who came from the Don and from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dnieper</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">From these <span class="REGION">area</span> , from deep in uh...in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And from the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , there came a forced march. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And being Hungarian, and I had relatives in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">township</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungaria</span> [<span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So I went around in the hope that I will find somebody whom I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So I went in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ; and a fellow came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And I ask him, "I hear uh people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szombathely</span> ....” That is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I had an uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I knew...know he had four sons and three daughters, or whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And somebody told me, "Yes, there are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Whom you think?" </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I said, "I would like now if one of the Blau boys are here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I couldn't tell the name, which of them could be, because there are four boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He told me, "Yes, they are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">One is here.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="569">Where is he?" </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Indeed I ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I...he looked back.
