(</span><span class="sentence" id="184">cough) And what did I have to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I had to improve technically the productivity of the individual worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I made hundreds of people unemployed by this. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">You know, if I...1 show you why I have example... was in...uh...busy in a <span class="BUILDING">spinning mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">In the <span class="BUILDING">spinning mill</span> , they had...was a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and they...uh...made spin...spun thread. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And the thread is then put on the spool. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And the...the...the speed of the spool going around depends how speeds how big the speed is of the stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Well, when the spool got thicker, how the spool get the same revolution, then the thread gets quicker, therefore it gets thinner and breaks more often. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Therefore, they had too, for each spinning stole, they have to two girls to observe the spool. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And if...uh...uh...thread broke, they had stop the machine and put the threat together again, let the machine run. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We made a technically the thing so that the speed of the speeding was always the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">That means that when the spool could double the size, the speed of the turning was half. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And we put electric motors on 1t which varied its speeds according to the size of the spool. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And then they had much less breaks and the...and the quality of the thread was better. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But they only needed | girl per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They had 200 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stools</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They got 5...200 girls got unemployed. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And I was invited as an electrical engineer by the director of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for many times, and I asked him there what do you do with these 200 women back unemployed. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He said, "That's not my business.” </span><span class="sentence" id="203">That's their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So I made 200 girls unemployed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When they asked him what should they do now, and he said they have to seek their own income. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And if they're....you're nice girl, they can find their income through prostitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But he saved me, so I was in a dilemma. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I was as a electrical engineer, I was improving the productivity of the individual worker and made with that lots of people unemployed. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And my wife and I we were considered what should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">What should we do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we don't get any work. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">In Russian, they don't wish us. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you make so many people unemployed? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">What do we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">My wife was same youth movement and she had the same question, and so we were working with the Socialist Youth Movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but we saw no results. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was not better. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And I know at that time when the talk came on Hitler, people everywhere laughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Hitler impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Hitler is not even a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He's an Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He is an illegit and a chld. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">He's only...he's not a studied man...he's only a house painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And he has a grandfather...illegitimate grandfather who 1s a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Do you that he ever gets to the power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Everybody laughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And 5 years later he was there in democratic fashion, because according to democratic rules, he...he became chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Let's...let's stay with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Not... and knowing...the people knew exactly what he represented. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">In any case, we stopped the work and after 2 years 1n...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we started ourselves a community in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And because we said how is it possible that people...the whole humanity can become socially just and in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We have to do it ourself before we can expect from the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We have to experience it ourselves whether it's possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And...and secondly if we represent that people can only believe us if we do it ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So the question is always that we don't expect from the others to do things, but we do it ourselves first of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And so therefore this reason we started to live in community, idealistic community like the kibbutz from idealism and peace and justice that we represented that we lived that. (</span><span class="sentence" id="237">clearing throat) But then we made experience that there were as many ideas as there were idealists, and we couldn't come to common unity as community expresses, and we were looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Where is that unity that we found? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And we found it only in the will of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Only if we all do the will of God, then we become united. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And so we after 3 years, we joined the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who represented that. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Christ...Christ for us...Christ is not the founder of the <span class="BUILDING">Christian churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The <span class="BUILDING">Christian churches</span> do exactly the opposite of what Christ said.

<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  How long...you...you joined the Hutterian Brotherhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Was it called that at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  It was so. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">1930 we started in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to live in community, (clearing throat) and there right in the beginning a pastor came to us with a family of four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And he said, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Can I join you? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Because I preach but I don't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I don't live really a brotherly life. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I have a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as a pastor and I have nice (coughing) income. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Can I join you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And one of our...we were three families, three couples who started...who came from the same youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And...uh...one family was more Christian than we. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And they said, "Look, go to the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> and learn there how to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And then come back and teach us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And they went and stayed...1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And then the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> was always concerned because they felt very much that we were seeking that unity, fighting for it....uh...struggling for it, but didn't find. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And therefore when the second family wished to go away...the second...another family who was one of the founders of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community...</span> they wished to go off the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We don't find unity. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It's finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And they were given the advice also to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> had already 10 years or 12 years proven that they have...could fight through to unity the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And so they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And they also remained in the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And so then they <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> came more and more interested in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> and tried to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And then they sent a letter to us...1933 in January, challenging us. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And on this my wife said, "That's the thing which we need.” </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I said, "I'm...I'm not quite sure about that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I for the first time in my life was asking God... start to say, "What do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">What should I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I got somehow a confirmation that I should go at least to find out what is on the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And so I come with my wife and a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We had Klaus, who was at that time 10 minutes old. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And then...in the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> I sat, so to say, in the corner and looked through like an _____ you know what...what's the matter here? </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And then I found out that the true Christ is different from the Christ of the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">That the true Christ fulfilled really what the Tennah_ said. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">It's not so that he was against the Tennah , but he ___ but the CHristians prosecuted the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That's a contradiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So on the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> , I found the true Christ, not the Christ of the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> and therefore I jorned. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Now at this moment, Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And Everett Arnold who had been...had been judgment of the war had also been led to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> he told us the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Hitler came out of power, and here he comes in at the Holocaust because the Hitler prepared the Holocaust so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And he said, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">This Hitler is preparing murder, deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We have to give a witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We have to give a witness of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Everybody that may cross our lives if we give that...everybody who does not wish to give his life should disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And those who wish to give their lives for the truth should stay on the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">A few left, and a few stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">About 120 stayed on the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> when Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And then we had ...soon had the raids of six police by the Nazis but they couldn't...they...they...couldn't still distinguish between Christian Socialism and Christian communism and political communism, because we are accused of being communists, you know like today. (</span><span class="sentence" id="303">Laughing) You know, the finest accusation. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And...uh...because we were living community, we were communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And we were told that if the communists come to power, we will be the first to be hanged on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> outside the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  The communists told?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  The Communists that if they would come to power, they would...we will be the first to have...be hanged, because we represented another communism which is not...uh...uh... political communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The Christian communism...you know ...you know, the first Christians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> were all Jews, and they lived in community. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They shared everything they had when the spirit came. (</span><span class="sentence" id="310">Laughing) So we say the spirit made them live in community, not they themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Not their ideas, but the spirit of God made them live in community as brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And so therefore, we represented that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We said also we have only one leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">That's Christ, and not Hitler, because Hitler was calling himself the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We didn't say Heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And we refused all the persecution of the Jews and everything and we wrote that to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We wrote a personal letter to Hitler and challenged him to not to shed innocent blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And in the end we said, "Look here, Hitler, what we wish you from our hearts is that you become of a...tool of the life of God...a tool of the life of God.” </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And we never got an answer to that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But we heard later that Hitler was asking when he was at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of a maneuvering nearby whether we live up there on that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So he knew something about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And we read...we sent also letters to the Gestapo to...to the Governor, to the <span class="BUILDING">Hinderburg</span> , to Hitler, to...oh...to everybody in the thing, saying quite clearly where we stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And then... uh...came the ____ which Klaus already spoke in which Hitler asked the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> whether they agree with his politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He had just left that League of Nations and...uh...we did not say neither yes nor...nor no, but we said, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We have to go a different way, and we challenge you. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We have to go a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The different way is to the way of Christ and not the way of...uh..what you suggest.” </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And on this 5 days later or 4 days later, we had 150 men with revolvers storming the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Hundred fifty SA, SS and people storming the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> , and we greeted them...said, "Good Morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">How are you?" (</span><span class="sentence" id="331">Laughing) And they couldn't understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They found it...uh...uh...cheeky. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They couldn't understand it, and they did not know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And because they expected resistance, I asked them, "Why do you come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They said, "We were...we were called up to raid communist nests, and now we found no resistance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And so they...in the end of the day, they took all the books with red covers from the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> as proof that you were communists (Laughing) and they left and said, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We forbid you to...uh...” No, I asked one of the Gestapo, "Look here, why do you come here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He said, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">You represent community and we represent community, but you represent community in another spirit than we. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Therefore, it's impossible for you and we forbid that you take any guests 1n.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We were forbidden by the Gestapo to take any guests. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And...uh...so then...uh...but we didn't...we didn't obey. (</span><span class="sentence" id="343">Laughing) We just...any guests we warned from that point, we say, "Look here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Ifa guest came, we say, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">If you are here, staying here, you are commit a danger because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you say, ____ caught with us_____ 1f you are caught with us, you will be hanged with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And so those who were fearful left, but those who meant it seriously stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And then secondly, they tested the children that they found that the children had no national socialist education, and they said, "We wish to educate your children nationalist socialist," and we said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We can't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We don't let you the children go.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And then we had adopted a lot of children of people in poverty or who...who father or mother has died, and they tried to...wish to take them away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And we did everything to keep them. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And...uh...for this reason, I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for...for the children because the children couldn't stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> I knew from the time we lived there in community and other community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French Switzerland community</span> , the _, and I went there to ask them and they first wished to educate the children themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I said, "No, we educate our children ourselves.” </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And then in the end, they agreed but said that they'd only take our children if the government is in agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And so I went with one of their members next day early to the government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> they said, "Oh, that's not our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That's the business of the federal government.” </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And so we went to them and they asked, "Why do the children wish to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we...I tried to explain to them quite clearly what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And they were...they said, "Look, why can't the children obey the government, the Swiss government?" </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And then he said, "Who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You speak Swiss-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You are a Swiss? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And when they found out that I was a conscious objector, they said, "Of these of your children we wish to have no nothing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It's illegal for your children to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ...uh...to find out whether there's a possibility for...in all Bruderhofs of the 16th century go in case we are no more tolerated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But...uh...I have the recommendation letter to Masserick, Tomas Masserick, the President of that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">A very good recommendation or letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> from a friend of his, but he was sick and...and his secretary...press secretary helped me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And they found out that all the old <span class="NPIP">places</span> were under the protection of the...law which protected ____ history. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And but they offered us <span class="REGION">lands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Luckily, we never had to accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and I had no news for a fort night and I didn't know whether the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> still existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So I went first to the Umslatz and I tried to find out and nobody could tell whether the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> still existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And so in the night I sneaked up the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> to find out that the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> still is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And it was still there. (</span><span class="sentence" id="377">Laughing) And I told my experiences, and on this a teacher...this ___ left the children for <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> illegally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  You went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to see whether it was still there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And find out that they're still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And then we were sent to Swiss, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , to find out what the Gestapo has in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We went to the...to the top...uh...directors of the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they...they found out that the cheeky, cheeky, to_ tried to find out of the Gestapo what they have in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And the man who had the whole thing in his hands, he read the minutes which he...which they took...uh...while they were waiting the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> , they took the minutes with them, and I brought the other minutes to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> by the way to bring them to safety not...the Gestapo asked for. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And there he read to us, "Look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">You represent publicly that the present state of Hitler shows most clearly the character of every state as the beast for the ____.
