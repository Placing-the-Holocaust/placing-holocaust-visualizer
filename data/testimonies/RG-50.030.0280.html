<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I am the third generation born in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My mother was born in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">She married my father from a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And my father was a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He made flour for the bakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Could you tell us something about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years, about your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> atmosphere in which you grew up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  As I was young, we didn't feel too much about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">There was a tranquil life, a nice, beautiful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Nice community life, togetherness, friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with non-Jews, Romanians and Germans, and I had friends, Romanian friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But then the atmosphere was changed and the Hitler period came on and everything start to change, by law, and also between the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Could you elaborate a little bit on this?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Could you tell me, please, what happened to you and your family once the war began, once <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started to lead their operations against the Soviet Union?</span></p>
