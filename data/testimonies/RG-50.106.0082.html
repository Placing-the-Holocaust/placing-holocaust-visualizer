<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Well, I can’t tell you exactly, I — well, my — both my parents were born and grew up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breisach</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , and th-their families go back for quite a while in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">November 18, 1997

<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  She is five years older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  So, would you describe your family as upper class? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I mean, your father sounded like a suc-successful businessman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  I guess everybody more or less describes themselves as middle class, and I'll go along with the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Yeah, I would say solid middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Both my parents came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rural town</span> — from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rural town</span> , and — but then, as I say, had this business, which was first loca — was initially located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> , in — where I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Did you live right in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or on the outskirts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  We lived on the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , let’s put it this way, in a re — in a residential area. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Was this in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , or a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , it was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> 1n a — one of the typical <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , cou — la- large <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , in which there were, I think, two or three <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , made up of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  I really don’t know, it certainly was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Since I left there by the time I was about six or seven, I really don’t know very much about the religious make-up of the <span class="REGION">area</span> , but I would say it was — it was a — a typical urban area, and certainly not a Jewish area.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  So you say you moved from that <span class="NPIP">location</span> at the age of six, so that would have been in 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Do you have any memories up to the age of six of the friends there, or anything that happened at that — you know, up to the age of six.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Let me amend that, actually was 1933, so by that time I was eight years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Did — and so you started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in that <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  I did start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in that <span class="NPIP">location</span> , went to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> there, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I remember quite well, I — I do remember c-certain bits and pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I can vi-vividly recall the <span class="REGION">area</span> , of course especially so since I’ve visited it since then again. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was — it was a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We — we had household help, and as I say, my parents — my dad used to be traveling quite a bit as a — selling for his business, but my mother was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  How religious was your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  I would say nominally so, for the holidays, and went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> occasionally, or on Saturdays, regular Saturday services. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So I would say sort of — well, how would you describe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  So did you observe the Sabbath, did you observe Passover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Oh yes, all the holidays were observed, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Did you have any Hebrew school training before the — up to the age of eight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  No, I don’t — not — not that I recall, no, I didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Was there a large extended family, either or your mother or father’s side?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Well, there was a fairly sizeable family, not in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived, but where my parents had come from, and that — since that was only about 20 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">There was, by today’s standards, a very close, nearby extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Of course, in those days 20 miles was a fairly substantial distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  So did you get together with them at special holidays and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Oh yes, we often did. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And in addition to that actually, one of my uncles, at times worked with my father in his business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Was your father very politically oriented, or your mother at that — at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  No, neither one, I would say, was either p — was really politically oriented or — or active.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And were — were your parents Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  No, they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  We spoke German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  So from 1925 to 1933, you were in this <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Is there anything else you wanted to say about that time, before we move on? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Wh-Wh-When you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , up to the age of eight, did you have any unpleasant experiences, or any unpleasant experiences in the <span class="DLF">street</span> with other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Ye — well, some, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I mean, we’re — we — since we left in April of 1933, this was very shortly after Hitler’s actual rise to power, there wasn’t really all that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Yes, there were the — there was the occasional bully, but actually I ran into that later on, much more so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Okay, well, let’s now move into 1933, and in January Hitler came into power as chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And so, how did that affect your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Well, on April 1, 1933, there was a boycott of Jewish business in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was actually one of the — the first centrally orchestrated anti-Jewish outbreak or outburst of activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And we packed up and went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , where by that time a ma — a major branch of the business was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So in 1933, we went — went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  So from 1933 on, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , or did you return?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Well, it was — it wasn’t all that cut and dried. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As best as I recall, we did not get permission to stay permanently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I remember November 18, 1997 we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And then we moved to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Again [indecipherable] across the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Okay, we’ll get to that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">When you had to move, what did your parents say to you, why did you have to move? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Here’s an eight year old child, how did they phrase it to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I really can’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But to my — well, it was an interesting adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I wasn’t that wild in — being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I was being pulled out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and off we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So I really — I must admit, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I do not recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Did this man Hitler mean anything to you at age eight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Oh, I’m sure — I’m sure he did, but exactly what he meant to me at that point, I mean, I’m sure it was not — I wa— I mu — I must have picked it up from — I mean, I wa — I was receptive enough, I think, to pick these things up from my surroundings, but if you asked me what I thought of them exactly, and — and what way it came to me, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  How would you describe yourself as a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Were you very independent, or —
ANSWER:  That depends whom you ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">No, I don’t think I was really all that independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I had a — well, I—I liked being by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was probably rather introspective, and like at that point already, and this came out much later, we liked reading a great deal, November 18, 1997 liked playing with construction toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">In other words, activities that are usually singul — done by one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I can’t recall ever having though, certainly at that time having a —a circle of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I mean, I knew people, but nose — no big circle of friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  So you packed your bags to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">What is — what di — is your sister’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Margot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Oh, Margot. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So you and Margot and your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Any extended family, or just the four of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, just the f— no, just the four of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  And you don’t remember this being particularly upsetting, having to leave friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">As I say, I don’t think I had a very large, or a circle of friends at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> is — 1s not that far from the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So what about the journey there, do you remember anything about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And then where did you first settle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Well, we settled for a while in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And after that when — apparently my parents did not get permission to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , or they — or thought it appropriate otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I must admit I never did find, never did ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We moved across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span> , which is in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span> , both my sister and I did, in a <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  What was that like for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Did you have any idea of the language in the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Well, you know you, a-at that age if you get thrown into this sort of environment — the people there obviously do speak German or a Swiss dialect, or a Swiss type of dialect, or whatever you want to call the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> — the Alsatian manner of speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And so — but French obviously was — was — was difficult, and we had a— we spent a limited amount of time in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> — in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  To the best of my recollection, un — until late — sometime middle, late 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In other words, about — I would say about a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Any — any unpleasant experiences there where you would — did they know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  No unpleasant experiences to the extent that I know now — that I can recall, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  And were you very close to your parents, did you have a very good relationship with them, or were they open with you about what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Well —
QUESTION:  Or did you not question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  A, I probably didn’t question it too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">B, I guess at that time already, my parents were under a great deal of strain, certainly a lot more than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And while November 18, 1997 one develops a certain type of closeness as a result, it’s — it’s not quite the same as a —as acloseness which develops in — in tranc — peace and tranquility.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Were you able to voice your fears to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  I don’t recall that I had any fears. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I suspect that my parents probably were anxious to — limited my fears to the maximum possible, so —
QUESTION:  Did you talk things over with your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  No, we were a little bit — we were apart — five years apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I would say that communication is prob — was probably more — even more difficult tha-than with my parents, because the — the — the five year age difference between the youngsters is — is pretty substantial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  So, after the year was over, then where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Well, in 1934, I believe it was, the French, having received a large number of refugees — at this point we had largely given up our business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and still had the business in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">At that point I believe it was that the French authorities basically said to the refugees in — many had settled along the <span class="DLF">border</span> here, that it was necessary for them to go inland a certain distance, or to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In other words, <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> along the <span class="DLF">border</span> was not — was frowned upon, or in fact, forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And so my parents really had a choice to make; do they want to go inland? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And is — if I remember correctly, I think the closest they could go to would be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merceuil</span> or, do they want to leave — and, November 18, 1997 which would of course made pretty well impossible the business — maintaining the business in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and while he — to a certain extent, the business in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , which was also very close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  So your father was still actively working at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Oh yes, we — we still had our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And so we packed up and moved back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And we did not move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> , we moved to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> , l-o-e — double r-a-c-h.
QUESTION:  Is that near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  That is — well, everything is n — well, a-again, it’s one of those things that today it’s very close, in the old days it was quite far. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It’s only about two miles from the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was about three miles as the crow flies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">In other words, they were all [indecipherable] or not, at the point where the — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> makes its bend, where the free countries meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was about, oh I would say, 40 50 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So we — we got back there fairly frequently, but it — it still — in those days it was a fairly long distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Was it hard going over the <span class="DLF">borders</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  No, it was quite easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">A-Again, for a time we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">guesthouse</span> , a — a <span class="BUILDING">local hotel</span> near the swi — again, very close to the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I would say — as I say, about the mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And then eventually moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">November 18, 1997 And that must have been either 1934 or early 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">By that time my sister did not come back, or came back and then she was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , a — what is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Boarding school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Boarding school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and she went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A place called Remy Achmont(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  And things started to tighten up, and Hitler was gaining more and more power. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Did you have a sense of this tightening up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yes, at that point things obviously started tightening up 1-1n — in many different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The business was still going, the German business was still going, although by that time I — I think the — the main part — we-well, the — or no, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There was no more business in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the business was largely in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and probably to a much lesser extent in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was a nice, large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Well, you — you — you — you begin to notice things like this, but one of the things, I mean, in — in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , anti-Semitism wasn’t probably quite as virulent as it was in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">In other words, the — in the s — in the southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I think people were slightly more relaxed, and I think this was true for quite a bit of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And — but yes, there were obviously signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I knew I was Jewish, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I went — first finished sec — f — well, by that time I guess I had — I'd finished <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> — <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> , I was then in the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">schule</span> , <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I had a number of friends, but 1t was — it was obviously noticeable. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">One didn’t count the certain problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You had the normal sort of bully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Such as? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Can you describe an incident?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Well, I guess bullies are probably pretty well the same all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">No, not — nothing particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I do know that after the war I went back looking for him, but he wasn’t there any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Did they call you names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  No, not that I recall, not that I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I was not, you know, a — it was, again, I was probably rather introspective, I was not very good at sports, so even if, you know, if November 18, 1997 you — if they chose sports teams or teams for games and so on, I was usually one of the last picked. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">However, I do not attribute that necessarily to my being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I suspect I just wasn’t very good at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  How did you feel about being Jewish at that point, when you know it meant difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  It was no — there was no resentment or anything like that on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I felt I was Jewish, and that’s the way things are, and I was perfectly — perfectly satisfied and no —no s—no special feelings about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Did you have any hobbies? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You said you liked to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Well, actually, at that point, mainly I would say I liked construction toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We — the family often went out for walks, that wasn’t necessarily what I would have chosen to do, but that’s what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">No, no other great hobbies. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I did have a — at that — during this period, I ha — which actually lasted for a long time, I had a neighbor, next door neighbor, a — a young, a friend, an Aryan, German, with whom I was friendly until we left eventually <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he joined eventually — he — I think he became a Hitler — member of the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But you know, that was just one of those things that one had to do, or did, and —
QUESTION:  So you felt comfortable in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> —
ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  — did you go play with him? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yeah, he felt comfortable in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I felt comfortable in his. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I had some Jewish friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> a mixed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">This was Jewish and non-Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, it was — it was the local —
QUESTION:  [indecipherable] public?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  It was the <span class="BUILDING">local public school</span> , and there was not a very large Jewish presence in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So it was — it was — I mean, I — I don’t know how many — I suspect you had less than one percent or two percent Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  And the tea — the teachers treated you well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  Some — I would say yes, I had a couple of teachers who were, I felt probably went out of their way to be nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">That actually came, I guess a bit later, but I had one teacher who, if you wanted to, I mean — I don’t know what — you know, I — I - maybe I’m — I’m in a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I — you can find anti-Semitism anyplace if you look for it hard enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">That assumes that nothing bad ever happens to anybody who’s not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In other words, you know, a teacher can be mean, or — or you can attribute to anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">On the other hand, they’re mean to other kids as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So, to answer your questions, it wasn’t terribly bad, in th — I had some teachers, a couple of teachers that I would have preferred not to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">On the other hand, I had a couple that in retrospect, I think went out of their way to be nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Was there a picture of Hitler in your <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Oh, there must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I’m sure there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Can’t recall, but I’m quite sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Did you have to salute him, or say heil Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  No, no, we di — we didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  So when you would look at a picture of Hitler, any specific reaction on your part?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Gee. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It’s kind of difficult to — to — wha-what one felt like at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Obviously I knew my — my folks were having increasing problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">This became very obvious, a lot more obvious as my mother became more and more tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">My father was perhaps somewhat more relaxed, but my mother certainly became increasingly tense. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So one picks it up, it’s not very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  How did it manifest itself with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Well, a nervousness, a sort of a— she, I think, developed stomach ulcers, had other problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But for instance for — I remember for stomach ulcers she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to get treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So it was still quite possible to go back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  And now it’s, let’s say 1936, and you’re just leading your life as it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Did you hear about the Olympics then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Oh heavens yes, that was — I may not have been very good at sports, but I’m a great spectator or listener, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  What were your impressions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  Well, I —I sort of had, I remember I sort of had mixed feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">On one hand, I was still interested in the German athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">On the other hand, you liked to see them November 18, 1997 occasionally get beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I — I didn’t — I looked at it purely or primarily as a sports event, not as a political event at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Did you sent — sense any anti-Jewishness among, you know, permission of athletes to compete.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  No, at that time I — since I knew nobody — what I found out in the meantime, learned in the meantime is one thing, but at that point I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I mean, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  What is it like for a 10 year old boy to see people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in uniform? </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Did you admire them, were you frightened of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Well, no, and obviously didn’t admire them. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But one had a healthy respect for — you can call it fear, or whatever it is, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And of course, starting about 1936, then things started getting tougher. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">As I say again, until 1936, it wasn’t all that bad in that part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  In what way did things get tougher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Well, then of course things started with °37 - °38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  What were some of the restrictions that you lived under?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  None that I can recall, that we had particular restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Did you have any curfews, or were you restricted to going to any <span class="NPIP">places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  No, but I suspect they was somewhere my parents felt they weren’t — they weren’t welcome, and we wouldn’t go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I certainly didn’t know of any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I mean, I — November 18, 1997 I — I was aware of course, then came the Nuremberg laws about then. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I was aware of those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  How did that strike you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Pretty weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You — you — you begin — I wouldn’t say one begins to accept it, but one lives with it, and it’s amazing one does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Did you think Hitler would eventually just go away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  I don’t think I had any particular feelings about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I mean, I would — I suspect, as I know a lot of people did, as perhaps my parents or my father did, and — but even that he — no, I can’t recall him expressing that, but I would — I wouldn’t have been — would — wouldn’t be surprised if he had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Jews were then classified as second class citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Did you feel second class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  No, no, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I was living in a slightly different world, let’s put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">A world that was not in the mainstream, but it was still at that point, normal enough to feel that, you know, one — one — one just lived in a — in another group, which obviously was being — was disadvantaged to a certain extent, or being — being — oh, how should one say? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Considered not quite on the same level, but I tha —
QUESTION:  But you didn’t feel yourself inferior?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  No, I definitely did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  Any particularly frightening experiences 1n ’36 and *37? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  No, not that I can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Things did happen in ’38 which were obviously frightening, but ’36 - °37, not really, no.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well —
QUESTION:  — recollection of that, or anything preceding that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Actually, preceding that, I guess I should say, I was sufficiently aware when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> was being — being occupied, that my antenna sort of perked up, and at that point began to realize that there were certain problems in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">In 1938 of course —
QUESTION:  Before we go a little further into 1938, I — I just realized that your Bar Mitzvah would have come in February °38. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  Yes, I— yes, yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I had a Bar Mitzvah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Please talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Well, it was a Bar Mitzvah, it was in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I remember I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Now this was obviously not the most important thing, but it’s one of the things I still remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Yes, and the other day actually, somebody showed me a picture of me at my <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> — taken at my Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So yes, it was the relatives, to the extent that they had not yet left. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Now, in the meantime I should say this: in 1936 or ’37, my sister — I guess 1936, my sister left from — came back from her <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , and then went off to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">My parents sent her to the U.S., and she — November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Ho-How did they get the — th-the papers to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  Well, we had relatives — by that time we had certain relatives that had in the meantime, left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And we had relatives who lived here long time, and she got her affidavit that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And so she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I believe it was 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We had some other relatives, an uncle who left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think they probably left in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">My mother’s stepmother — in other words, my grandmother, she left and joined two of her — one of her daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So the family at that point was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">In fact, the only ones that were le — staying behind was our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  Did your parents say why they weren’t trying to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Or were they trying to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Well, they were trying to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I think one of the key problems, of course, was having a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The Germans were very reluctant. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They were — they were perfectly willing to let them go, provided that they were sure that all foreign exchange had been repatriated to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and exchanged into good German marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And to convince them of that, of course took a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So I would say my parents probably applied for a — for emigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> probably in — I would — my guess would be 1937 or early ’38. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">One of the problems, of course at that point is my father had been in the German army, had been wounded in the army, earned str — in fact, he had been wounded three times, he had earned the Iron Cross, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And as the Germans were wont to say, the thank of the <span class="COUNTRY">Fatherland</span> , November 18, 1997 you can be assured of the thanks of your <span class="COUNTRY">Fatherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And a great many actually, I think, World War II — World War I killed a lot of people, and that World War II people, who felt that they were safe, because of the big to-do that the Germans always made about their World War I soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">In fact, the other day I ran across, in going through some of my father’s things, a certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">In 1936 he received a special medal, which apparently at that point was being given to all former front line soldiers in World War I.

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the interview with Gerald Schwab. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And you were talking about your father’s experience in World War I.
ANSWER:  So, in World War — as I say, perhaps among former German frontline soldiers, the urgency, the feeling that they had to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was not quite as great as it was among the general po — Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But anyhow, by that time, of course, then in 1938, a great many things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">By that time the — I think it was probably in 1938 that the French — the Swiss started restricting access to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">This is when passports were stamped with a big J, although that may have been in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I do know that my father started encountering problems of driving — of going into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">About that time, and again I can’t recall exactly whether it was before November 18, 1997 the events of November 1938, or after, Jews, the — the use of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> was restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">In other words, things started getting pretty rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">In 19 no —
QUESTION:  Can we back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I just was asking about your Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Were there any problems, did you feel any restrictions there, or were you able to celebrate it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  No, no restrictions, we celebrated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was not a big festivity, but it was — there was — I mean, one — one didn’t — you certainly didn’t do anything ostentatious at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But as I recall, it re — it was celebrated and it was — we had a —
QUESTION:  So you felt comfortable going to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and participating in the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">No, no question about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  All right, now — then Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Do you have any recollection of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  No — well, I have a recollection of it happening, and —
QUESTION:  What was your parents’ response to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  I’m not sure we talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I’m not sure we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Keep in mind again, parents at that point were somewhat wary as to what they said to their kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They really didn’t know — I mean, you were always — at that point, it had gotten to — by °37 - ’38, it had gotten to the point where one watched very carefully what one said, and had to watch carefully what one said. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Things change really substantially after around °36 - °37. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And therefore — well, parents obviously alerted their children, as my parents did me, what I should or should not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Such as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well, I mean, just watching what you do, where you go and what you say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  When you say watching where you go, such as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Well, you — you — you — you obviously did not go to large demonstrations or marches through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> an-and — and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Were there many of those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  No, not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">No, not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Except the regional Hitler Youth headquarters was about a half a block from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I remember Baldur von Schirach, who at that point was the head of the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Yes, I remember seeing him from a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The next time I saw him was 1946 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Was it frightening to see uniforms on the Hitler Youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Yes, at this time you became more wary, you — you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I mean, you started associating it obviously with — with certain events, things that took place, fears. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Whether you yourself experienced them, or others did. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">At that point you started seeing “Der Stiirmer,” Streicher’s newspapers on display all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> — various parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And so yes, at that point things started getting — getting a lot — lot tougher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  Did you see any physical incidents on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  No, except, as I say, my one personal bully. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But even that was limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But yes, I would — I can’t really recall any physical problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I do know that fairly frequently I November 18, 1997 would take different routes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , get out of his way and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I cannot recall they were being attacked, and I’m sure I would remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So — but you know, the-there was a definite fear there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Did you feel German at that point, or just Jewish, or both?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Well, I felt both, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Yeah, I would say you — you — you feel both. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You do — you — keep in mind, we did not have that large or active a Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">There was no Jewish area in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The number of Jews living in — 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you could count on — on — on a couple of fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I did have, as I say, I had one Jewish friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He and I got together fairly frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I would say I — actually I had two friends, one German, one — one Aryan and one Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  But there was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that was supported by the Jewish community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was supported, and we would often go to Saturday morning services, certainly every holiday, etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  What was Passover 1938 like for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Do you have any recollection of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Now you’re asking something that I really don’t —
QUESTION:  I was just thinking it was such a pivotal time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Well, it couldn’t have been terribly good, because at that point my sister was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , most of my re-relatives had left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">My dad’s ability to earn a living had pretty well shrunk to probably virtually zero, or certainly not much more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So it could not have been a joyous occasion, let’s put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And I November 18, 1997 guess we said next year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> probably with a little more fervor than we had in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  And then the summertime came, what did you do in the summer of ’38, anything special?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Gee. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I don’t recall any particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I was still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was still going to the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">As a small child, when we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> and probably early <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> , I used to go to a— a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish summer camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But certainly not at that point any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So I probably got into a certain amount of mischief and spent the summer that way with my friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  You said you had a Jewish friend at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Well, I’m — again, I’m quite sure we were talking about it, but it was — I don’t — I w — I would say it was one of the subjects, 1t was certainly not the subject of conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But he — he and I got along quite well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  Peter Wyle(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Peter and I got along quite well, we — we played together, we met after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">If I recall correctly, he went to — I can’t recall whether — he didn’t go to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went, I can’t recall where he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Were you a—a strong child? </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I know you said you weren’t that much into some physical activity, but were you — were you small for your age, or were you — look older than you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  I was a shrimp. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">No, I was very small, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Actually I was — any picture you — I have, it’s hard to believe at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I was very small, yes, and very — and actually the only —I only started growing about 1941 - ’42, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  All right, and then you started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the fall of ’38, and then comes kris — Kristallnacht?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  How much damage was done in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was — the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burned — was — I bel — yes, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I think was destroyed, it wasn’t burned or — damaged, trashed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  When you saw that, what did that do to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  Well, at that point, of course, one was getting used — not getting used to it, I mean, this was just one of many. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But more importantly, my parents left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  With you? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">November 18, 1997

QUESTION:  So you didn’t feel cheated out by not having to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  No, I did not feel cheated at that point, but as I say, my — my dad was now off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and my mother and I struggle along at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I —
QUESTION:  How — how did she cope with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Well, under — under the circumstance I guess she coped very well, but she was not easy to live with, and I don’t see why she should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I mean, you know at that stage of the game, the — the woman had a pretty tough time. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I mean, I had it tough, but she had it a lot tougher.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yeah — no, that was not a problem at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And then of course, probably — well, it was about the middle of December, about five weeks after, we — I remember vividly at getting a phone call at 11 o’clock at night, my father saying he’s at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and he’s coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There’s certain things that one remembers vividly, and this was one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Had you any communication while — with your father while he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  To get away — presumably to get away, in the event — because word was around that they were picking up Jewish males.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  So they though they’d be safer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  So they thought — so they thought they’d be safer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> , and of course, having previously lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> , somebody obviously pointed them out to somebody, and he was arrested on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And as a result, my mother, who was not a very good driver — we — well, actually, she was, she had to drive <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Come back by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , driving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which must have been quite a — quite an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">About that time my father was no longer able, even before then, if I November 18, 1997 remember correctly, he was not — no longer able to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> occasionally; my mother and I would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But of course, after that, no, that was the end of that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Well, at that point he was 1n his mid-50s. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">No, mid’40s, late 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So —
QUESTION:  Did he talk about what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Did he tell you anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  Not at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Again, that’s — you know, they wer — they — they used to be — there used to be a standing joke in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that where one man meets somebody who has just come back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and he said, how was — his friend asks him how was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And the fellow who was there says, it’s great. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">You know, they woke us every morning with — with Beethoven’s Third Symphony, and then we had a leisurely breakfast, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And of course his friend said, gee, that’s not the way my other neighbor tells it. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">He says yes, but he’s there again. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So, you didn’t talk terribly much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">This of course was the — th-the word — at that point things became terribly oppressive, and as a— as a— as a youngster you — you — you — you knew it, and you started — you lived with it, and you — that was — that was the — you November 18, 1997 knew you — one wrong step might be dangerous to you or to your family and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">An-And that’s — that’s pretty tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  Did you feel like a child then, or did you feel very old because of that tension?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Well, I feel I’ve really — to go to — 1n retrospect, I mean, we lost much of our childhood, after, I would say from — from age 10 on, there wasn’t all that much of a childhood — normal childhood, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We had one interesting experience about that time, and that is we had the Gestapo in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Now my experien — this is an experience that this was actually — may have been shortly before or after my dad was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We had our books at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we — they came in and started going through our — our books. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And they acted just like CPAs did, and it was perfectly — I mean, it was a —
QUESTION:  The-These are financial books you’ re talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Our fi — I mean, this is what — this is what the Germans were interested in, of course, in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And so, you know, th-they were in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they were —I mean, I can’t say pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They were — they were — there was no problem, I mean, other than uninvited CPAs, let’s put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, it’s another phase of what the secret police did, you know, it’s — it was the financial secret police, let’s put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Did they take the books with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  No, they just sat there and went through them, went down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They may have very well taken some along. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But then —
QUESTION:  So now your father’s back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Did his health improve after he got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes, we — we did have a non-Jewish doctor, if I remember correctly, who treated him and his health did improve, but — and actually, I think he survived that — both physically and psychologically, extremely well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Was that against the law for that doctor to treat you, the non-Jewish doctor, it was still okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  No, I Don’t think so, not at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And then in 19 — comes 1939, and about mark —
QUESTION:  Wha-What did you do with yourself, since you couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Well, I guess the same thing I did during vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I mean, I played, I maybe went to a certain extent, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">There wasn’t — I — oh yes, I did go to — I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">There was a Jewish printer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I did — did some part time work over there, trying to ki— my parents obviously try — I — tried to keep me busy, which was pretty valid. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And so I remember working — working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">This was a f — a family that I worked for, they had this <span class="BUILDING">print shop</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  So this Jewish printer was able to keep his business? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Yeah, at that point they still were. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">This however, may also have been earlier, just may have been in 1938, but I suspect it was probably in early 1939 that this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And then in April of — about April of 1939, I went off on the Kindertransport to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  How did your parents arrange that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  And you —
ANSWER:  We must have talked about it, they must have said this is probably the best thing you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It isn’t — since you can’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , there is no Jewish — no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> locally. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">There is — was no really that — terribly much choice, if you had a choice, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">November 18, 1997

<p><span class="sentence" id="689">ANSWER:  Stressful — well, until you were — you were across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , obviously at that point, I mean, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">You were stressful if — and —
QUESTION:  What were the <span class="DLF">border crossings</span> like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  I— nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I mean, it was — it was like any <span class="DLF">border</span> , 1t was a <span class="DLF">border crossing</span> in Europe in the old days. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It was a fairly careful control, but that was — that was November 18, 1997 something one was used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">In other words, the — the days of easy — this was not the days of easy <span class="DLF">border crossings</span> for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And so they would check the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> , and they would check the passports, etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  Did your parents give you any advice about what to say, or what not to say?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  Did you know any English at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I did try out a new word on one of my cousins, took me down to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I can’t recall what it was, we met some kids down on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in front of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , and I tried out another word, and that’s when I discovered that that probably was not the appropriate one, because he just hit me in the side of the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I got a nice big lump on the side of my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">My mother almost fainted when she saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">It looked a lot — I’m sure it looked a lot worse than it November 18, 1997 was. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But anyhow it — he taught me very quickly that words and language, necessarily — just because you know the word does not necessarily mean that it’s appropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Then of course, I think we stayed there about two weeks and then something happened to me that was probably of great value to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I had another uncle and aunt —an aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">She had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> already in the 20s, so they both had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in the 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And they were great outdoors people, they loved hiking. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And they took me, within about two weeks of arriving in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , they took me out for a two week hike in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adirondacks</span> or someplace, and told everybody, or every one of their friends to talk only English to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">So this was what we would today call deep immersion, and it was great because after two weeks I had a fairly decent command of the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">That — you know, the — it was — it was a little rough at the time, because you get frustrated in going through it, but in retrospect, or even at that point, I mean, immediately afterwards, or even at the time, you recognize that this is the way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And then things happened fairly quickly after the — went in fairly rapid succession. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I remember my mother went to work in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where one of my aunts worked, and she — that was her first job. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">That’s one the real, I wouldn’t say untold stories, but it’s one of the things that I must say we have not given quite enough recognition to it, although I’m sure it happens even today that some of these people make these changes and they’re tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I mean, adapted in November 18, 1997 ways that is unimaginable perhaps to us today. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Although I’m sure that a lot of ref — other refugees, refugees today, who may be doing the same thing I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Anyhow, my mother went to — did this — did — became a sewing machine operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Branch</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my mother and father worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family, with a New York lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And, now, it was amazing that my mother could do it, but the fact that my father suddenly became a sort of handymaid — handyman-chauffeur and jack-of- all-trades was also quite amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And we stayed there, I remember I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I —

<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  And did you work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> with them, or did you just go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  And any connection with family back in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">At that point we really had — no, we were very fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We had no close family in Europe any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We were basically the last ones to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I mean, there were obviously family and acquaintances, but no close family, and there was no contact with anybody any more, but —
QUESTION:  So then life continued on with you til you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="822">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  No, I actually had two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I — til 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">At that point my father prevailed upon the local draft board not to draft me because I was needed for farm work. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And before too long I decided I looked like I was gonna miss the war, which I did not want to miss. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And I went to the draft board and says, I’m ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And actually then was called up and went — went off in — in middle of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Joined the briga — joined the army, basic training, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Were you a citizen at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  No, I got my citizenship I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> while in the army, while in basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">It was a — a-any day that you could get out of basic training was a day won. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So, you know, it was great becoming an American citizen, it was equally great to get out of one day of basic training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  How did it feel to put on an American army uniform, after you had escaped from Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">ANSWER:  Oh, it felt great, it felt absolutely great. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I later on wore it back to — even though it — well, we’ll get to that later, but anyhow I — I did wear it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> , in the — even though that was in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I wore it in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Oh yes, it was — it was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  So you’ve completed basic training, and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  Well, then I c-completed basic training, I was supposed to go out and suddenly the army just ad — I was asked, just as we were shipping out to basic training, I was November 18, 1997 a-a-asked where my second pair of glasses were. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Well, the army had issued me one pair, but I had never gotten a second pair. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And I was heartbroken to find that I could not ship out with — with the people I trained with. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">They me — they were sent overseas and before long they were caught in the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I, on the other hand, stayed around for two more weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">At that time they didn’t have this one hour eyeglass service, otherwise I would have also been probably in the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I got, about two weeks later, I — my second pair of metal rimmed glasses, and I was off to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and became a member of the 10" Mountain Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And as I say, joined the 10" Mountain Division and was in the 87" regiment, E company, and saw combat with them in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">QUESTION:  So y-y-you were actually in combat, you said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="849">indecipherable] We ended up, after the war, or when the war was over, we were in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">We were in — on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Garda</span> when the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And about five days later, while sort of trying to recuperate from what had been a fairly strenuous few weeks, I got orders to go down the <span class="BUILDING">Fifth Army headquarters</span> , where I became an interpreter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  What was — do you think your experience in combat was different because of where you had come from, what you brought with you — you know, your experience with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, my experience in combat was different because we had a crazy command — battalion commander, who decided that patrols going out at night would be greatly enhanced by having a German speaker with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And regrettably, we only had two men in the battalion who spoke good German. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So either he or — or I went out in most patrols at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I mean, I — I would go out and patrol with our own comp — for — for me — patrol for my own company, and for other companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And then he had an accident and shot himself, or shot ca — shot himself through the hand, so then there was one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So I never needed to use — or never did use my German in patrol at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But the experience, yes, I had a few interesting incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I mean, one particular thing, we were the first unit to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Po River</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> and marching along either side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> with the — 1n — 1n — sort of in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , and I was at the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I must say, I didn’t volunteer for these things, I usually was volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And a bicycle rider came down the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , uniform, and coming towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And he came and came bef — I thought somebody was going to shoot the poor guy, because he obviously didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And finally I jumped out of the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and went up and in my best German stopped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And he started arguing with me in German because the 10" Mountain uniforms were very much like German parachuter uniforms, and he thought he had encountered another amer — German unit, and he was telling me that he had a very important message for the commanding general. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Well, we were obviously very interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And — November 18, 1997

<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  Did I that I know of? </span><span class="sentence" id="877">You know, war very frequently is, except for hand to hand combat, which we did not get into, war is very impersonal. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So to answer your question, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">But that wouldn’t have bothered me one iota. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">But no, we then, as I say, after the war was over, I got transferred to — I was told to go on detail to <span class="BUILDING">Fifth Army headquarters</span> and there I became the — one of the interpreters in Mark Clark — General Mark Clark’s staff.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="892">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I was translating actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I was — I was interpreting between them and you know, they’re pretty high level in the German army, and they often wanted to know why I spoke such good German. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I made absolutely no secret of it, and it was an interesting sp — probably the funniest experience there was, sitting once in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> between two — two generals, and at that time I’m [indecipherable] I mean, I had been promoted at that point to private first class. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And I suddenly burst out laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Now, one doesn’t do that when one is a PFC between two generals, but I — I burst out laughing, and they both wanted to know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And I said, well, it’s a pretty silly November 18, 1997 — funny situation, because the one man on my left was the German chief cha — chief chaplain of the German army in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and the guy on the right was the chief chaplain of the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And I basically said, you know, it’s kind of [indecipherable] to have a little Jew in between you, and you need me to get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So that was one of the more — that was — that happened during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">My German was good, but it was certainly not technically all that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">It was, you know, 15 year old boy’s German. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">But it got me into some interesting <span class="NPIP">places</span> like the German underground communications facilities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verona</span> , where all the <span class="DLF">German telephone lines</span> and so on came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Then one <span class="NPIP">side</span> you had the chief American engineers and the German engineers and I was in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Fortunately, when it came to technical terms they were able to — to communicate without me. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I sort of filled in the <span class="DLF">gaps</span> in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But I was there for three months, and then was transferred to a — to something called USDIC, United States Detailed Interrogation Center. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">This was a — an interrogation group, which at that point was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verona</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> we then transferred and we moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like — the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gmunden</span> in <span class="REGION">upper Austria</span> , where we set up an <span class="BUILDING">interrogation center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And most everybody in that unit spoke German, or a great many spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And —
QUESTION:  Were many of them refugees like you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I mean, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> didn’t have all that many people at that point who were pro — sufficiently proficient in English and German, and knew November 18, 1997 something about German army, you know, ger — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And the USDIC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gmunden</span> was set up to this <span class="BUILDING">interrogation center</span> , held VIP or medium VIP prisoners for interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">They were interrogated there, and we had a large number of <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I guess I’m not revealing any mo — anything that’s secret any more, but at that point, we had concealed microphones built into the individual <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , and I spent most of my time sitting with earphones, listening to these conversations, or recording them. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Some of them were — some of them were quite interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And so I spent — that started about July 1940 — or must have been August, I guess, 1945, so — in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  When you say they were interesting conversations, can you say anything about that, or you’d rather not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  Well, it got pretty crude when you have two female German youth leaders talking about their sex life, for instance, or — all sorts of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">QUESTION:  Did they talk about Jews at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  No, at this point they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Not — not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">There was nothing — it was basically material that you wanted to give — provide to the interrogators, to probe, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">QUESTION:  What was your response after the war when you learned of what had happened to the Jews, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had been opened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">ANSWER:  Well, at that point of course, we had — near where we were, we had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="925"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was not too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Oh, I guess, what can you describe it? </span><span class="sentence" id="927">November 18, 1997 Anger, frustration, rage, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I must say that this — I had great problems as far as the Austrian concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">In my book I once wrote that what took Germans six year — t-t-took six years to establish certain measures against the Jews, the Austrians were able to do in six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And it was — w-we got — the whole unit, I would say, got pretty sick and tired of being told how glad they were to see us, and how they had suffered under the Germans, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B

ANSWER:  In fact, we had a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gmunden</span> , which was alternately being used by the Austrian population, a <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> , and also for plays, and as a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> for the American troops, the 10" Armored Division was in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And we finally in — in —in—in the USDIC we finally got sick and tired of being told of how the Austrians had suffered, that we found a newsreel of Germans — troops marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gmunden</span> , and we told the projectionist to play it in connection, without any comment, in connection with the next time he was — had a movie showing for the local audience. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And it was interesting, it — word got around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> very, very quickly, and we didn’t hear this for quite awhile any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Then you stayed in that <span class="NPIP">location</span> for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  Well, I stayed there until December 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">At that time I got, on two days’ notice I was told I could go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> on R and R, rest and recuperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I had the requisite number of points. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">You — you were given points by — for — for overseas duty and combat and so on, and they were taking people back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> for rest and recuperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So off I went and came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , surprised my folks, and then went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">In the meantime I had decided I wanted to go to work at one of the war crimes trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And —

<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  Well, I decided it would be a fairly interesting closure. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I mean, it would be an interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And it would be the sort of thing I wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Now, I did ha — well, I -
QUESTION:  Was this from a historical prospective, or emotional prospective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  I would say both. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It was both. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But when I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and I remember I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , ready to get on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to go back <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> , I was told, I’m sorry, you will re — you can’t go back <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="954">He says, well, the — with the war over in the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , and all this sort of thing, the only way you can go back <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> 1s 1f you re-enlist. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Otherwise, you can’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Well, I wanted to go back pretty badly, I wanted to go back to my unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And so I did something in a moment of November 18, 1997 youthful exuberance, I re-enlisted, and signed up, and they changed the orders and they — I said, you — they — go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And I went back, came back overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> , and there they had me going to some other unit in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> or someplace, and I screamed and yelled as much as a — at that point I’'d been promoted to corporal — as much a corporal can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And they said all right, they finally — I remember, I think I had to change a couple hundred orders, because they had about a hundred, couple hundred people on — on these orders to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I had to go through each and every one of them and rule out my name; they let me do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And so they sent me back, they said fine, you can go back to your unit in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> I stayed at the enlisted men’s billets in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and this was — the gods really took kindly to me because when I was — I stayed there for two days, and I was then ready to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I tried to get my duffel bag, and lo and behold, it had been stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Now this wouldn’t normally be a tragedy except all my personnel papers were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">So I got some temporary papers, went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and of course I forgot to tell them that I had re-enlisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So I guess I’m a fugitive from — from — from military justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And got back to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , stayed there until — in the meantime I — I traveled to both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  This is traveled on your own? </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Was this your first time back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="970">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Oh no, oh no, I had — my first time back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was in — when I was still in —I guess probably when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verona</span> , so it must have been about August. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and | traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">At that point you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And —

<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Yeah, I sort of strutted around. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to my old haunts, met a few people who knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Noticed that there were a lot of people behind curtains looking at this weird American walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Keep in mind you’re in the fr — I’m — I was in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> , I did not look like a French soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Wandered around, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breisach</span> where my parents had lived and were born, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Met — as I say, met some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And then —
QUESTION:  Do any of them — any of the Germans whom you knew — who knew you before say anything to you, especially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  Oh yeah — well, you mean, before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes, especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breisach</span> and in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span> , oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">These were people who knew me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  Were they welcoming to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="986">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, those people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">The others stayed out of — I assume stayed out of the way because I didn’t run into any of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">The one person I looked for, I couldn’t find.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  Did you feel like you belonged in these <span class="NPIP">places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  Oh heavens no, I wa — I felt like a conquering hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">No, I felt anything but.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="992">QUESTION:  Did you feel very — very American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  Yes, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">About 150 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Yeah, it’s — it’s pretty heady for a 20 year old, you know, I mean, it’s — when a want — when you sort of run at age 15 and come back as — as a member of — of — of a victorious army, oh yeah, it feels very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">QUESTION:  Did you go about it — back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> because of your father’s experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  No, I went to — because the set of trials were coming up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And I went there and then I decided I would rather go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  Well, it seemed like the more interesting, more — historically more interesting sort of thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">QUESTION:  Was it painful for you to be at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> when — knowing your father had been there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  Yes, well, painful n — well, I don’t know whether you would call it painful, it was — it was emotionally wrenching, but not — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">But anyhow, I went back to my unit, arranged to get my army discharge in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and off I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  So you went as a civilian to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">ANSWER:  Yep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I left the army in — in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and — in May of 1946, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> as a civilian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">QUESTION:  And what happened when you got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  Well, you know, you were assigned billets, you were — they had previously gi — tested me, they had decided that I probably wouldn’t make a terribly good — which I agreed with — a terribly good court interpreter, or an interpreter in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , but they did decide to use me as an interpreter where you had consecutive interpretation, and I basically spent all my time either as a translator, which means on written documents, or as an interpreter working — well, here I should digress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">The Nuremberg Trials actually had 22 main defendants, but in addition to that, it had seven organizations which were on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Things like the SA, the SS, the general staff, the Reich’s cabinet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The idea being that if the members of the organization, if the organization were declared as guilty of war crimes, then members above a certain level, or maybe at any <span class="NPIP">level</span> , would automatically be considered as — as guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And now, since however there were too many people that either wanted to testify, or provide affidavits, or statements in connection with these things, separate hearings were held, in a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , before a public, but they were done in German and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And so you had, there you had, before a commissioner, the chief commissioner was an Englishman who later on met an untimely death as being a — he was a secretary for November 18, 1997 <span class="REGION">northern Ireland</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British cabinet</span> , and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> bl — got blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And so you had th-the — you had four, actually four commissioners; you had an American, you had a Britisher, you had a Frenchman and you had a Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">But all the discussions, all the ti — the — the testimony was in English and German, and instead of having immediate translation, simultaneous translation, you had consecutive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">But you had only one interpreter, so you — you had one person doing English to German, ger — and German English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  Wa - were these additional trials called the subsequent proceedings, or that was something else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  No, this was part of the first, main trial, where you for instance had — and you had actually then, decisions of guilt and innocence of these various organizations, like the German general staff, and by virtue of sort of concentrating, these were the people that were on — were being heard at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I spent much of my time working with witnesses for the German general staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">People like von Rundstedt, Kesselring, Manstein, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And —
QUESTION:  So what kind of contact did you have, or was this strictly during the hearings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">ANSWER:  No, this was one of the nice things in this, because A, the interpreter sat right next to the witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">These were not defendants, the main defendants never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">These were people that testified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Some of them were subject later on to subsequent trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And others then were, for instance, [indecipherable] Dieter Wisliceny, who was — November 18, 1997 was what’s his name’s deputy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Heydrich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">No, not Heydrich, Eichmann’s deputy was one of the people that testified, and he later on was sent off to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , where he was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">One of the nice things was that the interpreter sat right next to the witness, you weren’t separated by a <span class="DLF">glass wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">There was no microphone or anything like this, and you had — could have conversations with him during the break. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">In addition to that, your work as a — an interpreter usually, maximally you could do this for — it was for about an hour and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">It was fairly strenuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And you would sit — either you’d sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> itself, in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , or you would sit in a <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , and that’s where, usually, the next witness was waiting with a guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And so you could sit there and talk and — yeah, had some interesting conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I had — Kesselring once asked me, Field Marshall Kesselring, he and I, we — we sat there waiting to go — go onstage, and he wanted to know where I — well, first — first we — where I'd been, and I’d been, of course, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and he had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Now, slightly different positions obviously, but we discussed military strategy in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to the extent that I was able to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He then wanted to know where I’d learned my German, and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And his reaction was, well, that must be a great satisfaction for you to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And I said, it certainly is, Field Marshall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So, you know, some of these — Rundstedt once talked — gave his testimony, and he talked for — we had — we had told him, look, I can take about four minutes, five minutes maximum, but after that I can’t do any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And so he made a 10 minute speech, November 18, 1997 and then turned to me, and I sort of shrugged my shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And I turned to the judge, who in turn said, well, we can have the court reporter read it off, and then we'll translate it from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">The court reporter said, I couldn’t follow him either, I was hoping the interpreter could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So we all turned back to Field Marshall Rundstedt, who then said — gave the exact same speech, broken into two parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">It was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">This man — I mean, he — I wouldn’t say it was rehearsed, but he gave exactly the same thing all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So anyhow, so it was — there were some interesting experiences, the — the last head of the SA gave testimony about Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And actually, I prefer to call 1t pogrom of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And he was telling how the SA really was a, more or less a social organization whose main task was to protect Jewish lives and property during — during this period, during Crystal Night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">QUESTION:  And his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">ANSWER:  Miller. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Good German name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And he was — was going on, and then came the break and then this man really was hiding behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> when brains were handed out, because he turned to me, and he says, you speak excellent German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I say, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And you have to be — you have to try to be neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I mean, you can’t, obviously your — your — your job is to translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Well, you speak excellent German, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Where did you learn it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Or when did you learn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">So I told him when. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Where did you learn it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I says well, you know, I sort of learned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Where did you learn it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I said, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">When did you learn it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">At that point I couldn’t take it any longer, I said, November 18, 1997 up til 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Which of course was after the period — and he finally, I think the lights finally went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">This man had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">He had no idea what I — who I was, or what I was doing, or where I had learned my German or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">He just probed until I really couldn’t evade the answer any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But anyhow, so the —

QUESTION:  H-How did you keep your distance then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">ANSWER:  Well, you — you concentrated on — on — on translating and translating correctly, and that was difficult enough without making either sneers, sarcastic comments, or faces, or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">You — you had to, I mean, there’s a certain professionalism involved an-and I don’t think you — well, I didn’t find that terribly November 18, 1997 difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I mean, I may — might have had my own thoughts about it, but that was about the only time that I ever would reveal this to somebody who didn’t ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And even he did, actually, in a way he did too, but —
QUESTION:  Did you — did you ever feel that you just had to release your anger at these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Privately, to my — within me, yes, but certainly not that ti — no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">But then — but then, you know, at that point, they looked — they looked — how should I say, I — an example was in 1940 — end of 1946, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to see — to I— I — at that point I was already working on the subsequent trial — let me just digress a minute — and I went to see — went to Cherche-Midi prison, the <span class="BUILDING">French prison</span> , which a number of German war criminals were being held, or potential. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And I had to get a deposition from two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">One was General Stiilpnagel, who was the commander in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> from 1940 to 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">He — there were two Stulpnagel gen-generals, Sttilpnagel; one of them was involved in the — the attack on Hitler, this was not the one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I think the French eventually probably even let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">The other was hama — Helmut Knochen, head of the SD, who was Klaus Barbie’s boss; probably one of the most hated men in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ; the man who implemented the Night and Fog decree, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Now I saw Helmut Knochen before that, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> it was very interesting because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> the French prosecutor had a number of questions to ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And he would ask Knochen and Knochen, who, by the way, November 18, 1997 had it — a PhD in linguistics, would deny that he ever heard of this, and the French prosecutor, man by the name of Monterey(ph) would pick up a piece of paper and say well, is this your signature or not, and the man would say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And he’d ask him another question, Knochen would deny it, Monterey(ph) would hand him a document, says, is this your pre — piece the — is this your signature? </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Well, after that it was almost like Pavlov’s dog, because all that Monterey(ph) had to do 1s pick up a piece of paper and Knochen would admit everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Well, when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , here was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherche</span> -Midi prison — Cherche-Midi Prison looks something like a — we sort of imagined <span class="BUILDING">French prisons</span> to look in the 18" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">You — when you knocked on the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , somebody would come with a key about a foot long, and there wasn’t very much oil in the lock, and they would open it, and then you’d walk in, and then there’s a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of French prison guards and one of — couple of them were getting haircuts, in another <span class="NPIP">part</span> they were — some were playing cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And so you finally get to this guy, you get to the <span class="BUILDING">prosecutor’s office</span> , and they would bring in Helmut Knochen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">This was in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Well, they’d given helm — it was cold, it was December. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Helmut — they had given Helmut Knochen — they must have given him one shaving — one razor blade a month there, because he had a stubble beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">He had a French army overcoat that was about four sizes too big. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">He looked pretty sad at that stage of the game, let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He did not look like the sort of Aryan November 18, 1997 superman, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So now many of the — you — you could — you could — you had to maintain your distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">QUESTION:  Did you have to do a lot of research to do this kind of translating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">ANSWER:  Only on German military trans — when I did the general staff on — on things like military matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And there was a certain amount of it, and of course, the German language being what it is, where you can take any two words and make a third word out of it, you were very often — and in my case it was a lot easier than in the main <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , where they didn’t have time to think, but, you know, you — you — when — when a group like the SA, the Stormtroopers were up, and a word like wehrsport comes in, wehr means defense, army, military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Sport means sport, it’s things like hand grenade throwing, and forced marches with packs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">These were — these were like the — the military pentathlon in — in — in — in the Olympics, these were semi — quasi military activities now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And then you were forced to make a translation of that into English, and the translation 1s extremely important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I mean, you translate as military sports, and they don’t like it, because — but that’s what you come up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">But there is no such word in the English language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">So, you know, you try to prepare for it, but you never could for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I mean, you would — you would be blindsided every now and then by some phrase. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Did you have any contact besides the — wi-with these witnesses or defendants, besides the — the — the two incidents that you talked about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Did you have any other out — outside contact with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">ANSWER: <span class="NPIP"> Outside</span> , or <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I mean —
QUESTION:  I mean, when they weren’t testifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">ANSWER:  When they were not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">No, the-th-they were — they were locked up when — and I had no dealings in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">We did have one interesting case, and that was when one man came up and that’s where I get s — blindsided by the prosecutor who didn’t warn me in advance, because they asked him, do you know anything about the <span class="BUILDING">Gleiwitz radio station</span> attack? </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> — <span class="BUILDING">Gleiwitz radio station</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">German radio station</span> on — right on the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , and just before the war broke out between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there was an attack on this <span class="BUILDING">German radio station</span> by Poles and Hitler gave it as one of the main reasons for attacking <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And the witness, who was a member of the SD, German counterintelligence, said yes, I know something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Says, what do you know about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Says, I was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Well, no — there are times when you wish that the prosecutors would let you know something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">They knew what was coming up, I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I knew from history what the <span class="BUILDING">Gleiwitz radio station</span> attack was, but you know, this was the first indication I ever got that 1t was — 1t — it was a German a — attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I mean, you suspected it, but November 18, 1997 you never suspected to meet the man that was in charge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So, there — those times it’s difficult to keep a straight face, but you try, you do your best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">QUESTION:  Did you ever hear any testimony regarding Jews and actions against Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, certainly with Dieter — Dieter Wisliceny, as I say, who was Eichmann’s deputy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">There were a number of them, but D-Dieter Wisliceny was the — the — was the — the most important one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  But then, what did he talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">QUESTION:  What were some of the things he talked about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">ANSWER:  Ah, there I have to go back to my notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">But they were talking about that the — the — the Wannsee Conference, of course, the protocol — I’m not sure whether the protocol at Wannsee Conference had been found by that time, or had been located by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">But he talked about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">At that point, Wisliceny knew exactly what was going on, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> knew that he knew, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1147">QUESTION:  And again, were you able to just keep your emotional level down when you would hear testimony about Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1148">ANSWER:  Yeah, you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">You have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I mean, there’s a certain professionalism involved, you’re — you’re there for — to do a job and it’s up to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to make the decision, and regardless of how you feel, you have to maintain your — oh, how should I say, equilibrium. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">You have to be straight and translate it just as it was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Is your translation then, a part of the official records, part of the official testimony?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  Some of it 1s, some of it is what was retained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">The — the — there wa — it was a record made, of course, at that point, of the — four commissioners then made a recommendation to the main <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and some of those witnesses that we heard, were then heard in open <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">No, it is, but many more da — many more things — things that I did subsequently, the next — working on the subsequent trial where I abstracted documents for future trials, and I still run across those in my research every now and then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">QUESTION:  So you — you were working on the documents, and writing the abstract?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">ANSWER:  Well, this was after I left — I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> on the day — on the main date — the main defendants in the main trial were executed, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and then worked there as a junior research assistant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin document center</span> , working on subsequent trials, on prep-preparing subsequent trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And there, of course, you tried to identify mater — at that point your job changed, you were no longer neutral, you were trying to help the prosecution to the maximum extent possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And you identified documents, and wrote abstracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  How — how did — what were your thoughts when these wit — when these defendants were executed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  Oh gee, great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Was it a cause for celebration?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  No, I wouldn’t say of celebration, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">No, it was, well, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I mean, you — you had your own ideas about some of them, you were surprised at some of the — the — the trial — the outcome, but no, I don’t — I wouldn’t call it celebration, but you — there was a certain degree of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">QUESTION:  Did you sit on any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> — the court proceedings at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> — of the big — of the —

<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">QUESTION:  The main <span class="BUILDING">court</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">ANSWER:  Yeah, I sat in the main <span class="BUILDING">court</span> whenever I — whenever I wasn’t working myself, I would sit there and watch in the — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gallery</span> , oh yes, oh, quite frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">QUESTION:  And you felt justice was being done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">ANSWER:  Well, you wondered whether justice could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I mean, how can you — what — what — what does justice mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Justice means that an appropriate sentence or decision, or something appropriate to what had transpired, what they were guilty of, and that obviously wasn’t possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">But no, I recognize — I mean, the reason I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I re — I recognize that this was something which history would, rightly or wrongly, or — either applaud or not applaud, but would consider a major historical event, and there was — it was interesting being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Are there any particular defendants that you — that — that you remember, anything specific of any of these particular people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">ANSWER:  No, I mean, I remember all of them — I mean, these were people whose name I had heard for a long time, and so with the possible exception of Fritsche, who was the propaganda ministry de-defendant, who really didn’t belong in this group, because the people who did belong in this group either were dead, or they were hiding out, masquerading as farmers in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bavarian mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">He didn’t really belong, and he’s the only person I hadn't really — couldn’t identify immediately as to who they were or what they were and so on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">ANSWER:  Oh no, I was living in the — in an American or in — 1n a foreign co-cocoon there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">It was not living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I mean — it was delightful, I mean, the thing I went back — we — you know, when, for instance, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , you know, you stood on the — on the — on the — an apple crate, and you could look over most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and you didn’t — you felt this — this is just the way it ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">QUESTION:  You’re talking about the destr — destruction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">But, no, you didn’t — you didn’t live on the — I mean, you — y-you mixed obviously more than many other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">I remember while being in the army in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> I went to — I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> one time, and there was a show in one of the November 18, 1997 <span class="DLF">parks</span> , and there was a — especially one of the things, one of the — the acts was a comedian who was telling jokes about the war, and half the audience was watching the <span class="DLF">stage</span> , and the other half was watching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Well, I was in an American uniform, what was he do — this was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So you did — you did have a certain amount of contact with local population, but it was on a totally different level, I mean you — you did not feel you’re <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">There was no — no such feeling whatsoever.</span></p>

QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">ANSWER:  I don’t remember which — which <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> there was, but it was one of those things that, you know, they — they had to fill out a death register, and this was the way to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I mean, Germans were very precise and practical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Law requirement was to have a registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And they had one, but they didn’t want to spend all that much trouble, to invent a new cause of death for each case, so they make ditto marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">They gave the name and then a ditto mark under it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">This is where, as I say, so many of the — some devastating materials of that type were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Orders which were signed by officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">One of the nice things the Germans did as far as the prosecution was concerned, was that every leading official had his own — had — had an initial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Well, those are very frequently difficult to decipher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">But what was nice, they all used different colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">So if you saw a blue initial, let’s say, in the — in the Ministry of Justice, you know exactly who saw it, and if you saw a red one, you know who saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">So it wasn’t just you — you could identify the individual, and we’re talking here at the top level obviously, at the sub-muinistry level, and the sub-minister level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And this is where, in going through the Ministry of Justice files, I had an interesting experience, because having lived through Kristallnacht, I decided this was a good time to look at some of the files having to do with Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And the <span class="BUILDING">document center</span> had a lot of German employees, who we would indicate from registers what documents we wanted, or what folders we — what folders we wanted, and they would November 18, 1997 bring it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And one day this gentleman brought me some files, I started getting some files having to do with — with Herschel Grynszpan and the — the Crystal Night events and afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And he said to me, I see you’re interested in the events in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And at that point I had in front of me a — the future — the trial schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">The Germans had planned to put on trial Herschel Grynszpan after he had been turned over to the German authorities in 1941, after the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And two of the witnesses were going to be members of the germ — the embassy staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , namely — I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at the <span class="DLF">front gate</span> when he came in, when Grynszpan came in to — and the other was the clerk at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">information desk</span> who, in fact, took Herschel Grynszpan to see vom Rath, the German third secretary who then — and he subsequently went and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And this, of course triggered, or was used as an excuse for the events of Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And I — the trial preparation called for these two clerks to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I asked them whether he knew Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph), clerk so and so, and he says yes, I knew him quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I said, well, what about Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph) or clerk Nagorka? </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He was the man who — to whom Herschel Grynszpan said whom he wanted to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">This was a fairly important bit of evidence because of some of the — th-the arguments being made whether or not vom Rath was the actual intended victim, or the accidental victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And the clerk said well nag — clerk Nagorka, that’s me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">So that was a rather startling bit of information, but anyhow, he provided me the information November 18, 1997 that I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And this was a — basically the beginning of the — the beginning of my research for a book which I finally finished about 40 years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">QUESTION:  Well, I guess we can talk later about what kind of information he gave to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Well, what did he tell you at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1236">ANSWER:  Well, he confirmed — well, let — let me go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">The question was, did — at that point Grynszpan was asking — this was in 1942, after he had turned over to the Germans of ’41, he claimed that he shot vom Rath for personal reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And so the question was, the key question was, did Herschel Grynszpan ask for vom Rath in person, or did he just ask for a German clerk — a German officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And the answer, according to Nagorka was, he asked to see an embassy official. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And this was a key bit of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">QUESTION:  We'll talk some more about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">What else did you do at the <span class="BUILDING">documentation center</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  Well, we spend all the time going through documents, every now and then finding something of interest, identifying, writing abstracts, and sending them on to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">The — some of them were — at that point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , the medical trial was going on, but subsequ — they were looking for materials for subsequent trials, the Ministry of Justice, and various other ministries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And you just sort of — either you were told, or you were given advice where to look, or you sort of followed a hunch, or you followed something, so — something followed a <span class="DLF">trail</span> which suddenly November 18, 1997 opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">By far and away the mo — well, almost the most interesting or comprehensive trail led to the Reich’s Chancellery, Hitler’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Because every time one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight, they would send an — a copy to Hitler’s Secretary of the Chancellery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">So there you would have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I mean, when a peop — person like the Minister of Post got mad — or the Minister of Agriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him — accused him of having an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the Ministry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty letter, and also send a copy to the chancellery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So that — there was a lot of information obtainable there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">But mainly, you would stumble across something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">Or, they would — somebody would identify a certain event, and he — you would dig into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">QUESTION:  How did you get that kind of training, to do this kind of research?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">ANSWER:  [have got no training whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Let’s face it, I mean, the U.S. government’s just terribly short of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So you — you got into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">You — you had a more than rudimentary knowledge of the German government by that time, and you just sort of — there was no training for this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I mean, you couldn’t afford to have somebody sit there and translate this stuff to — for somebody else to analyze it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I mean, some of it — obviously the — some of the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , some of the November 18, 1997 prosecutors spoke no German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">So you translated relevant documents for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">But you know —
QUESTION:  So you didn’t translate everything you read?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">ANSWER:  Oh heavens, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">You only trans — you made a judgment and you translated what was import — what you thought was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">But you know, as they say, in the land of blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1265">QUESTION:  So that was a big responsibility you had going through that kind of information, and trying to decide what was relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1266">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I mean, sometimes you would — you had this supervisor whom you could ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">We had a — a former German, who is now a professor of political science at some <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in the <span class="REGION">east coast</span> , and he was our supervisor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">So you could go to him, and — and say well, what do you think of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1270">QUESTION:  How big a group of — of translators or — or researchers were doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">ANSWER:  I don’t know how many people were doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">I mean, we — we were a group, I would say that I immediately worked with about 10 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">QUESTION:  What other areas were you doing research in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">ANSWER:  Well, as I say, it — 1t — whatever the trials, whatever subsequent trials, I mainly — we mainly did the Ministry of Justice, where, as I say, we found out after three months that two months earlier, our main defendant had committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">But then November 18, 1997 his deputy was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Then you had the — you had the ... I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">I don’t remember who.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1278">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , did you see any of the well-known names, like Goering, or —
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, of course, they were sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> , sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Well, every time you went — I mean, they didn’t have much of a choice, they were all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">You had — you had — you saw them, obviously, on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">The only people I really got to know <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was Hoffmann, who was Hitler’s personal photographer, whose daughter had married Baldur von Schirach, the head of the Hitler youth, who was on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And she often — so she was with her father often, and I had the opportunity, I had permission a — permission to carry a camera 1n the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And so I would often talk to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">QUESTION:  Is this a personal camera, or for —
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Yes, personal camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Came up, had qui — made quite a few photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">QUESTION:  Do you still have those photographs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">QUESTION:  Do these people look bigger than life, or less larger than life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1291">ANSWER:  Well, you saw them in the context that they were — were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I would say for the most part they were certainly not big in life any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I mean, you knew that they were prisoners, you know they were on trial for their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">I would say the only one November 18, 1997 who — whom you might — not larger than life, but — was Goering, who — whose presence was — was — he wa — he was an imposing presence, let’s put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  What was your reaction when you, let’s say, heard he committed suicide? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Were you angry, or —
ANSWER:  Too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I felt —
QUESTION:  Too bad what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1298">ANSWER:  — that he cheated the — the hangman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">No, I mean, it’s — it was not anything — it was — I —I —I sort of felt sorry for the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> staff, who — obviously somebody’s — somebody was going to be blamed for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">No, not — no — I mean, how he went really wasn’t all that important to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  Well, let’s jump back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Oh no, you had also said that you had seen — you had said that you had seen von Schirach when you were younger, and then a second time in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Did he look any different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">ANSWER:  Well, he was a lot closer the second time, because the first time, obviously he had no — I mean, I wasn’t looking for trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">I just saw him out of the — out — looking out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And he was down at that — must have been about 1937 - ’38. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">At that time he was head — head of the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">He subsequently then became Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and so on, and it was in that capacity that he ended up in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and got 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">He was a lot closer then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1310">QUESTION:  So how long did you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> until about March, I guess, March or April 1947, and then decided it was go — time to go back, to quit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1312">QUESTION:  What made you decide that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">ANSWER:  Well, I decided I couldn’t quite go on having only two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , it was time to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And of course, I came back about the time a great many G.I.s came back, or were back, and had decided with the — thanks to the G.I. bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And so there was a great deal of competition for <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">American colleges</span> , which of course the attendance exploded as a result of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">But I— so I — as I say, ninetee — early 1947, I figured I better go back, finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Well, do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And —
QUESTION:  You had not had a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> degree?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">ANSWER:  No, I had two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And then I applied to a couple of <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and I remember I applied to <span class="BUILDING">Rutgers University</span> , and — but the one that I applied, that I finally went to, was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which would admit me without finishing <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ; they didn’t care, and that was the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">So in fall of 1947, thanks to the G.I. bill, because without it I certainly would — oh, I’m certainly would have gone to <span class="BUILDING">Rutgers</span> , which was out of state college or <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ; I was off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And spent three years there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">QUESTION:  And what did you study? </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , the old days of Robert Maynard Hutchins, you didn’t — they told you what you were going to study, you didn’t tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">It wa — it was an interesting situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">They — you took 28 ou — battery of 28 hours of tests, and then they said here are the courses you have to take, and when you finish these courses satisfactory, you get a B.A. degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And I did, and in 1949, I got my B.A. Obviously I picked up something in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Then spent a year taking — well, let’s see, I spent one semester, after finishing the college of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> , I spent one semester in the School of Social Service Administration, and decided that that was not the appropriate career for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">I had nothing against the School of Social Service Administration, I just couldn’t quite see myself working with some of the people that were taking courses with me, and then switched back to political science, until the end of 1949 — °47? </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">No, no, 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And in 1950 then decided to go to <span class="BUILDING">Stanford University</span> in order to — I wanted to — to do some research on the Grynszpan case and the Hoover Library of War and Peace had the best materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So I went out there, and then spent a year there gradu —
QUESTION:  Do-Doing research on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  No, no, no, I was — well, I got a second B.A. there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334"><span class="BUILDING">Stanford University</span> looked at my — the fact that it took me two years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to get a B.A., they were horrified enough that I didn’t finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">But the fact that I only spent two years November 18, 1997 getting my B.A., and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> , in order — the way to get your B.A. is to be in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">So I got my second B.A. there, in political science.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">QUESTION:  And then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1338">ANSWER:  Well, then something happened which — you know, you hear these stories only in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , something that I still consider amazing, and which I tell some of my f— my — especially my European acquaintances about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">The State Department put out a call to all the <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> and <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> for a special intern program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was invited to provi — to designate somebody for an intern program — or nominate somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And eventually, in early — you'll have to pass something called a JMA, which was a — this was during the time of the Korean War, there was a freeze on federal hiring, except if you passed this exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And you — the prerequisite was passing the JMA. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">Well, to make a long story short, out of the 22 people picked by the State Department, I was one of them, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And I still find this amazing, because there was certainly no need for this — the government agency at that point to pick somebody who’d been in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> only 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">It was ju —I just found it ab-absolutely amazing, because it was a special program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And so we came together, there were 22 of us from all over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And that’s how I then entered my first job, State Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">QUESTION:  And your career after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Oh well, let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">After that I joined the Foreign Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">I joined the State Department in 1951, joined the Foreign Service in 1955 — four — 54 — no, *55. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">1955 to 1957, I was assistant cultural officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , then back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for two years, 1960 to ’62. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The ama — new American embassy at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomé Togo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1354"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomé</span> at that point was so new that most of our mail went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lima</span> , because nobody in the State Department mailroom really had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomé</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomé</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">Then to <span class="REGION">eastern Nigeria</span> for two years, which at that point was on the verge of becoming <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Biafra</span> , just before the civil war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">From there a year to <span class="COUNTRY">Sierra Leone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">You ca — as you can see, I — I hit all the beauty sp — actually we di — we liked — we very much liked all of <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , with the exception of sieral — Sierra Leone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I guess we got a little satiated at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">From there, three years to <span class="COUNTRY">Tunisia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">From <span class="COUNTRY">Tunisia</span> then a year and a half, almost two years to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bangkok</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Thailand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Now, there was quite a switch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bangkok</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Thailand</span> onto a year at <span class="BUILDING">Cornell University</span> for a sabbatical, where — I guess you call it a sabbatical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">Then back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> from 1973 to 1976. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And at that point I was sent to — I was detailed by the State Department to an organization in which the United States at that point was not even a member, namely the International Labor Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">We went there for one year and stayed 10, and retired in 1986.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">ANSWER:  Yes, she is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and I met her through somebody with whom I’m — I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1372">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit now about your book and your research on Grynszpan and what — what — again what inspired you in — in the course of your research.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1373">ANSWER:  Well, it was an interesting case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">I don’t — I don’t catcha — I — I — the book, eventually I named, “The Day the Holocaust Began,” because I do feel that the beginning of the Holocaust, or — was with Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">It was used by the Nazis as an excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">But it was the beginning, it was the first time, really, with a couple of minor exceptions of centralized — centrally directed anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish activities in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And while there were obviously earlier ones, like the boycott of nine — April 1933, the book burning of May 1, 1933, but after that it was really these — most of the things that happened were locally inspired, or locally activated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">This, the events, once they got going, and even though Crystal Night was not centrally directed in the normally accepted term of the word — the wor — yeah — afterwards, it certainly was, and that was the beginning, to me, of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I — I found this young man — the story, of course, is that somebody, his parents — a young Polish Jew, living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">His parents had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> since 1911, walked into — heard — heard that his pare — he was living in November 18, 1997 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , heard that his parents had been shoved over the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">In — in late October 1940 — no, ’38, they sent him a postcard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , where he was living illegally with his uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">He walked into the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> , shot the third secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">The third secretary, after having what to the ra — to those of us in the foreign service can only call a meteoric rise, within two days he became first secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">But he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And that was then the beginning of the events of November ninth to 10", the night of the ninth - 10 of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">He was held wi — in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">Subsequently he said he had killed vom Rath because of the postcard he had gotten from his parents, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">He then was subsequently turned over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">They were going to make a major propaganda trial for — in which there were two defendants, world jury and in an — in the form of Herschel Grynszpan, and they were going to try to prove that the shot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> 1938 was the same as the shot of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> some 20 years earlier, in other words, that they had caused World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">The Foreign Ministry was behind it, they hav — had to have some excuse, they were desperately looking for an excuse for the outbreak of World War II.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1391">QUESTION:  So how did you do your research?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1392">ANSWER:  Well, the research of course, I — I did a lot of it — I got a lot of it at — at — at <span class="BUILDING">Stanford</span> , materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I got a lot of zer — not Xerox, Photostat copies of documents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And then in th — read an awful lot and research, got a lot of materials; for instance, as an example, the full Goebbels diary was at <span class="BUILDING">Stanford</span> , or the — the November 18, 1997 Photostat of the entire microfilm was — was at <span class="BUILDING">Stanford</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Worked there, and over time, eventually actually, later on went to — met with his — with vom Rath’s brother, who was a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiesbaden</span> , when we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Did — found the Frenchman who had done a great deal of work on the same thing, and exchanged documents with him, and this was basically how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I mean you — it’s a never ending thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And actually I had my first chance to publish my work in 1952 or ’53, when somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> heard about it, and I was offered that they would publish it, and in the State Department, being a very junior officer at that stage of the game, I had to — at that time it was necessary to submit manuscripts to a review committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And after talking to these people, they said send it over, I sent it over to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I had a document written. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And about four weeks, five weeks later I get a call back saying this is a very interesting — we’ve just made a couple of suggestions where we wouldn’t — since you’re now a member of the State Department, where it would not be totally appropriate, but we’ve marked the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Well, the document came back and it weighed about twice as much as it did before it went out because they put paper clips on all those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Well, they had a paper clip almost on every other page. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">And what had — had happened was that the French Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, at that point was go — who had been the French Foreign Minister, he was going to testify for the Germans, or at least so the documentation said, was going to testify in this big trial against Herschel Grynszpan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Well, by this point, mis November 18, 1997 — Georges Bonnet had become — 1950s — Georges Bonnet had become [indecipherable] to Franco-American Friendship Society, and it would just not do, saying that he had collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And without it, the story wouldn’t have made quite as much sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">So I put it away and kept it — kept it packed up for 35 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">QUESTION:  And then what prompted you to wer — t-to bring it out again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1409">ANSWER:  Well, when you — when you work and you — the people usually ask you what are you going to do afterwards, you say you’ll write a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And then when finally it comes you retire, you gotta put up or shut up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1411">QUESTION:  Did you learn a tremendous amount by doing this research? </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Did you come to conclusions you didn’t think you’d be coming to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1413">ANSWER:  Yes, very definitely did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">The biggest conclusion — first of all yes, you obvi — I obviously did a great deal of research into the era, into the life of the Polish Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I mean, here’s — here are — here are people that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1911. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">In 1938 they’re shoved across the <span class="DLF">border</span> as Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">You learn about why they were pushed across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and here you can attribute that to the actions of the Polish government as much as to the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">It’s a story that’s not too well known, but the fact of the matter 1s, 1t was — 1t was provoked by the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">But the biggest thing that I think I learned is that to me Herschel Grynszpan to start with, was an assassin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">I don’t like assassins, for any reason, regardless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And I was not November 18, 1997 terribly favorably well disposed towards him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I learned two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">One, before his probable death — in other words, we still don’t know exactly where he died, although we have a pretty good idea — this young man, from becoming a young, hot-headed assassin, became a true hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Secondly, whatever damage he did an — to Jews, which resulted in Crystal Night, I think he saved many more lives, or his act saved many more lives than the — the — the death that he caused; for the very simple reason that immigration of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> started high in 1933, went down through 1937, early °38, and then immediately after Crystal Night, immigration shot up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">So a lot more people left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a result. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">So in the end, he really — his act really saved lives, even though 110 - 115 people died in the immediate aftermath of Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">This is tape number three, side B. The book, and the research on the Grynszpan case, and when you did your research, did you interview his lawyer, or did you interview other people, and — and did you interview other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  I interviewed a number of people, I interviewed the psychiatrist, the German psychiatrist who examined him on behalf of the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">In fact, I visited him in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1431">QUESTION:  His — his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1433">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1434">QUESTION:  That’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1435">ANSWER:  I interviewed his lawyer —
QUESTION:  Did — did you learn anything from the psychiatrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1436">ANSWER:  No, I got his medical opinion, which was reinforced by the documentation we found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">He found — he found him a sla — somewhat o — more than average intelligent young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Quite mature for his age, but at that point, of course, he had been in German hands for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I should say this, that he was treated very well by the Germans, because he was a special prisoner, they wanted him for a big show trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">He — and while in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> he was allowed to keep his hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">He usually worked in — worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> on food distribution, which means that wherever he was imprisoned, he had enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">He was not, as far as I can tell, mistreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And when the trial finally opened, a decision finally was made to postpone the trial indefinitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">Hitler personally described him, or said that he was his personal charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">In other words that nothing was to happen to this young man without Hitler’s personal decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Now, it probably — whether it — whether it finally did happen, November 18, 1997 happened with Hitler’s knowledge or not, a — chances are he died at the — towards the very end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">He survived most of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">But let’s see, we interviewed — or I interviewed vom Rath’s brother, I interviewed Moro-Giafferi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Moro-Giafferi was the French criminal lawyer who was hired by Dorothy Thompson and a journalist group to defend Herschel Grynszpan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">And him I saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 1946 — 40 — late — in December of 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">QUESTION:  Did he give you any insights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1452">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">He was, as far as I’m concerned, he cracked the case in — as to what the — the subsequent argument or this — the — what the — the argument that Grynszpan used to avoid a trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan avoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan on the world stage, on trial — for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite the main newspaper people from around th-the — the <span class="REGION">neutral Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">They — it was a big to-do — was to be a big propaganda trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">They had built a special <span class="INT_SPACE">courtroom</span> [indecipherable] new <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">It was to be a big to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">And Herschel Grynszpan finally announced t — before — shortly before the trial was to take place, that he had killed vom Rath because vom Rath had made homosexual advances to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">Now, obviously homosexuality is not what major propaganda trials are made of, especially if the victim was supposedly involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">Well, when I finally did speak to hersh — to Moro-Giafferi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , he — by the way, he was a— a man about five foot November 18, 1997 tall and five foot wide, who when I saw him the first time, greeted me with the statement that he had ever — only ever lost one man to the guillotine, and that was Bluebeard, and — which I said could be forgiven. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">And he was the number one criminal lawyer in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in — in the 20" century; certainly the first half of the fu — 20" century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every — every major criminal trial, especially murder trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he says, well, let me explain where he got that idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">He says, when I initially took up his defense — and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point was a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when foreign correspondents were still major figures, in — in the days when you didn’t have instantaneous CNN coverage and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">He said, I told — I asked Herschel why he had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what happened to his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And I explained that this matter — Moro-Giafferi speaking — I explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards political crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much more lenient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able to confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that there was a homosexual connection between the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Well, according to Moro- Giafferi, Grynszpan rejected this out of hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">But then a few years later 100November 18, 1997 remembered it, used it, and basically said to his cellmate, they’re not going to make me — make another show trial out of me, they’ve done enough damage already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1470">QUESTION:  What did you — what did you want to accomplish by doing this research and writing this book?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1471">ANSWER:  Well, I just wanted to put it on paper, and put it in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">I don’t think it’s that terribly important, because if that hadn't happened, something else would have triggered what happened subsequently, where there would have been a Kristallnacht, it probably would have happened differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">But I certainly don’t think that Herschel Grynszpan caused it; he was the excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And so I don’t consider this book as you know, that terribly important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">It’s — to me it’s an interesting footnote to history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">I don’t over — don’t want to overdramatize the importance of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">It’s — it’s an interesting — it’s a fascinating life, it’s an interesting individual, certainly the way he turned out to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And as far he — he — I have the utmost respect for him, and I felt his story needed to be told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1479">QUESTION:  And is your book the definitive book on this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1480">ANSWER:  Until the next one comes out, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1481">QUESTION:  Can we talk now about some general questions? </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Do you think you’re a different person today because of what you went through as a young — young boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1483">ANSWER:  Oh heavens, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1484">QUESTION:  In what way”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">101November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  In every which way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">I mean, you — you — you — you can’t help but be affected by these events. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">I mean, if I had had a normal childhood, if I’d had different acquaintances, yes, of course we’re all — we’re all changed a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">I’ve no idea what we would have been like otherwise, but there’s no question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">We’re more — I think more introspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">We — we have a different view of life, more serious view of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">No doubt about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1492">QUESTION:  You had said earlier that you lost part of your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Do you think you ever got it back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1494">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think you can — there’s no way that you can get it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">And you know, it’s gone, but nerit — you — you — you — it — it — it affects you and it changes you and — and then also, keep in mind it’s not just what happens to you, it’s also what happens to the people who — that you associate with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">For instance, the people that surround you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">I mean, as an example, my wife lost both her parents at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">Being associated with some — with these people, the more immediate victims, undoubtedly affects you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">On the other hand, at the same time, of course, you appreciate much more what you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">And I think that’s of — that’s a positive side of it, that you — you are much more appreciative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">You realize what life can be like and what life is like now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">So there are both negative and I guess, in a way, indirectly certain positive aspects to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">But change, a change that, for all of us, are — are profound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">Or the — the — that the attitudes, or the — the — our feelings and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">102November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  You went through a difficult time when you had to leave your parents and you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and you were by yourself with those two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">When your children became that same age, did that bring back that time to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Is that a difficult time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1508">ANSWER:  Yes, it — it — it certainly — it certainly affects you, you certainly think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I remember sitting, of all the — of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , it really hit me when I saw “Der Ring,” Wagner’s Ring, where Wotan leaves his daughter surrounded by a ring of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">It really hit me right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">So yes, there are — there are many times, and you try to guard your children, of course, from that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">One of the things I do when I do inscribe my book on the Holocaust, or, “The Day the Holocaust Began,” I usually write, may our children never fully understand what is written in this — what is written here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So you try to protect them, but 1-1t undoubtedly affects your life, your attitude, your habits. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">The whole — your outlook on life, oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1515">QUESTION:  What kind of habits are affected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1516">ANSWER:  Well, I we — as I say, I would say mostly — habits maybe is not most — best word, but your — your — the way you view life and the way you live life and the way you take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">The way you either appreciate it — appreciate it, or the attitude that you have to life, it affects, 1-1t’s — it permeates everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1518">QUESTION:  Is it always on your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">103November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  No, not necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">No, but it has shaped your mind, it has shaped your thought, and that 1s where the change then comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">No, it’s not constantly on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">If it is I would be at — then it would be primarily negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">But it has changed your mind, and that is where it comes in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1524">QUESTION:  Are there any other s-sights or sounds that trigger your childhood experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1525">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1526">QUESTION:  You mentioned the opera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1527">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">Well, no, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">It’s — it may very well actually, you know, you do think of it at ra — strangest times, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">But to — to — you can’t really describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">It’s something that happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">It’s not the same thing that triggers it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">But yes, it — it’s brought forth by all sorts of things, whether it’s a— a book that you read, a—a picture that you see, a—a-—a story that you hear, all sorts of things can trigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">Because it — while it may not be foremost in your mind, it certainly 1s very close to the surface, it’s bound to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1535">QUESTION:  Did you join the foreign service — did that — did the inspiration to join the State Department Foreign Service come from, in any way, from your experience of being born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”

QUESTION:  What was that — what I meant was it — was that purely intellectual, or because you had seen tyranny firsthand, did it inspire you to try to make a difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1537">ANSWER:  No, na— na — I wouldn’t — it can’t — I don’t think it’s possible I — my case, to trace it to that, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">It’s — it was — 1t was an interest in — like intellectual interest and knowledge of — of European history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">And interest of — well, I mean, it’s —-I—I-I don’t think — I haven’t really thought about this, I don’t think that it 1s traceable back to my experiences as a youngster.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1561">ANSWER:  Well, on the Days of Remembrance book, it depends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">I haven’t right now, since there’s a change, I’m not working with them now, but we have been doing various things on the Days of Remembrance book that’s on the chronology, for year by year chronology of what happened where. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">Then we have recently done some work in connection with the claims by American soldiers at — or Americans who are seeking restitution from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for incarceration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">And so there’s a question of definition, what is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , because it’s not always clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">106November 18, 1997 So we’ve been making — this 1s the Justice Department, we’ve been helping the Justice Department on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">So there’s a wide variety of things.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Both Jewish and non-Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1616">ANSWER:  Well, let me say this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">I — I have the feeling that being — I n —I know there are a number of survivors — first of all, of course, I have trouble with the word survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">I do not consider myself a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">I know people who’ ve been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> ; they’re survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">Then of course then, I am not a survivor, I’m a— I’m a refugee, you can call any sort of thing, but survivor, I don’t feel I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">Then, of course, then there’s the — the group in between, and that is, for instance, my wife, who is out — who was never in a conce — went to — to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in a — in a children’s transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">Had a much tougher time, and of course, most of all, lost her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">Does she belong in the survivor cat — she doesn’t consider herself to be a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">It’s —1t’s very difficult, but to me, the — I don’t think there’s any question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">To my wife’s cousin, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , or was in — 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , no question either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">It’s that in-between, gray area. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">110November 18, 1997 That’s one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">The second point 1s, I don’t think that by virtue of being a survivor, you become an expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">No, quite frankly, I’ve — I’ve made myself very unpopular already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">I mean, I’ve only attended one survivor group so far, and I’ve made myself unpopular [indecipherable] by basically saying, just because somebody’s a survivor, they don — does not mean that they’re necessarily the best guides. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">So ve been accused since then of being an academic, or being too — too feeling that you have to have university degree and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">Which isn’t, of course, at all what I’m talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">I’m just saying that, being the be — being the best guide, or a guide, it’s interesting to be able to say to a group, this person lived through it, but that does not make that — that’s important, but it doesn’t make necessarily a — a qualified guide, or the best guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">There might be somebody who had no connection with it, and yet still is able to do a great job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">So, I have a — perhaps a slightly different point of view than some of my fellow volunteers.</span></p>
