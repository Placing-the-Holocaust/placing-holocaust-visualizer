<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Because he was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  In part because he was Jewish and also there were very few jobs for Semitic experts and I’m not sure exactly how much the anti-Semitism at the time played a role in his not being able to find a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But my mother was very able in many ways and she ran a <span class="BUILDING">textile store</span> and he helped her with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So they sort of did it together, but my mother was the driving force behind the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , which her father I think helped — her father helped all the — she had seven brothers and sisters and all of them came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And so he, my grandfather sort of engineered for all of them to go into what I call the shmata business. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It’s really textiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">https://collections.ushmm.org July 23, 2014

QUESTION:  This was 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  This was 38. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">This is actually before I was eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In March 1938 the Germans essentially annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and we were <span class="NPIP">within</span> , and Hitler gave a speech the next day on the <span class="DLF">northwest Bahn Platz</span> and we could see him from our <span class="DLF">window</span> , except there were SS men all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> to keep people from being at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I would go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I would be shooed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So I have a vivid memory of that event and I remember you know these swastika banners that they had and I can’t even look at them now, you know with that, so that was an early memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I was already eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I have earlier memories of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to which was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88"><span class="BUILDING">Ancostalitz Gasse</span> which was a <span class="DLF">street</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I remember the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We lived near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Altgarten</span> which is a famous <span class="DLF">park</span> in the, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> which still stands and various things that happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So I remember and I guess I also remember we used to go to a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> when I was four or five called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Véslau</span> , V-O umlaut — S-L-A-U, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And we used to go there in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I have memories of that too, learning to swim which we weren’t allowed for three years later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I forgot how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I didn’t realize I had forgotten it and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> and I jumped in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pool</span> and I sank. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was told you never forget how to swim, but you do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Hitler came into power in 33 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Obviously you were too young to know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Was your first knowledge of him when they annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">https://collections.ushmm.org July 23, 2014
ANSWER:  When they annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Up to your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Was it a happy childhood, or did you experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  I think up to that point, my childhood was pretty happy and I experienced anti-Semitism only very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  As a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  As a young child because we lived in a sort of they called it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leopoldstadt</span> , which is a largely, it’s the second bitserk, or district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and there was largely Jewish populated so I didn’t encounter too many gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  So it was an entirely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  That’s right at that point, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So I didn’t —

<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Did you like sports when you were a little boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was not, I was more interested in books than sports and I had a stamp collection. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I remember I had a collection mania which I think very young kids sometimes have and I was collecting stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In my last memory of leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and had a kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , you know a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">What do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You know you heated it with wood or coal oil, what it was and I remember my mother https://collections.ushmm.org July 23, 2014 saying I could not take my paper soldiers with me and I, the last thing I remember is seeing them burning <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You know kids have these memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Devastating. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Were you close to your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Yes, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We had —
QUESTION:  Played together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  We even had a language of our own and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">In fact, she was sort of the dominant one. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Pll show you a picture of the two of us when we were six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I have it up over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And Pll show it to you later if you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so we were very close and as I said, as twins sometimes too, they develop a language of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And she was, it was, she was more forceful than I was and she sort of, she dominated the relationship you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we had a game playing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We each had special names for each other and it lasted a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Instead of when I see her now, we used to make faces like this and it was what we called it a nuchi face and for many years we would still do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It’s just built in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Would you say you were an independent child up to the age of eight, granted life changed at eight years.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  The myths?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  The myths when I was six or seven years old and I remember reading it and actually it paid dividends because well there was a picture of Hercules in this book and it showed him you know with a big muscle bringing in the skin of Nimean lair or something for some guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And it was sort of a model, a role model for me of a strong man. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Had several, like these strong men would come to my rescue if anything bad happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was a fantasy but I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So I was not sports minded at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Jewish kids of that period were relatively not sports minded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Now comes 1938, March 38. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And you described, and you saw Hitler.</span></p>

QUESTION:  How did you know who this man was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yes, I knew —
QUESTION:  How did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well I think I must have read about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I must have learned that <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was going to be annexed, that the Germans were invading <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , coming in or being invited in. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I must have heard that a few days before and, I must have been aware that bad things were happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Were you frightened, do you remember — it being a frightening time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  I was frightened somewhat later. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">No, but I mean in that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I was very frightened, sometime in the spring of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My father, I went along with my father to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> but it wasn’t the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> we usually went. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Maybe that <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> had been closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And when we came out there were SS people waiting to corral the people who come out and take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But my father was with me and since he had a small child with him, they let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So then I knew that things were very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And were getting worse and it was, you had asked me when I became very aware of it after the annexation. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And then my feeling was that the Austrians were as, more anti- Semitic than even the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Were there any creeping restrictions before 38, before the spring of 38?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Not that I was aware of but I’m sure there were because I think people could no longer teach at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I’m sure there were lots of restrictions of which wasn’t aware of, aware of them as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Here you are and you see this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Do you remember any visceral feelings on seeing him? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">https://collections.ushmm.org July 23, 2014
ANSWER:  No, I— I went to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and it was just, it was a fleeting second before the SS men chased — they stationed themselves at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They came to all the surrounding —
QUESTION:  What <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> were you on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  We were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They came to all — so we were high enough to sort of take a shot at him if we had a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So they were guarding Hitler in the surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> by going to the high <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and watching the <span class="DLF">windows</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Did they actually come upstairs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Yes, they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I’m trying to explain to you.</span></p>

id="543">So she remembers some things that I have forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So she wises me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So anyway so we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I mean we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">To this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vila Formosa</span> , which is also I remember it pretty clear because for two items. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I write about one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">One 1s that we didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But we played a lot with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And with a couple of other Luxembourg kids named Monique and Roger. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I still remember the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They were the children of very wealthy <span class="BUILDING">Luxembourg store</span> owners who also had become refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And so we met them there and we spent a lot of time palling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And I remember this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> stored cork boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="556"><span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> is a cork producer and they were 20 feet high and we would bounce around among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It was very innocent play, I still remember those. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The other thing that I remember is that at one time, a British sailor came into the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="560">And he had made his way from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> hoping to go actually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> to sail back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And he sort of took us under his wing and my sister and I maybe some of the other, went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We walked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And at that time I was obsessed with getting a sling shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I guess it was sort of David and Goliath. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And I had, the interesting thing is that I found the fork, a piece of wood that could serve as a fork and I had a rubber band which I could use to tie. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But I didn’t have a little piece of leather that you could use for putting a stone in when you — and I mentioned this to this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I’Il never forget what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">He had a pocket knife because it’s one of the things he saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And he bent down and unlaced one of his shoes and he cut off the tongue and he gave it to me to use as a— I think I wrote an essay once but I never finished it called a gift of tongue about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I didn’t know his name so I lost sight of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There are others, these things that you remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So anyway, eventually we got to, we were allowed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Porto</span> , <span

spent four or five months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oporto</span> and that was memorable for various reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">One of them was that I became more aware of women https://collections.ushmm.org July 23, 2014 or girls will I say and I fell in love with Olivia De Havilland for a peculiar reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Somehow, I guess we were pretty cute kids and the owner of one of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> not far from where we lived, knew we would like to go to the movies and he arranged for waiters to take us, Erika

this Plaza de la Libertad, that was the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And we would got to his <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and the guy would send a waiter with us and we could go to any movie that we wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So we went to the movies as often as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Although we didn’t understand the language, a lot of it, I didn’t realize til much later I was living in a fool’s paradise, cause they were showing Superman, Batman, a lot of the American serials. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But we saw them as a continuous movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I didn’t realize that when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> I realized they had the same stuff but only got 15 minutes so there was an explosion and you come back the next week to see the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But we saw all these movies and we also saw Robin Hood. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And there was Olivia De Havilland with her long tail and so I fell in love with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I’m sure I’m not the first one with
