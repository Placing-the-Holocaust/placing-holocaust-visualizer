<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER: About what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION: Your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER: Well, I had a very happy childhood, although I was born before the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I remember...during the war, I must have been a little bit over three years old and my father was in the army, in the Austrian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And my mother--with my...with her sister, with my aunt--brought me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from where she came in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> ; because her mother-in-law, my grandmother, was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She [his grandmother] died. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Then her husband, my grandfather, got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And then I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I remember still, very dimly, the day when we came from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Well, anyhow when I https://collections.ushmm.org got sick my mother told the doctor, "Dr. Weiss, this is an infectious diseases, because my mother-in-law passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Now the father-in-law is sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And now the...my child got sick." </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They finally found out it was typhoid fev...fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And... uh... also remember during that sickness that my aunt coaxed me in eating, after the fever was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And...uh...she told me over a little chicken, which I liked, in my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they made me some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And that was the first meal I ate; and which I heard this story many times later on from my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Well, my..my...uh...childhood was a happy one. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">From the political point of view, in 1918 <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was founded. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh...and up to 1920, there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> which was attended mostly by the children of Jewish parents, and by some non-Jewish children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The idea was that the Habsburg monarchy, the system, tried to Germanize wherever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And for that purpose they used minorities; one of them were the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">In return, they were getting certain concessions, to which they had to be entitled as full citizens anyways; but it was an abuse which went on through centuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And I remember in 1920, when the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And my father was raised in the German language only; although he spoke Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He was ready to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but he changed his mind; and I...all my schooling was Czech, with the exception of...uh...being tutored privately with a few other Jewish children by the former principal of the <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , Mr. Joseph [Meyer (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then I got a job in a ready-to-wear manufacturing place; where I worked until 1936, when I had to join the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Our lives there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boskovice</span> were beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We had a lot of...uh...opportunities and exploit...exploited them a lot...while, while uh.... Sporting opportunities--like skiing, skating, hiking, swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is located in...In a very scenic section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was called "the Moravian Swiss."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION: Was there a strong religious feeling in your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER: Well, there were a few very religious people. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We, personally, were irreligious. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">As a matter of fact, my father was an atheist, and so am I. My grandfather was religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">His wife, my grandmother--is paternal--was not; but she kept a kosher <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because of his sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And when she passed away, my mother kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span> for his sake--for Grandfather's sake-until he passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He did not live with us, but he ate with us at noontime and dinners; while the breakfast was sent to him in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh...as soon as Grandfather died, my sister and I said to my mother, "Let's stop with that kosher deal, because we...we don't believe in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we eat...eat everything anyways." </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And that was...that was the end of the kosher housekeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I think he died in '32 or '33. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh, we...we were a group of Jewish youngsters who had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh...Although we were friendly with the non-Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">As a matter of fact, I had a few very good friends among them from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But there was a certain social...uh...barrier between the two religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And as children, I remember, we had even wars between the Jews and the Christians, where we were throwing at...at each other stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And a half an hour later, we played soccer together. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was just all on friendly, very friendly terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I think that the population there, with the exceptions of course, accepted us as full-fledged citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was at that time democratic under the...the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Uh...The president was Tomas Masaryk, a humanitarian, uh...liberal politician. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And we had...we had a real...very nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Until, of course, the occupation of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I joined the army 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The...in October, I believe, of 1938, I was still in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The Sudetenland, which were the <span class="REGION">border regions</span> occupied primarily by German-speaking people, were ceded to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And in...and I was discharged on February the 28th, in 1939.</span></p>

ANSWER: Well, it was a great anxiety among the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They didn't know what to do, what not to do and...uh.... For...for instance, I had buried in the little <span class="DLF">yard</span> under a big stone a tin box with some of our jewelry, and also with some of the jewelry which my uncle sent us from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Yet during the war, before we left, we had to take in into a <span class="INT_SPACE">spare room</span> another fellow which was not Jewish; and he lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And on that day when we were moving out in the morning to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , each with suitcase or whatever we could drag, he was already stealing from what we left there into his own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Now speaking of this, when I came back in 1945 I took the...the man who worked for my original boss, and who was the...the...uh...man who handled packages, um. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">What do you called it? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">A menial laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I says to him, "Joseph, take a pick and a shovel, and let's go with me into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we used to live." </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And we got into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> ; and I says, "Dig here." </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I show him where to dig. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , in that L-shaped <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there was that fellow who still lived there after we left...in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we found nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And he hollers from up there, he says, "I didn't take anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It must be there." </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I says, "If you didn't take it, then it must be here." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I says, "Try farther." </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he found that stone, lifted the stone and there was that box, a little bit larger than this and about that tall...that high. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The linoleum cover which I put on--it wasn't linoleum, it was an oil cloth-- entirely disintegrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The box disintegrated in that wet, probably acidy soil; but everything else was there in the shape of that box. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And I picked the stuff up and this (laughing) guy was looking, and he was probably sorry that he didn't know the thing is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So that was one of the things, how...how we had to handle ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Uh... I also remember one evening, I was looking out from where our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was, from the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> down on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ; which is actually the first floor in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So it wasn't too high from the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> where people walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I noticed two fellows as they were...walked by, and they saw us and they said, "What the Hell. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They can't walk out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But they had enough https://collections.ushmm.org 13of a good time." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That was the feeling at least of that...of one part of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We also hid my sister's dowry long before that happened, because we were very insecure what might happen or might not happen with people which we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Gentile people. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And most of it I got back after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Uh, other restrictions...just terror and...uh, the...the insecurity. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Nobody knew what the next day will bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">As a matter of fact, I remember one very interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There were some SS men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ; and they were led around by a German fellow who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and who used to be the policeman for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> when it existed yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That was a separate political entity up ‘til 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">His name was [Estelberger (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he took these SS men around, and they at that time arrested two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">One fellow who lives now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , a survivor--his name is Kurt [Steckemacher (ph)], now Kurt Steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the other one did not survive; his name was [Lam (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And as they passed by my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I walk out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And [Estelberger (ph)| knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And they ignored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They could have just taken me along like anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That was the only encounter I had at that time with meeting, physically, an SS man--who passed by while I was locking the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Right now, I don't remember of any...uh...specifics. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">This Mr. [Hanauk (ph)| was also arrested for a couple of weeks, but what...was let out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That is the man who later on worked on the waterworks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I...then I remember an industrialist of the same name as mine, Ticho. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">His name was Paul Ticho; was arrested, brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spielberg</span> ,* which used to be a <span class="BUILDING">medieval jail</span> --<span class="INT_SPACE">torture chambers</span> ; and I believe he died, either there or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">His son, an opthamologist, lives today in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I'm in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Dr. Karl Ticho. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">° A <span class="BUILDING">fortress-prison</span> located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">https://collections.ushmm.org 14

<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">That's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I remember now what I wanted to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">There was a rumor that the Germans are looking for somebody who would take care of the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And at that time already, one of the first transports from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , were arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Always on Thursday morning, or latest Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Once a week, there came a transport of 60 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> of regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with 40 people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">That is 2,400 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And that started somehow in early March, I believe, or mid-March [1943].</span></p>

"</span><span class="sentence" id="837">Fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="838">According to...knowing the...I would say, the mentality of the Germans, I immediately set up a little [card-a-take (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I don't know what you call it in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">A little file system. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And I wrote down, "Barney so and so got sick on the 12th." </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And when Barney wasn't right on the 15th, I tore that card up;
