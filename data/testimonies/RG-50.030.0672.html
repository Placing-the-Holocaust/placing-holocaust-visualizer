lawyer came, and they spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And I didn't know what they were speaking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And after that, I just took him back to his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Oh, I, interaction with the prisoner? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I had one, Herman, Herman Goering, I, I was on his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> when he had to go take his <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You know, they got one <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or two <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> a week or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I was on his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>

</span><span class="sentence" id="298">And, and I had to go into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he was going to take his <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And only, I only had a blackjack on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">No weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And he complained about something to me, and I didn't what he was complaining about. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So, I called the sergeant of the guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And here, he was complaining about the <span class="DLF">door</span> being open because the draft was getting him. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And here, the sergeant of the guard, you know, told him the <span class="DLF">door</span> had to be open because we had another soldier there walking up and down the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> with a weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So, and that <span class="DLF">door</span> had to be open. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So, finally, he asked for another towel, and he got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And he, instead of taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , he took a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And that's the only reaction I had with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But I was on his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> a lot, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And he just set there. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And they just read. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They're looking through papers, and that was about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Some of them, before when they get up in the morning, Julius Streicher, I think, he was across from the, Goering. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I had him one time, and he would get up, they were supposed to get up, I think, 7:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And he would get up maybe a little earlier, 7, and he did exercises in his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And what I couldn't believe what he did, they didn't have any running water in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So, he flushed his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> a few times, and he took the water and like put it over his shoulders and that to cool off. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And then he would get, ask for his clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We had their clothes in another <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we would bring their clothes in for him to get dressed, and he was ready for, for <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That's all I can, and I know I was in a lot of other <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I walked the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">That was, I didn't like walking that <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was night, you know, and on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , we had a, a weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It was an automatic weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And, and we had, and then, we used to guard the <span class="DLF">doorways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You're coming into the <span class="DLF">cellblock</span> , or you're going out, we had to check them with their IDs. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And we had to see them around. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We had to know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And we also, then later on, we would out to, passwords like, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he would say Yogi Berra. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And that was the one for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And every day it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">When we went through a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And that's and what else I had to do there. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Oh, there was a witness wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And there was only one guard there. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">One guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And the witnesses were allowed to walk in and out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , you know, and mingle. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But at 10 o'clock, they had to be in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , you know, time to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And I'll never forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">My job was, I was there on a New

and here she said she was going to leave early because she's going to a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And, you know, once they get in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , they'll be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And here, throughout our, throughout the, you know, our ranks and throughout the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , there was a story about one of these women, they wore, she wore riding clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And what she would do, and I don't know if I should tell you this. </span><span class="sentence"

she was or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And then, I had one girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I guess it was her. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">She kept coming into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and wanted to see the lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I told her the lieutenant is going to be gone. </span><span class="sentence"

</span><span class="sentence" id="368">And that's all I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I was just amazed at the, you know, how small it was because all those people were in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And you know, I looked at there, and I seen this one machine there. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It was a stenotype machine. </span><span
