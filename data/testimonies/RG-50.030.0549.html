<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Right, to Mr. Dolf Henkes, who became quite a well known artist in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that’s an important connection, cause until like the 80s, I couldn’t figure out why I was given to one person and not to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He was a friend of Daddy’s, and I did find out later that they were both artists. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Daddy’s an art — was an artist.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  So, I was given to Mr. Henkes, he was a single man, always was, and had — took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — well, first he took me to <span class="REGION">farm country</span> , where a lot of kids were hidden, November 10, 2008 but he found — the conditions he’d found were atrocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">It was behind a chicken coup, there was a family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I think it was a mutual decision, they didn’t want me, cause I cried a lot, you know, I would have given them away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  You’re a baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  We can talk about that later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Enough witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So he took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Mom and Pop are — Mom came to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I think the reason my birthday was celebrated in August, nobody knew a thing about me, was that they got me in August, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I know when November 10, 2008 Mother and Daddy went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , that was like the 27" or something, July. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Figure they futzed around a little bit, finally found somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So in August, it was, you know, a new beginning for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And they couldn’t have children, so you know, I was an answer to their prayers as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  And they had always lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheidam</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> right next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he — he was active, Pop was active in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , and Mom used to volunteer the Red Cross, so it’s — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I’m sure they had —
QUESTION:  How old were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Were they older than your own parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  No, they were — Mom was born in the same year, 1913, just like Mother and Daddy were, and Pop was maybe about five years older.</span></p>

ANSWER:  So — but I didn’t look like anybody, you know, when — it’s amazing how many people — it really did take a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to bring up this child, because they weren’t the only — you know, they took the biggest risk, but there was the pediatrician they found to examine me, who guessed at my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Yeah, August sounds good, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Two years old, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You know, it’s two or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There was the <span class="BUILDING">food stamp office</span> that gave me a s— a stamp so I could eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So you’d have food rations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yeah, I had food rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Let’s see, what else? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Oh, there were people that Mom knew — oh, one friend of theirs was a policeman, and from an old coat of his, I got this wonderful navy cape that she sewed. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I must have look — you know, and it had a lining, I remember a plaid lining. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So I must have, you know, worn. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And the — the first picture I had was with a little knitted dress that was pulled — you know, it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Nobody else had anything either. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So, they pull that thing on and started over, and made this pretty dress for this little girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  And you — you had no brothers and sisters in that family, or did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  None. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">No, I had — you know, I was first child of my natural family and they never had children either. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So, as Mom used to call me when she aged, and could remember my name, she’d say, oh, here comes my only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, you know, we all — always meant a lot to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">November 10, 2008
QUESTION:  Then let’s go back to your — your — you’ve been — you end up with them, and your earliest memories then, with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Do you ha — can you pull those —
ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">As a matter of fact, I wrote a story about this, because it keeps flashing in front of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And that is the first time I saw a parade, or I thought I saw a parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We u — we lived three different <span class="NPIP">places</span> during four years, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  You were with them for four years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  No, I was with them all my life, but —
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  — you know, communication was much slower than it was —
QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  — so when people in one end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> started making — posing questions that they couldn’t or wouldn’t answer, we’d just move across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Well, you know, that doesn’t make any sense now, but it did then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Of course, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  So, the second <span class="NPIP">place</span> we lived was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> you had these little spy windows at — at the front of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , so you could see who was at the <span class="DLF">front door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Well, I was not — never ne — knew why, I was never allowed near the <span class="DLF">window</span> anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Strange rule, I thought, but —
QUESTION:  You weren’t allowed, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">November 10, 2008
ANSWER:  Not allowed near the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Well, what do you do when you’re told you’re not — told you’re not allowed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  Cold and clammy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And there is a — a parade of men, and I could count, I could count to 10, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And there were five men across, and then a row back, and I don’t know how many there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And they were — there was a drum in front of them, one drummer. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And these people had strange costumes, to a child’s eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They were all kind of brown and gray and black. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But it wasn’t a happy parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Just kind of strange, but I thought it was a parade, because I had never seen a parade, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And some wore hats, and some that — I can remember the glistening of their hair, those that weren't — weren’t wearing hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They all had carried a roll of some sort, which later on I figured out were blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Where we lived, just around the <span class="DLF">block</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">November 10, 2008
ANSWER:  And so, they were having their last walk in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because you know, when they went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and the <span class="DLF">door</span> closed —
QUESTION:  So these were not soldiers, these were just ordinary people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  These were — these were men that were found, they’re being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And of course, you know, I was being protected from whatever nasty was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I didn’t know it was nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I couldn’t figure it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Why would you have a parade on a rainy day, why didn't they cancel it? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I knew that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And there wasn’t any happy music.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  And there was a drummer. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That’s so strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was just a — a single drummer. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And then of course, it was much later when I figured out that their fate was probably sealed when —
QUESTION:  They were found.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  — they sealed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  And — but, you know, Mom and Pop always, always worked hard at protecting me from — from my other life. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I— my life kind of became a conspiracy of silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There is good and there is bad in that, I’m afraid.</span></p>
