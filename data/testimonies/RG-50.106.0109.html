<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  Well, what do they think? </span><span class="sentence" id="889">They probably resented it up to a certain extent, because whenever the Germans needed something, they went to the Judenrat, and it was a vicious circle, and the Judenrat had to accommodate them, to keep peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They thought they would; of course, they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And also, everybody was resentful August 15, 1998 to a certain extent because they thought that the Judenrat is safe, and it wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">It was just delaying it a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="975">ANSWER:  You know, this is the most amazing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">When we were 22 months in hiding, when we went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we bribed — Julian bribed a Jewish policeman, who probably bribed the other one, and they let us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">They closed their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Julian went with him, with her husband, who led the way, and I was behind, walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And as we had to pass the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> on the way there. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">There was no other way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And there was a soldier standing, watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">At a certain moment, when Julian was with him, he said, halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Stopped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So Julian said — first he thought he 1s going to ask for his papers, so he says, I have [speaks foreign language here] which means, I have a — I am allowed to walk after curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">He had that document. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">August 15, 1998 He says [speaks foreign language], it’s not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Julian had a — what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Not lantern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  Flashlight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  Flashlight in his pocket and it just happened that the flashlight was on and the light was seeking through. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So he — that’s why he stopped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And he thought he — he is going to ask him for papers, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">That was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Then we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November to August °44. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , you entered, there was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , and a <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> without the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pantry</span> was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And then you entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> behind the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">There was no separate <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , it had to be through the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">They lived all their lives, especially in the winter, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , because there was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">She entertained German soldiers in that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">We were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">We could not — can you imagine in 22 months you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say a lot of word, and you cannot make a — a loud step, and you cannot be sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">We lived like that in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for 22 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">In other words, if we wanted to use the facilities, you had to go a half a <span class="DLF">flight stairs</span> down, and there was, probably for — for many people, there was the facility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">People have, when I talk to my granddaughter’s class about it, one boy got up and said, how did August 15, 1998 you do without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I said, that’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">There was a fire in th — in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , constantly, and that fire helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Whatever you had to burn, you burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And the rest you pour out down the <span class="DLF">drain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So he was satisfied when I explained to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">I said, believe me, it wasn’t easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Julian developed such a magnificent sense of hearing that he knew what was going on in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> before I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">From certain — he knew which — which <span class="NPIP">place</span> the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was squeaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">One time an electrical man came to check the electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We didn't know he 1s coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And of course he had to come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So that was a — there was a mirror with a—a piece of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so one could hide behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Well Julian s — only heard the words, electricity, and he pointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had to look always unoccupied, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And he looked at the ri — lamps or something, checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And when he left, she came in and she says, good work guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot of things, of clothing in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she would sell 1t for us, and we would give her the money for the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told her, we don’t have any money any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">So she was — she was very good about tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">When he didn’t see, she would open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and quickly push in a — a— a— some soup, let’s say, or some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We ate very little, but whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">There was a August 15, 1998 <span class="DLF">window</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was overlooking a <span class="DLF">field</span> , and a young girl would come every day with her cow to let the cow roam around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And I wouldn’t stand at the <span class="DLF">window</span> because I was afraid somebody might spot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So I would kneel at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and look at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn’t give to be this cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I mean, people don’t know what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">22 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">She worked for a <span class="NPIP">German place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">She spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">She didn’t know how to read it, but she spoke German, for some reason she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And once in awhile she would invite those German soldiers over for a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So I help her cook and bake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And then we would hide in that <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And she would give them enough to — drinks to make them half drunk, and they would lie down on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And when they were asleep, we would come in, go right near. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting between the German and the Russian armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Terrible fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">The entire <span class="BUILDING">household</span> went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , except us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So we were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> , and Julian kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn’t hear that shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">When suddenly the shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">At the moment when I said that, she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she said, you are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">The Russians are here, you can go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">There was no joy in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">So I said — my reaction was, now I am going to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And I went to sleep August 15, 1998 without fear, once. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Julian went out right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I couldn’t make myself go out for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I was afraid to face the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Beautiful, sunny afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where I was born, where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I didn’t know a living soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">He says, I don’t know, let’s just walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And as we were walking a man approached us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And he saw me, and he stood there and said, I don’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Aren’t you Isadore Salzburg’s daughter? </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Said to us, where are you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I said, I don’t know, we don’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He says, come with me, I just opened an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , it belonged to a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">So we went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , but it didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I slept on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , Julian slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And this was our first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that came out from hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was full of people in a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">You were — you wouldn’t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s — each other stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Of course, I didn’t have a penny to mours — to our soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">So I — one day I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of hiding a mile away, there was something about the — the way they were walking, like we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And I —I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a lawyer, her husband died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">We August 15, 1998 had a — a-an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> full of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And she — the first thing she said to me, she took out some money, pocket money — paper money from her pocket and said, do you need any money” It was so unimportant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Here, have some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And that was the first money we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a — as a physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">QUESTION:  Be-Before we go on to that, I wanted to ask you a few more questions.</span></p>
