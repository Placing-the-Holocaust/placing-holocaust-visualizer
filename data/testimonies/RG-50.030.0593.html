ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay, and then just tell me about your childhood; your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and your family, and what — what life was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My father was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father was Jewish, my mother was Catholic, but neither of them really practiced their religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My father was a very successful physician, so we had a very nice, privileged life. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , which was a very modern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">They had <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gropius</span> , and I had a very privileged childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We had live-in helpers who were like family and so my childhood was a very happy childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Do you have any siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Yes, I have a sister who’s five years older than I, here name is — was Lisalotte(ph), and now is Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my brother, who’s three years older than I, October 15, 2010 his name is Karl Theodore, and is now Ted. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My sister lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , my brother lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ann Arbor</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Okay, did you — you attended <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Yes, I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and — for four years, and my teacher, whom I adored, was Fraulein Gruninger(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Wagenborg(ph) schule</span> and had a very happy early education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Were there both Jewish and non-Jewish children at this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Yes, there were all kinds of children, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I have a friendship book in which some of them signed and had their pictures, and they’re of all religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Okay, so a lot of your friends were both Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Yes, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">What are some of your earliest childhood memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, I have a lot of them, and many of them are in a memoir which I wrote, and was published last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We were very close to my parents and we did the usual amusements and entertainments for Germans of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We went walking a lot, and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">puppet theater</span> , and we visited my grandparents, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ulm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And in the summer, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , where my maternal grandparents had an <span class="REGION">estate</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And so for the first seven October 15, 2010 or eight years of my life, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> every summer to spend time at the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So —
QUESTION:  That’s so cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  — Thad a very privileged childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Nothing but happy childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  That’s so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So you said that your family didn’t really practice religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Did you do any — prac — do any — I guess, recognize any Jewish holidays or Christian holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who were Jewish, I don’t think they practiced their religion either, which was not unusual for a lot of German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But I did go to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I went to German Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week and it was just part of my growing up, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1940, I became a member of the <span class="BUILDING">congregational church</span> , which apparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Remind me again what year you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  I was born in 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It seems that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> was rather late in having anti-Semitism visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I did know that — I think in 1938 perhaps, I was no longer allowed to go to October 15, 2010 the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But I stayed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I think until early in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">However, in 1938, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out after a fo — short period. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And he was there for a month, and the requirements for leaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and that you had served in the German army in World War I. And my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then, we’re not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but I was told that the police chief in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> had a six year old son, and my father was the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child’s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And that when this police chief heard that my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and had already applied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So my father got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> after a month, after he had to have surgery which was caused by his stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , where they ruined his sinuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He left through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and then went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And he came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in September of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My brother, my sister and I were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in, I think April of 1939, on the Kindertransport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Well, let’s — let’s back up a little fur — a little bit before we talk about the Kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Do you remember — you said you remember not being able to October 15, 2010 go to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Do you remember anything else happening at — you know, your father losing his practice, but I mean, did children treat you differently at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">No one treated me differently while I was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My teacher didn’t, my friends didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So it really didn’t affect me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I was probably doing something very silly, I— my mother did let me have English lessons for a short while. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I remember going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and practicing my little English sayings, which of course was not very smart, because if anyone had heard me, there might have been a problem, but fortunately no one ever heard me or paid attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  So you attended <span class="BUILDING">school</span> up until you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I think I probably was taken out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> few weeks or months, I really don’t remember how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But I know that my mother had lots of clothes made for me to take to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I did have these English lessons, but I don’t remember how long I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Did your family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , did your parents talk about the Nazi rise to power?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  It wasn’t a concern? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  No, the only thing I remember is that the night my father was arrested, my mother woke me up and I remember having to say goodbye to my father, but that’s
QUESTION:  How long — sorry to interrupt —
ANSWER:  That’s all —
QUESTION:  — how long was he in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  About a month, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Okay, so when did your parents talk to you about the Kindertransport? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">When did you know that decision had been made’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I don’t really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I don’t remember whether my mother ever explained it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was through my mother that we were able to get out, because she did all this while my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  So this was in April or May of 39?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I think we left in April 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And then what — what went into the preparation? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Like you said your mother had clothes —
ANSWER:  My mother had lots of clothes made, and I had a ba — brand new quilt for my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and she packed all my things, and I had some of my favorite books. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">One was about three Teddy bears, another one was about Kaspalay(ph), which is a puppet. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">October 15, 2010 And [| also had family photo albums that she gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And — but I really don’t remember being scared or traumatized. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I-I just didn’t really know what was going on, I was nine years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  What about — and your brother and your sister were — went as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes, we all three left together. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Now, I’m sure that my sister, who was 14, and my brother, who was 12, have more memories of it than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My brother, for example, remembers my mother saying goodbye to us at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I’ve read recently that Nazis did not want parents on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> — on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , but apparently my mother did go, and my brother remembers that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I don’t remember that at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  So you don’t — you don’t recall the days leading up — whether or not — how you were feeling —
ANSWER:  No, not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Do you recall the — the journey to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  A little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I played the violin at that time, and I know they made me play the violin on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , because many Jewish families bought expensive musical instruments to give to their children to take out, so that they could be sold for money later. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so the Nazis wanted to make sure that I could play the violin, October 15, 2010 and I did, and I remember I played “Ach du lieber Augustine,” which was a famous song at the time for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But that’s all I really remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Okay, did you know if you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  I think so, and then by whatever to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where the three English families that were taking us, met us. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And my sister went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buxton</span> , my brother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harrow</span> , and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marple</span> , which is outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So what was the family like who you lived with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  My foster father was professor of engineering at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Manchester</span> , and his wife Edith. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they had twin daughters who were about six months older than I, Joyce and Kathleen. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And the day that I arrived, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marple</span> , my English family had a high tea in my honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I was very surprised, because I thought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster mother disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German teacher from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> to come for the day and make my transition less traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But from then on, I was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I am still in touch with them, and in 2008 I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for the twins 80" birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we correspond, we send each other letters with pictures of our October 15, 2010 grandchildren, and we’re still very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The only one in the family who is that way with the English family is I. My brother and sister did not keep in touch with theirs until a few years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Wa — were there a lot of English customs that you had to adjust to, that was different from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Well, the one that I remember — and at — at this time, you could still write to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My English foster mother always gave me tea, like everyone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that that might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it was all right for me to have tea without milk in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And my mother said, oh yes, she has tea at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Well, what my mother didn’t realize is that English tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> tea is fairly weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so my mother said no, it’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So I learned to drink English tea, but was not very fond of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I wasn’t too fond of mutton either, although I did like Shepherd’s pie, which is ground mutton with mashed potatoes and gravy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  I like that as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  And high tea, I liked high tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I had never had Jell-O, and very often my English foster mother made a dessert with different colors of Jell-O that was all chopped up and very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And she also made lemon curd, which I’d never had October 15, 2010 before. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And she always told me when I met them later in 1980, that I would come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I would try to help, and I would say, I will make — meaning that I would help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I remember squeezing lots of lemons for lemon curd.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  So did — you said that you had taken some English lessons, but did it take you a while to learn the la — the — your new language?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I guess so, although I really don’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Did you attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yes, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> a week after I got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Manchester High School</span> for girls, which was an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , so we commuted from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marple</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , and the twins went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I think they were probably a year ahead of me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I remember loving my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And then when the war started in September, after a while, when bombing started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , like many other British children, we were evacuated to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So I had another English family, a Mrs. Emerson and her daughter, who was in her 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">She was the — the — Mrs. Emerson was a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Cheadle Hulme school</span> , which was an affiliate of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Did the two twins go with you when you went — October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  No, the twins went to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , but I went as a day student.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Where were your brother and sister at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  My brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harrow</span> with his English family, and my sister was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buxton</span> with hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My brother’s family had a daughter who was a little bit older than my brother, and my sister’s family I think had four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I saw them once while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we all got together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harrow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Did you return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marple</span> after being evacuated to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , or did you —
ANSWER:  I went there I think on weekends, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I just didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Did you experience any air raids, did you —
ANSWER:  No, I didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  So what — do you recall ha — what your knowledge was of the war during this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Did you read about it, or hear about what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I knew that there was a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The one thing I do remember 1s that Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose, spoke on the radio every week to the children of <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> to keep our courage up. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And that’s about all I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  How long were you there? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  I was there for about a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So, do — and you — you wrote to your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">How long did you — were you able to keep in contact with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  I really don’t remember, but I know in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Now, my mother stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because she didn’t have a German visa, she was born in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , so she had a Czech visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And there — it wasn’t quite as rapid. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And she eventually, she tried to pack up our — all our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and our paintings, our — all our belongings to send to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and of course nothing was ever delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My parents lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But she left to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where my maternal grandparents had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which she inherited. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> on the pretense of going to sell that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she never left <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And she then went through <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> in September of 1940 and came directly to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So I hadn’t seen her for a year and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Where was your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I know he said — you — he got a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Did he — where did he leave to?</span></p>
