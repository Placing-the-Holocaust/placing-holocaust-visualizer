<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born on August the 7th, 1912 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , the capital of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was, until 1918, part of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">In 1918, it was uh given to to ...by the powers to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> ; and in 1940 it was occu...on uh June the 28th, 1940, 1t was occupied by the Soviets as compensation for twenty years of Romanian occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It hadn't been for over two hundred years part of any <span class="REGION">Russian empire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It...1 would say it was occupied as a result of the Stalin-Hitler pact, and uh the same criteria should apply to it as they applied today to the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh in these forty years, the Russians have been able to change demographically the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Interesting is the fact that they have attracted a large group of Russian Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> ...
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We'll come to some of these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I would like to ask you to describe your childhood before World War II, when you were growing up.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Tell me what happened to you at that time, once the Nazis came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  In uh in uh...I found myself...the Nazis attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> on uh June the 22nd, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh I

in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I had two, two and a half jobs as they called staukas (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Uh still not enough to make a good...a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Conditions were tight, very lousy in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and uh and uh one really had a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My wife also worked in that time as the head of a cooperative and uh with her and my salaries we could barely uh make ends meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">At the...as soon as Hitler attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> uh on June the 22nd, 1941, three months later I found myself in the uh western part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukrainia</span> uh uh east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenets Podolski</span> and I tried to make my way back to to uh...and we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenets Podolski</span> in the <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There we met...uh we were a group of three physicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Uh Gabriel Zinreich, my friend and his wife and his father-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Uh Frank uh uh...I think his first name was Solomom Frank and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brasov</span> both his...were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> whose uh native tongue was Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenets Podolski</span> we found Hungarian uh troops and again one of these uh uh seldom happened really a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Uh I uh...1n 1936...and I'm coming back, uh going back...in 1936 after I graduated I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> and went from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> to take the license in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My parents lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My mother was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I wasn't married in that time and uh I passed the uh the exam which was not quite easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It is the...they called it the notification (ph) and I got an off...an offer to have a locum tenence (ph) near the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and uh uh I earned quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I wasn't uh I wasn't married and I ate in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a Hungarian priest whose wife came from uh uh the northern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And while being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenets Podolski</span> ...now I'm coming back...now again '41...we met somebody who was from...a sergeant picked us up from the Hungarian army and he happened to be from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonta</span> , <span class="REGION">Szatmar area</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He uh he apparently knew about what's going to happen to the Jews in in uh in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukrainia</span> because uh when I established that I knew somebody from from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonta</span> where he was from...it turned out that the mother-in-law of the priest in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I ate in in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> by the name of uh of uh Beius, Ujlak...uh he said this is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">You have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in that time, 1941, were still alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We had...Gabriel Zinreich, my friend, had a Hungarian-speaking wife and he put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But in order to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> we had to pass through <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , through the General Government, and it happens that when we passed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> uh over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dniester</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horodienka</span> we got picked up by Hungarian gendarmerie, uh beaten and uh we ended up later in the ghetto, in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And here started our Polish episode which had to...which turned out to last the whole war and ended up in 1944 where I joined the Polish army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Tell me about the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where we ended...where we lived was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It, it was fascinating to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I had never seen a uh a uh an establishment like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolovka</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It had no <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It had no sanitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It had no water supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It had no electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It uh...you had a wasser treiger (ph) who had to bring the water to the people who paid him. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You uh...you uh...there were approximately sixteen to eighteen hundred Jews in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was a natural <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was like a stetl from the time of, which Shalom Alehem described. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I have never been in such a <span class="BUILDING">stetl</span> and uh for me it was really fascinating to to to to study it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It uh...one doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">One Jewish doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">One Jewish dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The doctor was Dr. Teibers (ph) and everyone had a sufix in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Dr. Teibers was called Tiberhazel. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The dentist was called...his name was Gunie Wiesenthal...was called Gunie Pipick (ph) because he was uh heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Uh the Jews lived around a remick (ph), the ring platz (ph) in the center of which was a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Magister Schwartz was the the pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">These were attached <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> but the the Germans didn't really need to establish a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There was a natural <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They just established that no gentile had...be permitted to come into that <span class="REGION">area</span> and no Jew is permitted to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was difficult to reinforce this because the <span class="DLF">borders</span> of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were quite uh loose, so it happened that these Jews were able to communicate with the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Having done commerce and business with them for so many years, they knew each other and uh life was naturally easier than in the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Uh we had problems with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I saw immediately that uh uh I have to to do something to uh to establish a source of food and uh I went to that Dr. Teibers if he could direct to me his uh overflow. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He said there is really no overflow at this time, and you know, uh in that time you didn't pay for a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You, you...the farmers or the people who came for medical consultation paid in uh in food. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So...but he said...and he gave this advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">If you get the permission to practice outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , because there are no doctors around here, uh we...you you could uh you could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I would like to mention here the attitude of the Jews in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">When I came in, the Russian had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The Russian had been there, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolovka</span> , since the seventeenth of uh September of uh 1939 when they entered the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and there was...the attitude of the Jews was not uh friendly towards the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Many Jews had been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So were many Ukrainian who had been deported, especially Ukrainians who belonged to the National uh Nationalistic organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Ukrainians were very uh very nationalistic in their political aspiration and as soon as Hitler attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , the <span class="REGION">area</span> was flooded with uh leaflets in which uh they uh were proclaiming that the time had come to establish the uh Volna Ukraina (ph), that means the free <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The leaflets were signed by a Ukrainian uh uh uh leader by the name of Stephan Bandera who established a group of people later who uh carried his name and they were called Banderovitsis (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Very anti- Semitic and very anti-Soviet. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They said the time has come to proclaim the free Ukraina, to kill the Jews and the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The uh...[ didn't know how to go about getting the permission and I was directed to what the chief of the Judenrat , the Judenaltester who was a man by the name of Max Glickstern, Glickstern. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Max Glickstern was married to a uh woman from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> by the name of Hilda, Hilda uh Zinreich and was a cousin of the, my friend Gabriel Zinreich, so I had access to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He was a businessman who never did very well, but when he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he was already nominated to be the elder of the Judenrat . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Uh he uh lived like a king really. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He had power. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Also, being a small community but the powers uh con...uh con...confer power to a human being and his attitude changes completely and uh it did on uh Max too. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">While I would have to say that in many instances he behaved very honestly, still people who had money to bribe and the Judenrat was bribable to a very, very large degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So was everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Uh there's...uh belonging to their admini....to the so-called Jewish administration uh he gave me a uh a...he got for me letter signed by a priest in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> uh outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolovka</span> by the name of Bicewslote (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He directed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He sent letters to the uh lecaspoiutove (ph) which was the Kreisars (ph) of the of the Ukrainian physician who was in charge of the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and he gave me permission to the...uh to practice there. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The letter from the priest was signed by a priest by the name of Stamosese (ph) who was the leader of the Ukrainian organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we were brought by a uh uh man whose family later survived the war by the name of Sturmer who was a person who had intimate contact with the farmers around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolovka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He still managed to keep a couple of horses hidden in someplace outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benceslote</span> (ph) and now started for me a a very interesting uh uh practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It lasted no more than six months because the <span class="REGION">area</span> was later declared in May uh '42 Judenrein . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">When we came there uh he brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the man by the name of Samy Reinstein who had a who had a <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> where he had what they call it propinatzia. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He sold liquor, schnaps and uh small uh items to the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Right now he didn't have any more that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and he was able to rent us a few uh a couple of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Uh the next day he he told me I should go to introduce myself to the priest being the leader of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Father Shamosheshin (ph) spoke some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He was a lean mean in his early fifties or late forties. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He uh uh was very non- committal. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He said for twenty-five years I had asked the Polish government uh to send a physician here. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Uh the Germans had to come finally to make it possible for Benceslote to have a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Benceslote was also known that it had a large estate belong to an absentee land-lord by the name of Count Sapira (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The count...the estate had been uh taken over by the Soviets and transformed into a <span class="DLF">state farm</span> and the Germans left 1t the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">A week later an event occurred which uh which was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Somebody knocked at the <span class="DLF">window</span> of our of our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and uh when...Mr. Reinstein, Samy Reinstetn opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , he said Doctor, it's for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They want you to come immediately to the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The wife of the priest is sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I, having his assurances that this, the call was genuine because I was afraid to go in the middle of the night, I uh...the man who who had come for me was a militant (ph) from the militia, Ukrainian militia. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I found the uh the wife of the priest in severe upper abdominal pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">She had a gall bladder attack, gall stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">She said she had it for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">She was in agony. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She was perspired, begging to help her and so was her husband, uh the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I had one ampule (ph) of a synthetic morphine opium (ph) preparation, , which I gave her and uh she promptly vomited as soon as I gave it to her, even before I thought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But she fell asleep and uh I left her for a couple of hours and I came next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I found her 1n uh in uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> cooking, full of enthusiasm. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Doctor, you cured me. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I said what do you mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I was told the only cure for me was an operation and here I am free. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I feel fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It is possible that the injection had relieved the spasm and the stones had passed into the small intestine and uh and uh I really cured her. (</span><span class="sentence" id="199">laughter) As a result of 1t next Sunday as Samy Reinstein told me, the priest in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in his sermon to the community said you can do what you want with our local Jews...there were twelve or fifteen Jewish families still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benceslote</span> (ph) but the Romanian doctor you shouldn't touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And the term Romanian doctor remained with us for the whole time while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Uh a week later we were honored with a fat roasted duck sent by the priest with his thanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And a week later when I came to visit his wife, he was very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Took me into the uh into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> uh and said I would like to show you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He showed me a book published many years before. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was called Zolotaknina Hatmana Skoropatzkoro (ph), the Golden Book of the Hatman Skoropatzki. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Skoropatzki was one of the hatmans who had fought in the early twenties during the civil war against the new Soviet power. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The the group...the soldiers of hatman Skoropatzki were known to have performed, to have quite killed many Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Among the pictures in that book, he showed me a picture...he said that's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Was a young man in military uniform with a C C on his uh collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">C Cis S S...1t's the...but it has nothing to be the German SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He said it it it is Sichobeitselie Kovetz (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Sich (ph) was the national fighting organization of the Ukrainian uh uh Nationalist uh movement and uh Father Shamosheshin was the leader in his community. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">His word meant law there. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Whatever Father Shamosheshin said, went. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Naturally, we were now somehow under the protection of Father Shamosheshin. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">A month later an event took place which really uh was a lucky incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">One night somebody rang the bell uh...rang the bell...knocked on my <span class="DLF">door</span> ...no bell...knocked on the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">It was, as it turned out, a Polish refugee who had...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> who had tried in 1939 to to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We were not far from the <span class="DLF">Romanian border</span> , some hundred and fifty kilometers, and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> broke down near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielce</span> (ph) and he couldn't...and before he could repair the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> the Soviets had uh marched in, had closed the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and his name was Zarenski or Zarubski. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He was a young engineer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">He said please come. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">My wife is dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I came to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I found her almost bled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">She had a vaginal bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">She had an incomplete abortion and what she needed was a little scraping. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">She was almost in coma. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">She she had a pulse of over 200. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">She...,there was no uh uh her blood pressure was extremely low. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I I told him to get immediate some transportation to take her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borosow</span> (ph) it was the nearest <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but there was also a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I knew a couple of doctors...one Doctor un Rabinowitz (ph) and Dr. Rosenblatt (ph) who uh they are able to perform a uh a uh D&C. As soon as we brought her in they did the D&C.

<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  It's alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and now a very hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Uh food. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Food and during the summer of '42 we heard that this was the rumor that the of the Gestapo from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislow</span> (ph) is around in the <span class="REGION">area</span> liquidating <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That means aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We established a uh guard every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">In that time I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a certain Aaron Spotheim, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Aaron Spotheim had a of . , </span><span class="sentence" id="254">that means how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">That means he was a bad man. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He was really a...not a very friendly uh person. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Uh the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> real...uh really didn't like him very much but he he uh let us in and so we were happy there and with his help when the aktion star...in the <span class="REGION">area</span> started, we we decided to build our own <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> or our own front. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Being uh what he was, , he said nobody should know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I don't want anybody to come in to that, in to that uh <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> from our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So nobody really knew about our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I thought in that time that our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was a good <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We had...you know, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , around the were attached <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> attached to Mr. uh to Mr. Spotheim's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had a smaller uh <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We decided to took the <span class="DLF">border</span> between two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to separate and create between the <span class="INT_SPACE">attics</span> as a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Later I...when I compared our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> with the others, I felt it was probably the flimsiest <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> which existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It had only one positive thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Nobody knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I was witnessing...looking out from when the aktion took place and seeing in what ways they collected the people in to what they called the <span class="DLF">Umshagplatz</span> (ph) there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because because they had to take them, to take the Jews by large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> to _, uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borszczow</span> to to transport them by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to uh...our <span class="REGION">area</span> went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">annihilation camp</span> in...oh my goodness, this gives me...I don't remember it SO...(pause)...anyway uh the way how they did it convinced me that...until then I was not really convinced that people were uh gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There were rumors but nobody knew for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It really didn't make sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The whole plan of the annihilation of the Jews was conceived in such a diabolic way...having a Jewish Judenrat to collaborate, to fulfill the orders of the Germans because they had no way, no different way, no way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Having installed the Jewish police and here is an element which I would like to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">To a large degree the Jewish police was formed by former lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They were so brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Their language was so crude. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">The way...how they uh how they behaved toward the population was so revolting that many times we asked ourselves, how come these educated people...and they...you had to consider them educated people to a large degree in comparison to the other people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who who were not educated, who didn't have any university schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It uh behaved in such a way...the circumstances created 1t. Example. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">During the summer of '42, seeing that I really had nobody to rely on...I'm a stranger...I'm a foreigner...who is going to help me? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I had...we had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I started to explore the <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korulovka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">In one of these explorations I got into another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czortkow</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It had five thousand Jews there and the leader, the Judenaltester, was a lawyer by the name of Dr. Ebner (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You know in the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, every lawyer was called Herr doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I wanted what they called a psheapuska (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Pshepuska in Polish means a passirchein (ph), a permit, because I wanted to make my way or to find a way toward the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The <span class="DLF">border</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaleszczyki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It uh...when I uh sent a militia man in ann...to say if Dr. Ebner can receive me, I don't know what the militia if he understood very well, but I ended up really in front of Dr. Ebner who said, who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">What do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Very hostile. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I said, look. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I'm a physician from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">As a matter of fact I was trying to...Czernowitz had a a deputy by the name of Meyer Ebner...I say...the same last name...I said you probably must be related. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He said, sure I'm related. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">His attitude was...he called the militia man in and told him in Polish uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czortkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">That means search him. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I didn't know what...and he said uh see if he had, if he has grini papima (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="300">That means dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I didn't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He says what do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I say I would like a , a pshapuska (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He said, look doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I have no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">You are bothering me. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You take my time away. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I have... have my people to take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Get out of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or I'll give you over to the Gestapo myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I was really amazed at that hostile reaction and I was very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I left that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because he said in ten minutes you have to disappear from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="313"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czortkow</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which looked or is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which looked like a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It had big uh tall uh uh <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">eastern cities</span> of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy and probably for protection against invasions from the east, but it was a a frightening <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I was disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I was angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I was hungry, tired, and I came and throwing me out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Dr. Ebner saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I was exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a , and I fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Until in the morning I heard uh I heard engine uh noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I looked out and I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> filled with police, German police, Ukrainian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They were liquidating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">By throwing me out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he had uh really saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">To make a long story short uh at the end of September, beginning of October, finally the aktion took place in _ It was preceded by a request from the Gestapo to Max Glickstern, the Judenrateltester, to furnish two hundred fifty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The rumors said that the two hundred fifty Jews were meant to go for schmeltz (ph) what that means ?. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That means for destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I happened to witness a discussion in the Judenrat which took place to form a list of the two hundred and fifty Jews, and it it was a...the discussion which took place...he said look, you have an old uh father up there who is really...why don't you give your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">He said my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">You have an uncle and you have this...why don't you give...and everybody was pointing fingers to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It came to a point where Max Glickstern, he had to really...and I I admired him in that time...had tears in his eyes and said look, fellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I grew up, I know everyone of... grew up in this community. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I know every one of you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I am not going to make a list of two hundred and fifty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I am going to say to the community hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Whomever it will, it will hit it will hit but I'm not going to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And he left the meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So now everybody was finishing or starting to to to uh because everybody knew itt 1s it is...the end 1s near and uh the result of that aktion was really disastrous. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">It wasn't two hundred and fifty. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It ended up around fourteen hundred were taken and it explains to a large degree what has been discussed so many times in the last years. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Was it correct or was it right or was it fair from the Judenrat or the Judeneltester...I just read the book about Rumkovski, the chief of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> , you know, to give out in order to save the community a certain number of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Here Max Glickstein had re...had refused to give out two hundred fifty and later we asked ourselves the question...1f he would have given the two hundred and fifty, you know, there would have remained uh fourteen hundred still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But it was a a a question which nobody really could uh answer satisfactorily. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh some two hundred, hundred eighty or two hundred Jews who whose <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> were not found, were uh were uh survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I witnessed one scene where a uh a tailor by the name of Singer whom I had known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> uh was on his knee before a German and said, herr Gestapo, . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He looked at him...
QUESTION:  Translate that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  ..uh Mr. Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Give me back my wife and my child, to which the man looked at him and said bring me a thousand Juden. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Bring me thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And then he brought a thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">He knew the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> of every...of a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I'll tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Many people, especially the one who had uh still money...they're paying people to to to dig their <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">In this way there were people who knew about the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> of neighbors or other people, and he brought them. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">When I, we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Gusti and I...Gusti was the name of my first wife...uh Mr. Singer was was still there and the Germans had...he had his wife and his child. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">How long he survived I don't

day I got in...I think 1t was July or August '42...1 don't remember exactly...1 get a call from the, from Dr. Teibers to come, to come to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Since I have seen uh in the end of 1941 he hadn't uh shown too much interest in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I I was a little suspicious of his call and I said uh...he starts questioning...how hungry are you doctor? </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I was impression first he make fun of me, but then I thought...I say why do you ask me

.... looked in his throat and there was no (cough) uh everybody who had seen once the so-called pseudo-membranes of of diphtheria patients, it was no problem for me to make the diagnosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Itold the _ [have to to uh give him an injection. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He said you do what you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">The only thing is there were some fifteen, sixteen people in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know, the the <span class="DLF">air</span> was heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I said I want everybody out, so only four or five people remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">There was a grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Uh I found out that this was the

id="417">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">His heartbeat was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">His lungs uh I couldn't make out because of that but I gave him the injection and uh I said we'll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He said alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">You see, you're going to sleep in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I said what do you mean sleep in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He says well, you're going to stay here until the child will recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I had...I was under the impression that this is going to be just a medical call and I will leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I realized immediately if that if that child 1s not going to recover I don't think I'll recover or I'll survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But to make a long story short, I was hungry so I said look, I didn't eat the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Oh, he said, food...no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He called his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">He said why don't you make the doctor...and he said pane doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">That means herr doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So I uh said make me a a uh uh five eggs, this slanina, this bacon and they put a bottle of vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I had three drinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I felt good and I fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">When I woke up uh some ten or twelve hours later and now it was morning, next day, ten o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I went in to see my patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">He was breathing slightly better. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">He still still had some but we were able to force a little water or cold milk in his throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I uh didn't know, I didn't have what to do so meantime somebody else came and said doctor, could you see my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So my fee in that time was two chickens for a cold, so I asked the wogt if he'd give me permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">He said sure, why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Anyway in the evening, at the end of the second day I I was a a lucky uh uh proprietor of six chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I had three. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I slept the second. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I ate and drank well and the third day they...the child was breathing now much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was...it...the the serum had...1 was very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">The serum at that time was not a very concentrated serum and uh there were a lot of reactions, the reaction what we called serum disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">It...you could have really serious uh uh side reaction, sometimes even fatal. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Anyway, that child had absolutely no no side effects. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The fourth day he was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He asked for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He had now a little bit of a...still around hundred, hundred and two, being that, you know, the European thermometers were from thirty-six degrees Celsius so...centigrade...so uh I said, I asked the wogt how do you uh...do you think I could leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He says oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Never said thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">The only uh person who came forward was the wife, his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Not the mother of the...the mother of the child didn't leave the child but the grandmother, the wife of the wogt. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">She came out, took my hand and said in Ukrainian, doctor, thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">You are a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">You saved my grandchild and the wogt said, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ...here is the man who brought you. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I said...oops, I'm sorry...he

twelve chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">The moth...the grandmother of, the wife of the wogt had told me she's going to take care of and really everything was on the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="466">That means the aktion...[ am I am coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Aktion had not taken place yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">In no time the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you know, uh knew that the Romanian doctor is with a whole...meantime the rumor that I am bringing a tremendous amount of kernels back. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">To make a long story short, we had wheat only twenty kilos, not twenty I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Twenty pounds of that kernels we were able to turn into into flour and to bake it. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">The rest got lost during the inspection of a uh agricultural, German agricultural inspectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They inspected the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and this was really to to get the food out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>

class="sentence" id="478">I I was uh not only surprised but I wasn't too eager to meet, and...but he he greeted him as he answered and we stopped somehow to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I spoke a much better German. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">German was my native tongue than the man...not Singer (ph)...something Shiller (ph), Singer...something...I don't remember exactly his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But he started to talk about it and to the man...as a matter of fact, he's from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He announced the policeman, he's he's uh he's a high school teacher and uh in his civilian...he teaches mathematics at the uh <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He mentioned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and he started to talk about it and uh uh we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh that Singer, whose name was, had...apparently he had to make an appoint...he wanted something from that man, and he knew him better uh because he had brought a bottle of vodka for him and uh uh the officer

how he he he would like to be back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and then he started to talk about his father who's uh...and he he told us...apparently he felt he can uh talk to us very openly and for a uh Social Democrat he was member in the Shutzbund. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I knew more about the Shutzbund. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> the Shutzbund in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was an organization, was a fighting organization of the Social Democrats in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> who had fought against Dolfuss when he was Chancellor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and uh they were beaten and why he told us this story I didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Maybe he felt we were candidates to any uh...but he...uh then he started to talk about the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He was already drunk and he said to us in German, to me, uh yeah, Juden . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That means uh there is open season on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Everybody can shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">There is no law to protect you. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">This would be the uh...it happened that after the incident when the , when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in was annihilated, I was back into into uh uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaleszczyky</span> also trying to...I tended toward the <span class="DLF">border</span> , always to find maybe there is a way there to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And one day I saw from far the figure of that German and uh not being able any more to get out of his way, I greeted him and he was not in a very good mood and uh said, ah...and I asked him don't you feel well? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You know, I'm a physician so I ask people how they feel and he said oh, I was asked by the...to take part in this, to surround the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czortkow</span> , to which I said uh...apparently he knew what is going to happen to the Jews because then I asked him, do you let anybody escape? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He said, escape? </span><span class="sentence" id="496">My orders there to surround. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I I don't know what uh...I didn't uh take part in anything but...then he said, . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I don't know how the German people will ever be able to to uh, not to answer for it... , to be responsible for what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It remin...1t remains with me even today after so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Anyway, coming back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after the aktion, I had decided to form for myself a boivka (ph), a fighting group, and I recruited for it a woman and her husband by the name of Padover. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Why did I...it was an energetic woman in her late thirties or beginning forties who was, who grew up in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">She knew every <span class="REGION">area</span> in the...and when she talked to me about it, I knew that she really was very familiar with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">She had, she had uh uh contacts with farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">She knew farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">She had contact with farmers who were uh her friends from before and I felt it was a good...she introduced me also to a very tall, six foot two, young, eighteen year old Jewish fellow whom I recruited also because they were survivors of what had happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I had decided to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Uh to make a long story short, when we met in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> at our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , it turned out to be a complete fiasco. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Mr. Padover had decided meantime...he showed up at our <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> with an eighteen year old kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I said where is your wife, because the reason why I had recruited him was his wife, not he. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And he said ah she's too old for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The young man who had said he's going to bring a brother brought a fourteen year old kid...thin...I don't know if he was uh maybe ninety-five pounds...thin...you know, every uh wind uh draft would would...my whole fighting group turned out to be really nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Anyway we found...we had made an appointment with the Ukrainian fellow who took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh where he fed us really and uh hid us and two weeks or ten days later, there was an alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We had to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">During running there was panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We ran in different directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We lost each other and Gusti and I ended up together out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Meantime it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We didn't have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I'm reminded now the promise which Mr. Zarevski, the husband that Pole had told me...it took me one and a haLf days to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He was in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smikow</span> (ph), I don't remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hut</span> outside... knew where he lived because he had brought me to see his wife there and uh was hard to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ...he he tried to keep a very low profile, being Polish and I...then later I understood why. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Because it turned out he was a member of the underground, the Polish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">When I knocked on his <span class="DLF">window</span> it must have been four o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Uh I heard somebody moving <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Finally he opened and then I told through the <span class="DLF">window</span> who it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I uh...he opened and let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We were exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He gave us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He let us sleep there and then he said, look, uh uh this is a bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I didn't understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">To me it looked like a very good <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But he said this is...I have to find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">A week later or six days later, he said I found somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He took us on a tour which lasted probably three hours, way into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and he, on the way there, he said the furster (ph)...furster is a a uh uh Polanization or Ukrainization of the German word . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It means a man who takes care of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , of uh uh...he's a representative of the of the <span class="REGION">county</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">He sort of uh uh surveys the cutting of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> where they ma...where they collect wood for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">He he uh sells or gives the wood out to certain people in certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He's an official person. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We met him there and he again said...we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The first thing we ate something after these three and a half hours of walk and uh he was very respectful toward Mr. Zaresvki, as if he would be his superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I didn't understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Whatever he...and that he knew about us already and he said yes, I have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you, but not here where he lived...he he was with his wife there. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">He was a rep...he spoke Polish with Mr. Zarevski. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">He had certain loyalties toward the previous administration because he was the official representative of the Polish uh community there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">He was an employee of the State, not of the <span class="REGION">county</span> , and...but he was very respectful toward Mr. Zarevski, and they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> some four kilometers far in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , an empty <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - hay with an at...so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , you know, and uh we...in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> there was something which looked like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> as if somebody had slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I understood why he brought us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">That means if somebody would find out that Jews are there, he could say he didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He said he will visit us every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">He gave us a couple of uh blankets and he gave us some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">he said he's going once a week to visit us, night time, and really uh it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">For three weeks he came every week, brought us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">One day I saw around six o'clock...it was already slightly dark...two figures coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It turned out to be Zarevski and Janek. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">was the name of the person, and uh uh uh Zarevski or Zaremski, said I want to talk to you personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">My wife...so , the first thing, my wife uh sepa...stayed aside and he talked to me, he said to me uh, you know, you come from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">How well do you speak Romanian? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I said perfect, I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He said well, do you think you would like to join a fighting organization? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Join a fighting...? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Certainly, why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Which is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="562">He said it's out near

</span><span class="sentence" id="569">It still has to be approved by the <span class="BUILDING">Center</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="570">My next question was, if I join you, will I be armed? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He said everybody in this organization has a gun. . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">He said I trust you. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Uh then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He walked some three, four hundred feet, then he turned around and came back, took out a pistol, a German luger, and said here, you have this. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It had a full mag...I checked...it had a full magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">It was a 9 milimeter. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They called it the German Parabellum . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was aauha fine gun with a long. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Anyway, he came back a week later and he said, look, uh...oh yes, meantime we were...it was December, beginning of January...we were '42-'43. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">The...apparently the furster had a radio because he heard BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He told us about the Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> which takes place and the Russians are beating the hell out of of the Germans and the Germans...in that time he said, he told me about Marshall Paulus who wants to uh to uh to...was picked up by by BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He he gets, asks the permission of Hitler to to uh to give up and Hitler says no, until the last man so our mood was...right now I was going to be a member of a fighting organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I had a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You don't know what a gun in that time meant for a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">To have a gun, to be able to protect yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">You couldn't...it it was worth its own weight in gold and here I got it without...I had you know...and the news about the Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> ...1t was good news. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Our morale was...anyway it didn't last for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Now...he told me now about his plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He said I'm going to be a courier for them (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He said the contacts of the army of takes place only through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and it is very hard because they have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> to smuggle, to...by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and from there to...and from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> they have no problem getting to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> but because the Polish government in exile is direct organization from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the contacts through through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> is bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He still is waiting but his immediate superior in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lamberg</span> (ph), 1n in...had said it's a wonderful idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">He should take me in so...and I speaking Romanian because <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> had a large group of refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who had run away, military people, civilians, and there was an active Polish organization direct in charge of the Polish refugees in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">That means he had a a good in for <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to get in touch with with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was much easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Uh <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at that time had contacts with <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and through <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> they could they could get...so he felt I was the ideal uh person to make the contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It...a week later with the furster came also. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Almost two weeks later...1t was the beginning I think of February or the end of February and he came back in panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">You have to leave immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Next day a Ukrainian police is...militia is coming there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He doesn't know why they are coming but he heard one militia man who had a a Polish mother, you know, who had still...had told him about it, and uh apparently also uh ——_—srwas on the run. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Something had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He didn't tell me what and I have to give him back the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I thought that the whole thing is...he's going to bring me to somebody else he had spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He brought me...we walked, we walked I think the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I think he couldn't have brought us farther to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which looked very good for me, for...uh to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">It was...it's a hiding place under a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Unfortunately, that <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> had...the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> were boards and the boards had spaces between them, small <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There was a cow there, and when the weather was bad the cow didn't want to go out or wasn't taken <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , so when the cow had to urinate or to defecate there, especially to urinate, it came down like a, like a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and you had to run to the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Still you ended up getting some sprinkles of that urine and that urine had a smell and it impregnated what our clothes and after two or three weeks, it...we start to smell badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">You know, we hated ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">As a matter of fact a few weeks later Gusti broke out in general furuncolosys , furunculs uh small infections of the skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She was so depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">She couldn't scratch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It was itchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">It was infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">It took me probably...slowly, slowly by treating each infection infection separately, to clean it up, it took maybe two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Meantime you had to go out night time and you couldn't get out night and every night to to uh to try to get rid, to take off the the clothes and you couldn't...and it was cold...you couldn't take off the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">You were cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But you have still to air these clothes in order they should get dry to loose, because we ended up smelling terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Uh two months...it had one good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We had a built-in supply of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I learned to milk the cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I had to be careful because whenever she milked the cow, she gave us half a cup of milk each, but it wasn't enough, so I learned to try...Gusti was holding the cow and stroking her neck which the cow really liked very much and she got accustomed to Gusti stroking and I was milking her. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">In the beginning I tried...I didn't have a receptacle, you know, so I was trying to drink directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You know, when you are hungry you do many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But this was the built-in uh milk supply of that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The couple were under apparently Pole-friendly, Polish uh friendly to the Poles because the Furster never showed up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I don't really know what had happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Neither Zarevski nor the Polish Furster. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They had brought us, but they were friendly to a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The husband was Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The wife was a mixture of Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">She spoke well Polish...Maria...no...Anka (ph) was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Anka had...Gusti told her in order to give her...that she's a fine knitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">She's a good knitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">She saw her wearing an old pull-over she has. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">You know...let me have that pull-over. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I'm going to take it apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I'm going to wash the wool and knit for you a new one. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">She made her a new pull-over in three, two or three days and she was, Anka was delighted and she started to bring her more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Apparently she made it a business because she sold it for something or she exchanged it. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">She bartered it because uh Gusti was a very fast knitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">She was able to finish a pull-over in one and a half days working eight to ten hours and there was nothing else to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You know, we could go out only in the...and so it happens that in the spring or April or May, walking around by myself to <span class="DLF">air</span> , to get a little fresh air and to get rid of that smell, that I happened and probably having strayed a little too far because I had strayed once too far and I got near a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and a dog started to bark. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">In small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> if one dog starts to bark, all the dogs in the whole community...and I started to run away because I had maybe fifty or sixty dogs start a whole...you know, naturally immediately their owners will come out to investigate what's going on, so this was bad because we could be found out and uh uh the stricter interdiction by our hosts were not to go too far, to stay...and I had impression while I walked...this must have been in April...1t was already, or May uh that uh...oh yes...meantime because of that knitting business, the attitude of our hosts had had started to improve. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was only bad when they got drunk or had a fight, and usually then they uh then they had uh...they drank and they got a little high. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They started to have a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It had to do with Polish-Ukrainian or I don't know because I didn't hear but there were times when he hit her and then she was yelling, but these were not good uh omens for us because uh 1f somebody would have found out that he was hiding Jews, he would, he could have been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Anyway, coming back, walking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I had the impression somebody is following me, and I went in circles, walking a little farther than usually, and I heard uh...really I was sure now somebody followed me because I heard...he must have stepped on on a on dry branches. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I heard them uh the noise of uh branches until finally somebody told me from behind, hands up, , and...in Russian, and went through my pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I had a knife with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They took my knife away and...he took my knife and not they. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">He took my knife away. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Told me to lie down with my face down and started to inter..who I am and so I told him look, uh Romanian...now I told immediately I'm a Romanian physician, you know, and he said uh...he used the term evrei (ph) Evrei (ph) is a Russian term for Jews, but not derogatory. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Uh it uh it means you are a Jew, but it's not a derogatory term. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It's uh it's the way how in their, in the Russian passports you are being uh uh indicate your nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">He wanted to know with who I am, where I am, how long I have been there, how uh...well, he said, uh I want to see...in next week I'm going to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I saw immediately he doesn't belong to the <span class="REGION">local Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I was afraid he might be a Banderovtzi (ph) from the Ukrainian uh organization which killed Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">He didn't have the trizub. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He uh he uh he had a a German uh uh sub-machine gun, a Schmeisser and uh didn't tell me...I asked him...he didn't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">He says I would like to talk to, to see your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I want to see if it's correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">A week later or ten days later..we had made an appointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I brought Gusti there. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">What could I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Yes, he said, no word to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I don't trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">No word. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I came the uh first thing, when I came with Gusti to meet him, also night time, he looked at her, as much as he could see her in the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He said do you follow my orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I didn't know what he meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I said not to tell your host anything...orders, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So it was a military term, you know, and I didn't know...now he told us who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">He said his name was Vasia. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">He is a part of an organ....of a parachute group which were uh parachuted near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> and they have to prepare the terrain for a large group. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He said...I said how large. </span><span class="sentence"

<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Didn't know the language too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I didn't know Ukrainian too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I didn't know Polish too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">The only thing I was a physician and I came back to the term which they had called us always...the Romanian physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Number one I was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I was helpful to the population and I remembered what the priest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belce</span> , Father had said in his sermon - with the uh local Jews you can do whatever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">They regarded us as...yes, we were Jews but we were foreign Jews and we were helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I got, as a doctor as a matter of fact, a very good reputation as an obstetrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I was not qualified to be an obstetrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I got once a call to a delivery where the woman had been in labor three days, and I was very...I wanted...I was reluctant to go there because I felt I'm not qualified. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">When I came there I checked the woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">You know, you have to do something, and I made the diagnosis that the child had what they call in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in obstetrics a rim (ph) of the cervix around the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">It was...that means it was almost fully dilated and while I was checking her she had one good contraction and out came a baby boy, yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The whole excitement with the delivery, number one it was a baby boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">It was a luck to be a crying baby, you know, and the doctor had just...they gave me the credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I was just an innocent by- stander there but I got the reputation as a as a fine, good obstetrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Undeserved I have to say, but I got that reputation and I certainly wasn't going to refuse the food which they gave me for that call, because we needed it very badly, so uh coming back why we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">No money, no language, foreigners, but I was a doctor and this had helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">It had helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I would say 99.9% the element of luck helped us in our survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Who has the...basically, you needed only a couple of people or one person to find who is friendly toward you. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I met Mr. Zarevski from the Polish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">He was going to use me for his purpose as a courier, you know, to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , but I had somebody who stood, who who who trusted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Somebody who wanted to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">True, I should do things for them, but who, where in the world do you find such a a uh lucky person. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Number two, Vasia_. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">He picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I didn't look, I didn't know him, and again, how well do you know Russian? </span><span class="sentence" id="930">How well do you know the northern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> , because from there we were to get to the <span class="DLF">border</span> with no problem, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">You could. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They, they had contact with people, but beyond they...you know, they needed somebody...here there was somebody who who could manage and I felt in that time I could manage and then I was young, was in pretty good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I was always a sportsman. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Uh I wouldn't say I was adventurous, but I was daring to a certain degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Why was I daring? </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Because I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">How many times in our, in our uh uh in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I came to a point, it's right and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">There is no sign where it says where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">There were no people there to ask where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Luck, again, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Many times when I went to uh wrong I had to go back and go, you know, because it uh that part led me into a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and we tried to stay away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">The population was hostile. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">You needed only one or two persons who were friendly, who were able to...or not able...willing. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">99.9% luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">That if they caught us, there was no question. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">We had left our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Doctor Gabriel Zinreich still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolovka</span> and they hoped, they felt that what I'm doing and Gusti is, has no chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I knew that my chances were uh small, but my point of view was I'm going to try. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">At least try. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">To give in without trying, I wasn't going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And uh as uh you know, it's the results which count and uh coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I tried, we tried to push that experience aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Very very uh uh convinced that we...in order to grow roots in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we have to put our experience and not to think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Many things have to be accomplished. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Very eagerly a family, and when we found...Gusti had seven pregnancies and she, in these seven pregnancies...she had no problem getting pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">She had problems carrying the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">She...the first baby uh was six months, then five and a half months, four and a half months...but we are talking not about the times today where you have a well- equipped pre uh uh...a baby with a premature nursery. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">In that time they didn't have <span class="BUILDING">premature nursery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">We had one baby alive in 1971, and the baby...the chief of the anesthesia department came to me and said Fred, we know your history. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Uh you lost so many...uh the baby was two and a half pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">It...a two and a half pound baby in that time...I recessitated the baby myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">As an anesthesiologist I am equipped to do it and it was a baby with a good sucking reflex and some and I wanted to keep...if I could have kept that baby even in my <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , St. John's Street and, or St. John's Avenue, and uh it uh it may have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">He convinced me to send the baby to <span class="BUILDING">Baby's hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">He said this <span class="BUILDING">Presbyterian hospital</span> , the finest <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and there in order to to feed the baby they the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">They put a tube and, but again, here we are in 1951. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">The tube was not uh...1t was a polyethylene tube and in that time they may have been short of polyethylene tubes because they they uh uh sterilized it, by changing every second or third day, by boiling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Polyethylene uh in that time when you boil it, 1t gets stiff like a board. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And in their uh in their uh procedures they perforated the stomach of the baby, and while they were feeding the baby the the belly of the baby got bigger and bigger and one day I get a call from the chief resident. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">He was a Swedish uh resident. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">He said Dr. Bernard, we'll have to operate on the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I say why do you have to operate...it was five days later, or six days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">She said we took an x-ray. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We put some uh some uh radio-opaque material, and we found the tube was not in the stomach but was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">abdominal cavity</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">That means you have a perforated stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">They operated on the baby, and was a healthy, fighting baby, and uh but small, premature, and uh the baby survived surgery for two days and died of generalized .</span></p>
