daughter of Mendel and another cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And they've been blond and blue eyed so they decide they have the chance probably to survive. </span><span class="sentence"

<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Especially in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> storytelling, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Has to change, has to change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  And what I will like that you cannot really say why and in which <span class="NPIP">point</span> this change appears. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It's _+ change. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He's very ambiguous about what he's doing, and because he's not intellectual, he doesn't have he's very simple man. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And, you know, a lot of reason why he decides in this very moment to do what he's doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But it can change the minute later, so he's like somebody who is who is walking on the rope, the wire, and he can slip in any moment of the side of the good or bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And in some point, in some point I think he feels and it's because also he wants to look at himself as he is smart or that he can be successful, he does something well. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So he feels sometimes the weight of the responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I think that responsibility has left. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">That in some way the moment when you are responsible for somebody, it's something which is which created this strong attachment. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And for him it becomes a kind of obsession. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">In some ways he is obsessed by that, like the gambler, you know, at some point he's acting in irrational way. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It doesn't make sense what he's doing, you know, it's against his interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It's against the safety of himself and his family, and also it's against his world of values because no matter for him the Jews, no matter +andnot  *paidforit, what the * you know, it means it's interesting to watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I think that it makes this character in some way very real and very symbolic in the same time like, you know, like this kind of the confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I think most of the people are going not only during the wartime, but especially in those dangerous circumstances through the process of the confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And at sometimes who decide to do something just by chance, something good, the mystery of the good, you know, how the people are doing acting altruistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It's quite easy to understand why they're acting in a terrible way, why they are cruel, why they are murderers, but why they are good, you know, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It is a mystery so, you know, explore this mystery with a character, which is not angelic at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And also the _+ the people are all stereotypes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He's watching of the Jews in a very stereotype of way, and he expresses it through his language, but the Jews watch him in the same way, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They don't watch him as a human being, you know, so they are both in some way mirroring this kind of the judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And it's very difficult and complicated and it's so much when it breaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And when it breaks down, suddenly they are naked, you know, they are standing naked Jews standing like, you know, next to the naked _ and they are like looking into the mirror, you know, I thought that, you know that it's actually very touching without being, you know, emotionally judgmental or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Another word pops into my head and that's victim and how do you define a victim? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">How do you how do victims define themselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And when they have competitions as to who is the greater victim, and who owes whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And they are often tied in with stereotypes. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It also gets expressed in times of extreme what's the word I'm searching for? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">When life is so extreme, where you may lose life, when you really are a victim, you know, the associate, the one who says I'm not going to take part in this anymore is ends up being an innocent victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  You know I don't know what question I wanted to ask with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But then it comes up from what you were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Is there anything that you would like our audience, our researchers to know and to understand about what motivates your work? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">What motivates you to look at these particular stories for this kernel, that you say this I can talk about, and this is a story I can tell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  I don't want to be _ + like patterns and I don't want to be pretentious, and I don't want to speak about building <span class="DLF">bridges</span> or something like that because then I don't believe really that the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> or any movie can change the world, but I really believe that even if it Opens eyes to some, I don't know, to some reality that is not obvious it's already good. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I try to make my movie as communicative as possible and as complex as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Telling complex stories in a simple way in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And probably I have this I have this I have this urge to do it this way because I have some kind of pathological pathological, you know, ambitions without being preachy. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Because I receive some, you know, things like that from the movies, from the books, from the you know from the art and from the storytelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I felt like it changed me, shaped me, you know?</span></p>
