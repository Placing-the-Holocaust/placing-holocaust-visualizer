<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Why would you have experienced more than your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, my sister, if there was any -- any anti-Semitic action on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , she certainly would run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> rather than get out and fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">So -- so it was a -- really different, she was not exposed as much as -- as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And I -- I -- you know, I-I sort of lived through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I belonged to -- when I got older I belonged to a sport club called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ha-Koah</span> , the word stands for strength, and I was in the wrestling section. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So all of these guys -- I was like a mascot. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">In those days they were really national champs. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">They didn’t shy away from defending yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And it’s interesting when I think about it now, is what made my Judaism stronger then, and still is today is you cannot shy away. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">You must face, you must face anti-Semitism, if 1t exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">You -- you cannot just walk away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And even today when I see something that I feel -- and I’ve been in company of people that say things like, oh, I Jewed him down, as an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And perhaps this goes back to my childhood when I was -- I spoke up, and I defended myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  But what at that point gave you the strength to defend yoursel -- yourself, instead of to --
ANSWER:  Well, I -- th-that’s a very good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">You know, people say I’m proud to be a Jew, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">That’s -- but you have to know why you are proud, and I think because of my upbringing, both my mother and father, and then this teacher that I’m talking about, I felt good being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I never -- I never had to shy away, it was something that I was very proud of, but I knew why. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And so this, I think, made the difference, it’s the upbringing that makes the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Even today I have people that -- I live in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the south, and we have a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Bob Jones University</span> , and they always send people out trying to convert you. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They knock on my <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And both Trude, my wife and I, when we answer the <span class="DLF">door</span> , we say, you have the wrong address. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We are very happy with what we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Maybe you’re happy with what you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And so this -- you know, it carries forward, there’s no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we -- I think our children feel the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Let’s go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">You were talking about the fact that your family was very observant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Do you have fond memories of some of those observances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Probably the happiest time of my life, this may sound ridiculous, when we were the poorest. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And this was during the depression, I -- in Europe the depression started perhaps a little earlier than it did in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But my parents had practically lost their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And they refused to go into bankruptcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And so we had to give up our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we moved into one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My sister, myself, my mother and father, and occasionally my mother’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And on the Sabbath, in this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , when during the day we would not light -- there was no light, the most beautiful time was when later in the afternoon -- we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the morning, but later in the afternoon we would crawl in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with Mother and Father, and my father would tell these stories about he served four years in the war -- in -- on the side of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But my mother would sing the most beautiful Jewish songs, and most of them are very sad, but they were beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And we -- my -- we used to si -- we were lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> crying, not because we were unhappy, because we were happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I’ve learned a lot from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I -- I’ve learned to become really sentimental about my -- my Yiddish [indecipherable] and to appreciate li -- really life, because the songs deal with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So I would say 1-1f you say what gave it to me, and what -- what my life was like, this I think determined the way I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I remember at the end of the day on the Sabbath, they turned the lights on, and they would sit down at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and they would divide the money they had earned -- they went to work for other people, and they divided the money that they had to pay the creditors. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And when things got better, my mother and father were able to get back into business. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My father was very proud of the name, he wouldn’t think of bankruptcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And again, that I think taught me a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So these were -- these were happy times, although they were tough times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Tell me about the Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Well, Jewish people were about 10 percent of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And it was a very rich life. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The Jews were involved in -- in the music, they were involved in -- in politics, they were involved certainly in the arts and sciences, and in teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And Jews, generally speaking, I would say, were quite influential. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were also -- not all of them were successful, but they were mostly successful people, and -- and very law abiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We didn’t -- we had nobody to be ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So Jewish life was a rich life, I would say, although I must tell you, sa -- when -- I go back now to -- to this sa -- during the day on Saturday, the thing that really touched me is my mother would tell us stories about her life as a teenager in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">She grew up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubachow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Her parents, I would say, were poor people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Very, very observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I still remember my grandfather, very much so because he was a very imposing man with a white beard, and -- but he always would tell me these stories, and my mother would tell us what happened to her as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">She was sent away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when she was not even 10 years old because the fear that they had of pogroms, when soldiers would come and rape girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They -- she and her sisters would hide under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And so one day they were sent to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak6éw</span> to a -- to a member of the family, and my mother, at age 10 or so, had to work for that family, although she lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She was like a -- she took care of the baby, she helped clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So when you hear from your own mother what -- what she went through -- but my mother was never bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The -- the thing that my mother always said, but look, here we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And thank God we are alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I -- I survived that. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So these are -- these are all part of my -- my make-up, and it was very meaningful to me to hear what my parents went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My father went -- was in the service for four years as I told you, he was wounded in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And yet, when Hitler came, it made absolutely no -- no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Neither my mother nor my father went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> would not have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And both my parents were self educated, and went in business self educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So as a result of that, education was the most important thing in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So it -- it all comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You know, people say, well, the Jewish people are so intent on education. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">This 1s a good reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That’s why. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And my mother would even write in her -- she -- she sometimes would keep a journal, which we found only recently, and it was very touching what she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She says, one day I had -- I prayed that my children would have a good education. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It’s the most important thing in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So -- so perhaps this gives you a -- a picture of what -- what it was like, life for me in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and generally life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But we had good times in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , too, we used to -- we used to go to balls, and -- during Mardi Gras season. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In fact, every summer we would have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and that’s where I met my -- my wife, when I was -- I was 17 and she was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the day I met her I told her I was going to marry her, and her father overheard it, and I was not his favorite person after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She was -- she was the only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  You spoke of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, and whether you went to <span class="BUILDING">integrated schools</span> --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  -- or whether you went only to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish institutions</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">No, I went -- when my -- my <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> was boys only, and that’s not unusual, it was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> for four years, it was totally integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We had -- in fact I had many non-Jewish friends when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And then after -- at age 10 1s when I finished <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , and stood an exam to enter into a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And that too was integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We had religion -- we took religion in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in contrast to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and this is -- that’s one reason why I feel so strong about not mixing religion with the state, because we -- when we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we had religion, but we had to leave our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish class</span> , so to speak, when others went to the <span class="BUILDING">Christian class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That was not very good, but -- but the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I experienced anti-Semitism then, where you know, you’d find scribbled notes, you Jew, or Jew go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Some of the professors we had, I felt were anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Maybe it’s because I didn't study that much, but some of them, on the other hand, I felt were very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So my schooling -- I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> not because I was genius, but the system was that you can finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> after four years, and I went to work as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I made the equivalent of maybe 20 dollars a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And while I, however, while I was working I went to a <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And while I was not a very good student in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> was really what I wanted, and I -- I -- I did quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So I worked and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  And what was the work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  I -- the sc -- the business that I worked for, they had five and 10 cent stores which they started, and in fact they were among the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they also would sell merchandise on consignment and put people in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And my work when I first started was sweeping floors and cleaning <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and that sort of thing, but within -- when I was 17, I was in charge of a department and I had learned about import/export, because a lot of the merchandise which we sold was imported. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I had taken all kinds of courses which enabled me to become a buyer for- for that company. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And a good many of the people that worked -- the company was owned by a Jewish man, and the people that worked there were both Jews and non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I must tell you this, we haven’t come to Hitler yet, but Hitler came in on a -- on a Friday, on, I believe it was March the 11". </span><span class="sentence" id="113">On Monday I went to work, we didn’t know what to do, so you go, like you always go, I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And the same people that I had worked with for several years already- this was 1937 -- is when -- ?</span><span class="sentence" id="115">38, excuse me, when Hitler came. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">The same people that I had worked with for several years suddenly appeared in Nazi uniforms with the swastika band. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The same people that I had lunch with every day, that I -- that I went out with, the very same people. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And that was a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And this -- this just tells you really, what went on, and how -- how life was. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">In a way we kidded ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We -- we kidded. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Although we had all of these fights and troubles, but never thought that 1t would get to a point as it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">What also happened is a man who worked for the owner of our company, that our owner had put in business, came in one day and took over the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Came in with a group of Nazis in black and brown uniforms and just took the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And ironically made out a receipt, and fired everybody, except three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And we were put into one <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , 1n one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we -- and the reason they didn’t fire us 1s the people they put in charge had to learn something. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I’m -- I’m trying to really give you a picture of -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- when I think about it, I’m really amazed myself of how we were so foolish prior to Hitler not to recognize, or not to sense that there was more to this than just having a fight in the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Let’s just backtrack, cause of course I -- I want you to tell me much more about when Hitler came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">You mentioned that there were fights in the s -- in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or scribbled notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Can you talk a little bit more about other hints, or -- or outright incidents of anti-Semitism prior to Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Well, of course the Nazi party had started many, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And in fact, they killed a chancellor, his name was Dollfuss, several years before Hitler came into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But it was after 1933, where Hitler came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where he took over the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And those people, his followers, killed Dollfuss, and they were put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So there was always that unrest, and there was always -- <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had maybe 10 - 15 political parties, and there were marches in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It’s -- it’s quite different than it 1s here. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And it always resulted in -- in fights and even killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There was -- the anti-Semitism that you could feel in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was that sometimes you could not live where you wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You were rejected on a job because you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So it -- it wa -- it wa -- those kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But we lived with it, and this was -- you almost get used to a way of life, that’s just the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And so you -- you live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When people came -- we had somebody in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I worked who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> and he told us stories about that Jewish businesses were taken over, and Jews were beaten and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I must tell you the truth, we didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We thought oh, there must be something wrong with that man. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Why would they do anything like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So there was a difference between political national socialism and the anti-Semitic part of anti -- o-of that fascism. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was either political, but it was also anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So it was in that atmosphere that we grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Maybe I felt it more than others because I was in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish club</span> , and maybe because of the <span class="REGION">section</span> where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Maybe I was more aware of it because of the education that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And my mother, the stories that she would tell me, I -- I was sort of on the -- I -- I had like an antenna. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">You -- you get sensitive where you -- where you feel these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Were you beaten up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  I was beaten up and I beat up. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I did it both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Oh definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I -- I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> sometimes with a bloody nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But I also came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I felt very triumphant, where I gave somebody a bloody nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  But none of this taunting -- was that disturbing to you, or that surprising to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Didn’t you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- and talk to your family and say why is this happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  No, not really, because I knew the history of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Not only my mother’s experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but I knew about the Spanish Inquisition. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I knew what happened in Europe, in many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where Jews lived, and then came another king or another prince or another chancellor, and Jews had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I knew all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I had -- I had heard stories from my grandfather in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , who told me what -- what he had experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So this -- you know, this was the history of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I accepted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">That was the way life was, and -- and the more -- the more they -- the more they were after us, the stronger we became, I felt, at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It’s like when you -- when you hunt an animal, the fox becomes very fast and clever, because it hunted in -- in a way, that’s the way it was, certainly with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Now you went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> or <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> , but they were mixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Were your friends mixed, or were your friends Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Most of my friends were Jewish, but some of them, of course, were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And one of the bad experiences I had after Hitler came was with a friend, a non-Jewish friend that I had known for many, many years, who in fact belonged to the same club, the sport club that I belonged to. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he is the one that threw me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and made me scrub the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And when I wanted to pull my pants up not to make -- make them wet, he -- he pulled them down, and he called me a [indecipherable] a pig Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That was perhaps the greatest shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Can you imagine that you -- you sort of grew up with somebody and suddenly this is what happens to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">You really feel, when something like that happens, you feel 1t perhaps more because of the disappointment, because it’s something I did not expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Fighting on the <span class="DLF">street</span> I -- I expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You know, that -- it really didn’t bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But this was a betrayal, I was betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So when you ask me about friends, I’m not saying that every one was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Most of my non-Jewish friends would not have anything to do with me after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That -- and this, in a way, I -- I expected that. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I -- I -- I just -- they were protecting themselves, and at that point I was much more interested with what was going to happen to us, could we get out, than if somebody spoke to me or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  But it must have been tremendously hurtful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Oh, it was very hurtful, 1t was very hurtful. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">One time I was surrounded by a group of people -- when I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was telling you about, th-the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> while I was working, and one time I was surrounded by maybe 10 or 15 people my age that I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, who threatened to beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And if it hadn’t been for a police officer -- and that was unusual by the way, that a police officer would interfere, because normally they looked aside, I would have been beaten to a pulp, I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was hurtful. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Th-There’s no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But you know, it just didn’t get me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">This is where my father’s faith comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I knew that some -- we -- we had to get out, there was no question about that, and we did not go to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">It’s interesting, with all the troubles, Jewish people would still tell jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">When -- when all these -- these bad things happened, they would still tell jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They would still talk about normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">You don’t just give up everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That’s the way life was, you -- you went on, you tried to do -- live as normal as you could, which really wasn’t normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Because I remember my mother and father had -- or everything they had, their bank account was confiscated after Hitler, and we lived from what my mother had saved -- and I often tell Trude I hope you have some money somewhere I don’t know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And after awhile when that ran out, we began to sell, like my mother liked silver and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And this is what we lived from. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">My mother made -- I -- every day we ate like potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Meat was hardly ever, but never complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We never -- we never complained about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So I -- I don’t know how others reacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We were glad that we -- we were still alive, we were hopeful that we would get out, and of course we -- we -- we did get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I -- I -- I don’t want to talk about the beatings that people took, and what we saw on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It is indescribable in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It’s -- it’s unbelievable that this happened to people that confessed to be God fearing -- I mean that people who -- who said they believe in God, went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , went to concert, loved music, loved literature, that these are the very same people that turned into -- to beasts, and then came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and loved and hugged their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So it was a tough time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  This probably does take us up to, you know, what happened in March of -- of 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Because you -- you’ve mentioned that you knew a little bit of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but you didn’t either believe it or --
ANSWER:  We -- we did not -- we knew a little bit, we did not know everything, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And also you have to remember during those years there were not -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> had not started yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Businesses were confiscated, laws were passed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that for instance a Jewish doctor could -- did not cre -- treat a non-Jewish patient and the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">That Jews could not employ non-Jews, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Those -- those were the laws that were passed, but there were no -- no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was always a rumbling going on, and Hitler proposed that <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> be annexed to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was to be taken, I believe it was on the 13" of March, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The chancellor, the Austrian chancellor at that time, his name was Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden two or three days before the vote was taken -- or to be taken and told Hitler that we’re fighting it, we’re not -- we’re not going to just accept this, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Well, on Friday before election, I was outside of the business, I had been at a meeting, and it was in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And of course there was a lot of literature about how to vote, vote yes or vote no and that sort of thing, but you didn’t see any swastikas. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And in the afternoon, within one hour, word got out that Hitler’s troops had marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and I have never seen a people more organized than the Austrians were. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Police officers put on swastika bands, <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> flew the -- the -- the swastika flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were already out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> looting. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And this all happened within -- within an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It was highly organized, and I must tell you, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was really not taken over, because <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was happy to become part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The people were jubilant, they were absolutely jubilant. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They were not victims, the Austrians were not victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They were part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I -- I remember this was on a Friday and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> immediately, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I said, what are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And my mother said, “It’s Shabbas, it’s Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We’re gonna have a -- we gonna have Sabbath.” </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And believe it or not, we sat down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> -- Friday was a -- was a wonderful day in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , everything was cleaner, it smelled more -- better. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It was really like a festival. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">My mother said this is Shabbas, we’re going to sit down, we’re going to have our meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She lit the candles, she prayed over the candles, we had our meal, my father said the prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And then, after that is when we really began to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But this -- that -- the -- the ritual of the Friday night service remained, in fact it probably was the most meaningful Friday night we ever spent. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There was great strength there, and great faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Well, now I must tell you what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I'll go back a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">In 1937, on -- this is when we went to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the summer and rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I met my wife, I told you about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I immediately fell in love with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But the week when I met her, for some unexplainable reason -- my father would commute and he would come in on a Friday and stay til Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">On Thursday, I cannot tell you why, Pll never know why, I decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and come back on Friday with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And everybody said, why you going, you just met Trude, and I said, I just feel like going. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And when I got off the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I met a boy friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And he said, what are you doing this evening? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And I said, I really have no plans, I don’t even know why I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He said, why don’t go we -- why don’t we go dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And so I met him that evening and we went to an <span class="BUILDING">outdoor restaurant</span> where there were -- where there was dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I -- in -- in Europe it is quite appropriate that you can get up from your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , walk over to -- to a lady and ask her to dance, and if she says no, you -- you know, you’re a little embarrassed, but you go back to your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So I had noticed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a -- 1t was obvious that they were Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">There were five girls and a chaperone. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I said to my friend, I says, you know this -- this -- there’s one girl there, I really like her looks and I’m going to ask her to dance with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">If she says no, I’m going to walk out, cause I’m not going to come back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and be embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So I paid my bill and I walked over, and in German -- I couldn’t speak English, I asked the chaperone, may I dance with one of the girls, and they looked me over, and they agreed, and I asked this girl to dance with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we danced until the <span class="NPIP">place</span> closed, about one o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And then I asked the chaperone, may I come the next day on Friday and take this young lady for a walk and show her Vienna, and they -- after a conference they agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And so the next day I -- I bought a little dictionary, and I picked her up at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we made -- we walked for about two hours, made conversation through this dictionary. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I took her back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and she by the way was -- she had just graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so she was just about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I said, give me your name and address, and I will learn how to speak English and then I will write to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So she gave me her name and address, and her name was Mary Mills, she lived on <span class="DLF">Mills Avenue</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> , <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> , U.S.A. And I took that address and I put it in my wallet. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Then on Friday evening I came back to the <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> and I told Trude, “Guess what, I danced with an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And Trude says, “I could care less.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="271">She wasn’t too impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Well, I saved that address, and now go back -- I go forward, Friday night after si -- after we had our meal, I said to my parents, “You know, you remember I met this girl in -- in fisil -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , after I had come back from the <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I have her address, I’m going to write to her and see if she will help me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And my parents said, “She’ll never remember you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I says, “Well, we’ll see.” </span><span class="sentence" id="276">In fact, I told that to -- to Trude, my -- now my wife, and she said, “Good luck and good weather.” </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I wrote to her and I still have a copy of that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I remember I wrote the letter in German and then I took each word and translated it to English so the -- the grammar is not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But she -- the letter I wrote to Mary Mills, she understood what I was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I -- I said to her in the letter, perhaps you will remember me. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I must get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">If you will help me, I promise you Ill never be a burden to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And that was in March of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And several weeks went by and I did not hear from her, and one day -- I think I was with Trude at their <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , if I’m not mistaken -- I get a call from my father, you have a registered letter from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I cannot tell you what that felt like. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I opened up the letter, it said, I have not forgotten you. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I have gone to see a man here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> , who promised that he would help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">His name 1s Shepherd Saltzman, he owns a <span class="BUILDING">shirt factory</span> , and he said that he would send you the necessary papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There’s no way that I can tell you [indecipherable] we were very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And this is really how I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">This man helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He later told me, he said, “When Mary came to see me, I said to her, how can I not help, when I a Jew -- when you a Christian want to help, and I as a Jew, how can I not help?” </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So he sent me an affidavit that would guarantee that I would not be a burden to the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">In the affidavit he said, if there’s anybody else in your family that you want to come with you, let me know. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Well, we didn’t the chutzpah, the gall to -- to ask for more, but then when things got worse, and my sister had a very close call, frightening experience, we sent a telegram to this man and said, would you include my sister Paula? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And he wired back to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> to include her. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And so my sister and I came here -- came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the end of July 1938, and left my parents behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  I want to backtrack. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I know that this is difficult to talk about, but I think what’s important for those of us who were not there to understand 1s -- is really the mood and the circumstances of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> after the Germans essentially annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  How your life was changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I think that’s really important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  Well, let me start off how my life was changed, on -- on the out -- on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">How did -- how did we know that there was a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The following week after Hitler marched in, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> were already marked no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">No Jews allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">That following week, Jews were dismissed from their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">That following week, some <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burning, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were broken into. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that took, especially groceries, out of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">In our own case, our bank account was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The customers my parents had stopped paying. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">What I saw was neighbor turning against neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">If -- 1f some people wanted to have a certain <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they would go to the -- to the government and say so and so has said something about the German, and the result was that they had to move out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And I’Il give you an example, happened in -- in my wife’s case, Trude and her family were ordered out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and given six hours to get out, and they had to find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And that other <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they lived was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But that’s how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">How was life otherwise? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">People disappeared, people were scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">When I heard anybody walking in back of me, there was a fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">A fear I cannot explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I remember one night, about 11 or 12 o’clock, there was a knock on our <span class="DLF">door</span> , and our first thought was oh my God, the Gestapo is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I open up the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and it was a -- aman who said, I’m a conductor, train conductor. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I have an envelope for you from your family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">My father had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and my mother had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And they’ve said to tell you to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I said to this conductor, tell them they better get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">See, the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were in the same position that we were about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">People in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> thought this -- they’re going to be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We already felt that there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> in Europe for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So life was -- people were already, as I told you -- we had a friend in our family who was picked up by the Gestapo, he was put into a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and he wa -- with -- with a group of other Jews, and he was told, say your last prayers, we’re gonna -- you’re gonna be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they did it in alphabetical order, they would call. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">His name was Lang, L- a-n-g. They called people in alphabetical order. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">In the -- in the -- in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , people were already saying their Shema, hear oh <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the last prayer that you say before death. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And when he came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , they were shooting 1n the <span class="DLF">air</span> and laughing, and then kicked him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But in the meantime, some people died of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I mean, it was that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And I remember we used to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> at <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , hoping to get -- there were always rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Oh, you can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , you can go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">You can get a visa here or there. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we would stand all night, waiting to get into the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And the young Hitler youth would come in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they would throw horse manure at us, and the police would stand there and laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So what -- what was life like, 1t was -- it -- it’s very hard to -- for people to understand how we even survived mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And yet we -- we would -- we would try to listen to the radio, although it was forbidden -- foreign -- foreign broadcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And yet we -- during all that time we still hoped -- we said, oh well, maybe <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is not going to allow this to happen, and maybe <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> will -- will do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Maybe <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> will do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">There was still that hope that somebody was going to come to our rescue. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And you know what I learned? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The world does not hear tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You can cry, and cry, nobody hears you. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The world does not hear you cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And that’s exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We were crying, but nobody was listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So that’s -- that’s what life was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  You continued to go to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Until I -- but just for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I still have a copy of the letter, saying you’re discharged, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I worked, I think, until May.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  And then they discharged you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  Oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They discharged me within a week of -- after he took over, and gave me a letter -- I have a letter of recommendation, which 1s ridiculous, but -- what a good worker I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But they discharged me, as of -- I’ve forgotten the date exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  So when you describe police or soldiers or Hitler youth, are we talking about Germans or Austrians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Austrians more than Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It’s very interesting that -- that you ask me that question, because I had some narrow escapes where I was saved by a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I remember one time, Trude’s father had loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and he had a brand new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And one day I came to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she said, “They came and got my father’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They just -- they gave us a receipt, they took the keys.” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I says, “They can’t do that, how can they do this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And like a fool I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , and there hundreds of people were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> because they had been called to come to the Gestapo, and I, like a schmoe stand there, and suddenly a -- a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">staff car</span> , a German officer gets out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he takes a look at me and says, “Why are you here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And I tell him the story, he says, “Take my advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So this is -- this is one time when -- when a German really -- a German officer helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I had another experience -- you know, you gotta have some luck 1n life. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">People call it miracle, luck, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">In order to cu -- to get the visa from the Americans, we had to have a paper from the Austrian government saying that we had no -- committed no crime, and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">My sister applied for it and I did, and hers came back and mine didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And in the meantime I received a letter from the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> saying your papers are ready, but when you come be sure you have this and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Included in that was the letter from the government that I was not a criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And it was just two or three days before I was supposed to get my visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And if you don’t have the papers, they pass you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So I stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> again for hours and hours with my mother, to this -- to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I finally come upstairs and this German, he says what do you want, and I tell him what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I plead with him, he says, I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">It’ll take days and days and days to -- to search your record. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And while I’m talking to him, a young girl walks up, and calls him aside, and they -- two of them look at me, and they whisper, and he comes back to me and he says, if I have your word that you will not tell this to anybody, come back this afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">This -- this young lady has agreed to spend the rest of the day just on your case. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I come downstairs and my mother said, what happened, and I squeezed her arm, which I tried to show her it’s good, because I was afraid to say anything in front of anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You know, you save your own skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I come back in the afternoon, he hands me the papers and he said, I must tell you, he says, “I’m a nationale socialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I’m a national socialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I’m a political one. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I never, never thought this would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I wish that I could go with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He says, “And you will do well in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I wish you luck.” </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So I -- you -- you sort of -- you -- you -- you lived by your experiences, and what I have learned is, with all these terrible experiences that we have, there is somebody good. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And I live on the good experiences, rather than the bad ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">If I didn’t, I don’t think I could have survived mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And so I grew up and I matured, and tried not to hate, because that -- hate eats you up, it doesn’t -- it doesn’t hurt the one you hate, it hurts -- it hurts you. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">For every bad that I had -- not for every, but look, I had a Christian girl save my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I had these people that helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And the others, those that -- the real -- I -- I can’t even find a word for them, that behaved like they did, I -- I -- I -- I try to forget -- somebody once asked me, have you forgiven? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And I said, that kind of crime requires a greater -- a greater force than what I am, to forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">That is not up to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They gonna have to answer to a greater being than -- than to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And -- and this is -- this is the way I feel, and this 1s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I cannot -- I cannot -- nobody can imagine how these people acted. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I must tell you, they were overjoyed, the Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They were overjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I mean, here is Hitler promising -- don’t forget, 10 percent of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ’s population was Jewish, and -- and it was a -- basically a thriving community. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And Hitler says to these people, you see, all that they have, you will have. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">You can have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Just take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So they were -- they were -- they were pro -- pro-Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  When the Germans came in, were there German troops in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They -- at first, in fact, my God, there was a parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The German soldiers, they parading. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">He -- they probably picked the -- the best looking ones, and the people were jubilant. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Unfortunately, some of the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> welcomed Hitler, issued proclamation welcoming Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Sure, there were -- there were German troops, but they didn’t have to stay there, because the Austrians were very happy to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The Austrian police was like -- was Hitler supporters, there’s no question about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  Now in the early days, as I understand it, there was a lot of chaos, a lot of sort of uncontrolled violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And from what I’ve read, that after some time, and I don’t know how much time, that sort of the efficiency of the German machine demanded that -- that that chaos be controlled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Well, they actually, y-y-you remember the story about Kristallnacht, and I think that was in November of 1938, what the government actually said, on this and this day, you can go out and do what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You go ahead, break -- break the -- the <span class="DLF">store windows</span> , go ahead and beat up people. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Go, do what you want, you’ve got 24 hours to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So it was the government that controlled the chaos, you’re right. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But individuals, that doesn’t -- didn’t mean that individuals did not perform violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But the government controlled -- which was even worse than if it were just a riot on the part of people, cause by that time they already began to build <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and they had passed all these different laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The Nuremberg Laws became the Austrian laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So that -- it was a -- 1t was a very well organized effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  I guess my question here is, how long did it take after March 13" for things to settle down a little bit, and for the government, German or Austrian, to really take charge in a -- in a systematic way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Well, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in July, the end of July 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">By that time it was not systematic, it was still -- some of it was systematic yes, if you wanted to take over a business, if a -- if -- if'a Austrian wanted to take your business, and they would have a friend who 1s a Nazi, they were so well organized that they gave you a receipt. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Now, I’m not being facetious. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So when I left there was still that -- that sort of thing going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">In fact, I would say, after that is when it became more regulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But that didn’t mean that you didn’t fear of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The difference was that it wa -- the -- the uniform people that came, it was the Gestapo people who came for you, rather than an individual ho-hoodlum, if that’s -- if that’s what you mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Yeah, well, I -- I -- I mean, I can’t imagine that this massive violence and looting and beating that s -- that began immediately, went on continuously for months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  No, no, n-no, you’re right, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It -- it was still there, but not -- not in the same force. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">At first people were evidently told, do what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And that was an outlet for them, I mean, they were so happy that Hitler came because now they could loot. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Now, if they wanted our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Now, if they wanted our business, they got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So that was at first, and then, of course it became more regulated because the government stepped in and built the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , an-and that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  But this cra -- this real craziness, did it last two weeks, two months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  N-No, it lasted several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It lasted several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But the -- the fear did not leave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Perhaps the fear was even greater because the -- because the government without a doubt, took over the violence, or controlled the violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  And when you speak of the government, I don’t mean to be [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  The Austrian government, the Austrian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But they had put in -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> put in a -a--a-- like a governor let’s say, you could call it, a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Or they found an Austrian who had been a Nazi, and made him the mayor, let’s say. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They also released all the political prisoners who had been put in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because they killed, like this Chancellor Dollfuss, who was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">His killers were let -- were let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So it -- that was all well thought out, and this -- this is how that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Okay, why don’t we stop right here and change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">End of Tape One Beginning Tape Two
QUESTION:  Now you were discharged from your business, and it took you a few months to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">How did you spend your time in those few months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Well, most of the time we would go and stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> , trying to get information about how to get out, 1-is there a -- a -- a possibility of getting a visa to certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">That’s how most of the time was spent almost -- almost every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The rest of the time, I -- I visited friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">There was really nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I did not walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> if I could help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">You stay as low as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You try not to be noticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">In fact, my father and mother, who were Polish citizens -- I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- because of that, I was considered a pole -- a citi -- a Polish citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And so I -- people started like a business of emblems that you wear, and so I wore a Polish emblem, to indicate that I will -- was a Polish citizen, thinking that that would protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And anybody who had anything that they could wear, they would put on. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Of course, if you were a Nazi, you put in your lapel the button, the swastika button. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And so I carried this, thinking maybe this -- this would protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Th -- well, evidently it did, although, you know, I was pushed off the <span class="DLF">street</span> , did not walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> with somebody else and that -- that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Well how did people know you were a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Well, I was not blonde and blue di -- blue eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I lived in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , and people -- by the way, we had to carry an I.D. card that indicated that we were Jewish, an-and that’s one reason why I’m opposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I hope to God it never happens here. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But so they knew if I had been picked up, they knew, of course, that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And if I did not wear a swastika, I was suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So I think it was very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It’s either you wore a lapel button or an armband, or you didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So it wasn’t -- it was not very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  Was the identity card the new thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  No, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  You’d always had those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, always had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">In fact, when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , when my parents send me to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> to take money out, and the system is different, you -- you -- you go to the teller, you put in your check, you get a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And I guess they check and see if you have the money in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And then they call your number. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">When my number was called, they said to me, your -- your account is closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">That -- that -- that -- that’s how it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  Were you ever put on any work details, or --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  -- rounded up, or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  Oh, I was rounded up to wash the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I told you that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Well, you actually didn’t describe that very much in this interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  Well, I was walking -- I was walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , in fact, I was walking with a girl, other than Trude, and forgive me Trude, and minding my own business when across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there was this action, called an action. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> had been full of paint in anticipation of the vote, so there would be all kinds of lettering in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And what they did, is they picked up Jews, and they made them clean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I was walking in the opposite side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> when this -- this fellow who I thought was my friend, grabbed me and pulled me over, and made me -- made me clean the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">That’s exactly how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And that wa -- that was a -- a tremendous shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">A-Aside from that, you know, like I told you what happened at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I was surrounded by people, I was not beaten up, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  Were you shoved off of <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, that, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Shoved, or I would just be plain cursed at. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">People just -- some people just took pleasure in simply cursing you. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">The -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived had maybe 25, maybe 30 <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , and it was already even with our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> rather, there were Jews and non-Jews living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And some of the non-Jews already started to take over <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that the Jews lived in, that they liked better. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So there was neighbor turning against neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We had a superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> who was not Jewish, who would warn us, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He -- he was a pretty good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Would warn us if they saw, you know, Nazis coming, to lay low. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It was -- it was -- ye -- you learned not to really -- I hate to say that, not to trust anybody, because you live in constant fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It reminds me sometimes of how cattle herded into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and they’re taken to slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And somehow, this is what happens to you as a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">You begin to develop fear like you feel like you’re being herded. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Yo -- you -- you -- you change. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">You change because you don’t -- you even walk different, you -- you -- you don’t -- you’re just a totally different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And unless you live through it, you -- you wouldn’t- you wouldn’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We didn't realize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We did not realize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The -- the -- when I saw a uniform, it scared me. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It sc -- when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , when I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and I saw police officers talking to people as friends, I could not get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I -- I met a -- the man who brought me over was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to pick me up, and he was with a -- a -- a gentleman and he introduced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He said, this is Rabbi Mezuer. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I looked at the man, and I called Shep Saltzman aside and I said, “He’s not a rabbi, he’s a spy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="536">He said, “Why in the world would you say that?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I said, “Well, he’s clean-shaven, he does not wear a skullcap and he speaks perfect German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Anybody, when you hear that German in back of you, you have fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I mean, that -- this is what happens to you in just a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Fortunately, the wounds heal, if you -- it -- it’s just like anything else, if you cut yourself and -- and there’s an infection, it keeps on going and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">If you let it heal there’s a scar, the scar never leaves you. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The scar is there, but it doesn’t fester. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And so all this that you go through, if you’re fortunate enough you can survive it and still live a normal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  During this few months that you stayed over there, did you continue to observe the Sabbath, did you have a Passover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  Yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We observed, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">It -- it was perhaps even more meaningful, more meaningful than ever, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The -- the question that perhaps underlying your -- your question is did you lose faith, and no we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">This is -- my father would always say, don’t worry, God’l help. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I told you before, that’s the way he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Oh, don’t worry, God -- God is going to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">No, we did not -- we -- we did not go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because I -- one of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> was a very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we went to, and that one was -- was demolished, totally demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So whatever services were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and sometimes a -- a friend would come over, or a relative would come over, and you sit together, and you observe the Friday night, and I must say that the food was not as good as it was before, but that -- that really -- that -- that didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">You -- you cannot -- you cannot lose hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">If you -- if you lose hope --
QUESTION:  Sorry. [</span><span class="sentence" id="556">interruption] The meals weren’t just good because you couldn't afford the food, or because food was rationed and there just wasn’t much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, we didn’t have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Because as I told you, we -- in fact, my mother started to, at the beginning would go to the <span class="BUILDING">pawn shop</span> and it was -- it was called [indecipherable], 1t was run by the government, and would pawn things. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">But then after a few weeks we realized that this is not going to get better. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">There was no sense to pawn it when you know you can’t get it back, so we began to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And there you got a little more money, and this is what we lived off. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So this -- and we did get some money from relatives, both in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The relatives that sent us money through this train conductor, half of the money went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">That was his -- his take, because he put his life in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So we had some of that money, we -- we -- we had paid for the ticket on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We took -- when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> we took eight -- the equivalent of eight dollars in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was paid for. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And then I had prepaid I think something like 10 or 20 dollars that I could s -- that was part of the travel expense, that I could spend on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I had left a dollar and 60 cents, out of that eight dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  How -- you mentioned that peop -- you -- you lined up along with other people every day to try to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Was there an immigration policy in place at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  Wa -- how easy was it for people to get out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  Well, you could only get out if you could get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">In other words, you could not get out unless you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And most of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> did not want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">For instance if you escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , which is what happened to my wife, the <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> government would give you a 30 day permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then you have to come and register again, and if you’re lucky you get another 30 day permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So it was not easy to get out unless you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The world simply did not want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">What’s the use of kidding? </span><span class="sentence" id="584">When I compare, as an example, what happened in -- in recent history, under President Carter, where maybe 100,000 or more Cubans were let in, there was no such thing where the American government say well, come. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Or -- or not just the American government, any of the other governments. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">That did not happen then. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So, we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, nobody wanted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But there were always rumors that -- yeah, you could get, I think into <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> if you had the equivalent of maybe 10,000 dollars or so, but who had it? </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I mean, we -- it was taken away from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So we -- we didn’t -- when my mother and father ultimately left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , all they had left in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Everything else was either taken or sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">That’s -- if you can visualize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">When I went through it, my -- my sister and I, Paula left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I did not know that I would ever see my mother and father again. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">In fact, that was the saddest day in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">They took us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , of course, and we pulled down the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of -- on the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and we held hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move, and my mother and father walked with us first, and then ran as long as they could, holding hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And then we no longer could hold hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And we pulled out, and they became smaller and smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I never thought I would see them again, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">These are the -- these are the kind of things that stay with you all your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Fortunately they -- they were able to come over, there was another miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">A -- a woman at the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> was helpful for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">When I went to get my papers at the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> , you stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> -- you’re scared to death anyhow, you don’t know what’s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">You go through a physical exam, and you have all your papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And there was a -- a woman sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I liked her looks, and I said to my mother, “I like her looks, I want her to examine my papers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We come to her, and she looks at my papers and she says, “Is this your mother?” </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I said yes. “</span><span class="sentence" id="608">Are your parents going with you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I don’t know what made me say it, I says, “No, but they will as soon as their affairs are straightened out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They had no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So she gets up -- I remember this vividly, and she takes my file and she puts it in a file. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">That’s all I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">When we received a wire from our mother and father saying we’re -- we’re coming in -- I think it was in -- I’ve forgotten the date in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And when they finally came, I didn’t have enough money to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to meet them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but I had enough money to call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I said, “Tell me, wha -- how did you get out?” </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And my mothers says, “Do you remember this woman at the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> ”? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">She called us and she says, are you ready to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">You have a special quota.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Because my sister and I were minors, they put us in a special quota and followed up, and this 1s how my mother and father came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">That -- that’s another miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Did you ever -- I’m trying to sort of imagine the mindset. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">It was very clear to you that you needed to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Did that ever get confused by sort of a feeling of desertion of your past and of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  Oh, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Not for a moment, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">There was no loyalty to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">What loyalty --
QUESTION:  But to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Never thought about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The only thing I would feel guilty, I said -- felt bad about, was leaving my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But it was quite clear, and my parents spoke about it, they said, “Look, you’re young, and we’ve already lived a lot of our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We’ ll manage somehow, with God’s help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">No, there was never a feeling of deserting anybody, or leaving anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">The first time I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , after having lived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for a number of years, I remember I -- I could not -- I couldn’t wait to show my American passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Oh, American. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">You don’t realize what that means to be an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And ti -- the man at the <span class="DLF">border</span> when you -- when you checked your -- your passport says, “Oh, you’ve -- you’ve come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I said, “Oh no, my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I never -- the only thing I -- I -- 1f I ever missed anything about <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was I get nostalgic when I hear the music, and some of the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But no, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Unfortunately we’ve been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> several times, but the last time I was there I experienced anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism, and I will never go back, never.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  How was the trip over, were you --
ANSWER:  It was wonderful, wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">You know, I was 18 - 19 years old, I -- we went second class, there were three classes on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French boat</span> , I met people. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And interestingly, I have to tell you this, I was kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I observed the Shabbas, and never smoked on the Sabbath, I never ate ham, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">When I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I asked the -- the headwaiter, I says, “Do you have a <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> ?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="653">Oh,” he says, “yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I say, “I want to see it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So he took me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I said, “Where is your <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> ?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="656">Oh,” he says, “this is kosher meat, and this is not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I says, “And that’s it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="658">He says, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I says, “Ill eat what everybody else does.” </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I mean, it -- 1t was a farce. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And then the other thing that happened to me, my sister caught me smoking, and she said, “My God Max, it’s -- it’s Shabbas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I had not realized that it was the Sabbath, you know, you lose track of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So that’s when I -- that’s really what happened to me, I -- Ino longer observed the dietary laws, and I -- I s -- smoked on the Sabbath, and of course worked on the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So my trip over was -- was really very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I met some people that I stayed in touch with for a -- a number of years, and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I was a -- my mother had two sisters who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , who never responded to our letters -- while I was there, let me add, but ultimately did write. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Well, anyhow, so I had cousin, picked me up, together with this man Shep Saltzman who brought me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And he said to me, he says, “I have a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">If you li -- want to stay with your cousin, come and then come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> in -- ina few days.” </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So I stayed with -- with my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">The first experience I had, and this 1s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They looked at me and says, “Oh you don’t look half dead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But -- but you -- you look okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They expected me to be a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And the only thing we could take with us was clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Then they told me, “Oh, you don’t wear these clothes here, this is -- this is not -- you have to wear American clothes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But make a long story short, I stayed with them for about two or three days, and then they -- they bought me the ticket, a train ticket, to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> , <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">My sister stayed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , that’s where my aunt lived, to see - she says, “Why don’t you go and see what it’s like?” </span><span class="sentence" id="679">My relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> said, why don’t you go and work for cousin Joe? </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We had a cousin who -- who had done quite well, he was an immensely wealthy man, who was a very good person, he gave every -- every immigrant a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And I said no, I’m going to <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So they bought me a pack of cigarettes and gave me a sandwich and I had a ticket and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> , <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Let me just -- before you go on, let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">When you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , was there anything that really struck you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  Oh God, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">There was freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Unbelievable feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I never had that feeling, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I mean, here you come off, after this experience scared to death, especially of uniforms, scared of hear a -- a German word, scared to move, or scared to have somebody walk in back of you, and here it’s just this mass of people, and people are laughing, and -- and it’s -- it’s unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You have to experience it. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">This -- this is -- was freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It’s a -- it’s a -- it’s a wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So this was -- it’s just like new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">If I had been given a -- a transfusion, it wa - it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I have never -- and I -- I was happy from the moment I got off. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I was -- I was happy to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I never had any doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">That -- that’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I never had any fear of the unknown, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I was so happy, I would have done anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And when I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> , for instance, the man who brought me over here, he was at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The girl I had met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , she was at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and he -- this Mr. Saltzman says, “Come, I'll take you to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But on the way -- this was around noon, he says, “Let me buy you lunch,” and I said, “No. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I -- I -- I’m going to pay for my own lunch.” </span><span class="sentence" id="706">You have to remember, I could get lunch for a nickel or a dime. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And he said, “No, let me pay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I said, “When I can afford to take you for lunch, then you can take me for lunch.” </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I was so concerned not to take charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I - | wanted to be on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I’m getting a little emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So I got in -- I -- I -- I paid for my soup, and then about noontime I went to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I started working right then, immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And they put me in the shipping department because his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> as the shipping department, and besides that, in order to sweep <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> you don’t have to be fluent in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I had learned a little English by the way, from the time I knew that I was coming until I got here, I learned enough to say hello, good-bye, I love you, or I see you later, you know, I -- I wouldn’t get lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But anyhow, so I started working in the shipping department, sweeping floors, carrying boxes and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">A very interesting thing happened to me the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I get a call from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , paging Max Heller, come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she says to me, a judge is here to see you, Judge Plyler. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I said, oh my God, they’re going to send me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">That’s the first thing I thought of. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">There was something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And here is this tall, handsome man, and he introduces himself and he said, “I am Judge Plyler, I have come to welcome you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">He says, “I’m -- I'll be president of a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> this fall, and I want you to think of my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I will see that you learn to speak English, we have students here that’ ll help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And that was my welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It means so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">A simple act of kindness can undo bitter things. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Just reaching out. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So, that was my beginning 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">My sister came several weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I lived with the -- with the family for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And I -- by the way, my first paycheck was nine dollars and 90 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">It was really 10 dollars, but 10 cents was for Social Security. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And I worked seven days a week, maybe 70 - 80 hours a week and I was very happy to. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I would have done anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So, after one week, I lived with this family who was a superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Came the end of the week, I said, “I want to pay you.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="741">No,” he says, “I don’t want you to pay me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I says, “I’m not going to stay free, I -- I have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I have nine -- I have nine dollars and 90 cents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I said, “I want to pay you or else I leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="745">He says, “No, you cannot pay me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So I had found out there was another Jewish family who took in <span class="DLF">borders</span> and they charged seven dollars a week to be a <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So I moved in with them, I paid my seven dollars, and I saved about a dollar, a dollar and a half a week out of the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And then, ultimately, I moved with the family that brought me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And they were wonderful to me, absolutely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And he gave my daughter -- my sister a job, and my sister came over and we both stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And -- and I insisted that I pay them. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I said, I will not -- and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And so she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I worked in the shipping department, and I'll never forget -- I remember a -- a few months after I came here -- I used to listen to the radio a great deal, this is how I learned -- I went to movies, which were 10 cents, I think, but listened to the radio and I | -- I learned by the sound, and -- English and -- and it -- it didn’t take me that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So one day I learned that there was a bill in the Congress -- I heard that on the radio, to have a minimum wage. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And it was to be 25 cents an hour, for 48 hours, I think, and time and a half over that. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And I says, oh my God, 48 times 25 is 14 dollars, I make 10, and overtime? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I was all for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And Ill never forget that, the republican -- I didn’t know the difference between democrats or republicans. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The democrats, however, I learned, proposed the minimum wage, and the republicans were -- opposed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">That’s when I became a democrat by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I fig- I figured I'll make 14 dollars an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And -- and of course the bill -- bill went through, and interestingly enough, after 48 hours, I checked out the time clock, I didn’t get time and a half, but they gave me money to have supper with. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And my work, I made progress in my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">A few months after I was in the shipping department, the foreman in the shipping department left. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And so I went to Mr. Saltzman, I said, “I'd like to have his job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He says, “How can you have his job, you can’t speak English.” </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I said, “Ill show them what to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He said, “Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I mean really, this is how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And I became foreman in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Then ultimately my parents came over and he gave my father a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And my mother and father moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Ironically, I became my father’s boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I mean, he was a man, he was 50 -- he was 50 years old when he came here, and here I was, 19 at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And I told him what to do, and he schlepped the boxes just like I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Never complained, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">It wa -- never a -- not for a moment did we complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and ultimately I was able to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and a -- I made progress in my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">The internal sales manager left. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I was lucky, they were all leaving, and I -- again I went to -- to the owner of the business, I said, “Give me a chance for this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He says, “But how you gonna correspond with customers, you have -- I said, don’t worry, I’ll learn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So I would stay every night, and I go through the files and I memorized letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I found out after awhile, well, if you have 10 letters, different situations, pretty much that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So I gave numbers to the letters and I had a secretary that would type them, and I’d say number two, number three. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And this is -- and I was very fortunate with -- given an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I also learned that if you want something, you have to ask for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">That man was wonderful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">The day I met him, I said, “I'll never leave you unless I can go in business for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">That’s the only time when -- when I will leave you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Well, Trude in the meantime -- you remember Trude, came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">She had a much harder time than I did getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">She escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and had terrible experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And in 1942, we were -- we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">She came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1940, and we married in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And her mother and father came to -- came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> with her, and her uncle did. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">This same man, this Mr. Saltzman who had given a job to my father, to my sister, now he gave a job to her father and her uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He was a -- this man was -- was an angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He rests in peace, I can tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Then, after -- I made my -- and Trude, my wife, she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">She -- she worked 1n the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  Can I just ask what -- when did your parents finally get out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  In November of 1938, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So the whole family, we were all working at the <span class="BUILDING">shirt factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And -- and I had made progress there, I -- I was there -- after six years, seven years, I became a -- a vice president of the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He was very good to me, he -- he said, “I’Il let you buy one percent of the business, and the way you pay for it is from the profit.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And so I owned one percent of the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Ultimately I did go in business for myself in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I went in business, I left him. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He was, I would say rightfully so, he was upset, because he had been wonderful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But I always wanted to be in business for myself, and we had saved up about 10,000 dollars, because every time I was promoted, I would get a very nice increase, and my wife worked, and I worked, and we -- we were careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">W-We never had a credit -- a charge card until we had enough money to know that we can pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So anyhow, I went in business with a partner in 1946, and went into the shirt business in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because I didn't want to be competitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And after two years we split. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And he remained with the business, and I had more money than I thought ever existed, because we had done well in those two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But as partners we did not get along, and we had a buy or sell agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So after I sold my share of the business, a few days later I went in business for myself, and my only partner was my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I started a company called <span class="BUILDING">Maxon shirt company</span> , and that was in 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And the company did well, and we, in the meantime we had three children, three wonderful children, two daughters and a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We had bought our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">It was modest, and -- but we paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And so I went into business, as I said myself, and that was in 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">14 years later I sold that business, and that was a philosophical decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">First of all we learned that you don’t worship money. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And Trude and I felt the same way about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">| had met a friend of mine who had very bad business problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And he -- I noticed that he was really beside himself, and I -- I said this -- this -- I just won’t let this happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And so I said, I don’t want to be the richest man in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And we had a chance to either go public, or sell the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I told Trude, I said Trude, “I -- I want to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">How do you feel about it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And she says, “If that’s what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">What are you going to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I said, “Don’t worry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="835">So in 1962, after in business 14 years, I sold the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And I stayed with the business for five years, I had a contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I was active in the community as soon as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">My first experience in community work was with a group of Christian women who were interested to do something about first and youthful offenders. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">It was my first involvement, and I became deeply interested in that when we were able to get laws changed where youthful offenders were separated from hardened criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And I continued to be quite active in the community, including, of course, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , president of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and every Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And then one day I received a call saying there’s a rumor that you are interested to run for mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I thought -- that had never, never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But I had been involved do something about housing for the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I became very interested in that, and I started a housing foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And wherever I turned, I found that the government is involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And I said no, I -- I’m not going to run for mayor, but maybe I’Il run for city council, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And so I was elected for -- on a two year term. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And then after two years the -- the term of the mayor was up. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I -- I ran for mayor and I was elected, about 70 percent of the vote. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Interestingly enough, I ran as a democrat, I had no opposition from the republicans, but I had oppositions from the democrats, and they -- the fellow who ran against me came to me one day, and he says, “You know, God came to me and said that I should run against you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="851">This is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And I says, “Well God never said anything to me about you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Well, make a long story short, I -- I was elected, and I was mayor for a -- two four year terms, eight years. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I also ran for the Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">At the end of -- we -- we -- I proposed the term limitations. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I felt like eight years 1s plenty, and so I could not run again and this -- the congressional seat was open, and so I ran for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And I won the primary, but I lost the election. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Some of that experience was anti- Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I had -- I had some anti-Semitic experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I’m not saying that’s why I lost, but the fact is -- what happened was 30 days before the election a third candidate entered and he, on Thursday before the election he called a news conference saying that Max Heller is not fit to serve because he does not believe in Christ. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And when you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , in time of need, who are you going to call on? </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And I -- I thought this was ridiculous, everybody knew that I was Jewish, and -- and I -- I really -- I said -- my response was that people are not going to believe any of -- I mean, make this an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">My wife told me, she says, “You’re making a mistake, you ought to really fight this hard.” </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I said, “Look, it’s Thursday, the election is Tuesday.” </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Well, make a long story short, I -- I lost the election by maybe two percent, and then consequently I was asked by the governor of the state if I would serve as chairman of the state development board -- economic development, which is equivalent to secretary of commerce. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I did that -- we did that, I should say, for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And that was a very good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And then consequently of course, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">We lived in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Our children grew up, we -- we had wonderful, wonderful family. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">We now have 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, and two great-grandchildren on the way, and we have -- we had a wedding not long ago, one of our granddaughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">We have another one coming up in four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">We’ve been very fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">We have good children, we have good grandchildren, and I must say that they -- if there’s one thing that they have done that I am proud of, there is no intolerance, no bigotry in those children or grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And they’ve had some experiences where -- one of my grand -- one of my children came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> crying and says, so and so said that I killed Christ. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But it didn’t -- that did not change their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So they grew up very, very good -- I have a lot of -- very, very much to be grateful for, and I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I am very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I’ve devoted, I’d say, the last 30 years of my life -- I should say we, because my wife is the same way, for the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And I’ve had no regrets to be out of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I got enough money when we sold the business to manage it careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And we’ve had no [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I’m not the richest man in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , I never want to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And we -- we thank every God -- every day that we are here, we are grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And we’ve told that to -- to our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">We tell it to -- we -- both my wife and I, we speak in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , we speak in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And I think it’s important that people hear this message. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We often think that when we are dead, when this generation dies, it becomes a history in the books, or on videotape. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And I think that’s one reason I consider it very important to do this interview, because this should not be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I wish that we had today copies of interviews that were done hundreds of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">All we have is mouth to ear, and written. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And somehow, written history is not as powerful as when you can see it, or hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And I respect what is being done today, so that the -- the world should not forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">There has to be a lesson in all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I don’t know -- we often wonder how -- how -- really, how did this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">We lost 90 people in the Holocaust, 90 of our family were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">One cousin survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">She and four of her siblings and her mother and father were alive until the day when the Americans -- and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and the day when the Americans came in, the Nazis took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and ran over her family and everyone was killed except she. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">How in the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="902">How can we forget that? </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And as I said before, these are the very same people, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and for that matter <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the Poles did their share of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">They had more <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">The Viennese loved music, and they -- they -- they produced some of the finest writers in the world, a- the Germans did. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And these are the very same people who perfected the art of killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And nobody can tell me that people didn’t know about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">When you think about it, hundreds and thousands of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , it took architects, it took engineers, 1t took builders, carpenters, guards, railroad conductors, truck drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Millions of people were involved to commit this crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And nobody can tell me that people didn’t know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They should feel guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The new generation of Germans, I really think, is trying to overcome this. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">The Austrians have not learned quite as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And yet, I find it very disturbing that in an election not long ago in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , about 20 percent of the vote went to the Nazi movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And that’s bothersome. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">That’s something that we need to be concerned about. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I -- I’d like to -- I think this could be the end of my -- of the interview, unless you have something else that you want to ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I don’t know how we as a people can impart to others that there 1s so much good in the world, and yet there is so much evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And what is so important, that the good overcomes the evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Good people can become bad, and I always say, find the good people, find those and protect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But also, speak up when you hear bigots. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And what we have to remember, hatred is hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">If there is hatred against minorities because of their color, it’s the same as hatred because of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And we, as Jews, especially those of us who survived, have a responsibility, we have a duty, if nothing else, to speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Speak up and help others to overcome this. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">If there is nothing else we ve done, I think that that -- that has to be a mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So, we have not lost faith, we have not lost faith in people, and we have not lost in faith in our religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I feel very good with what I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And I’m very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And if my children or grandchildren, or great-grandchildren and my wife see this, I just want you know that I love you.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So there never was any cultural adjustment, or you were never ostracized, or --
