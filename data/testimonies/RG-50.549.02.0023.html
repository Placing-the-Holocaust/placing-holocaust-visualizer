<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I wonder if we can begin with you just stating your name and telling us whether or not you ever spelled it differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Stefan Czyzewski and I never spelled it differently, except for duration of 1941 to ‘45, I carried a different last name and I was a-at that time, I was Stefan Grot, G-r-o-t. And reason for change, that none of us in the -- in my fighting group carried his own name. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">In most cases, we just had one word pseudonym -- pseudoname. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">In my case, I carried a full name, but my last name was different from the original.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Before we get to your work in your fighting group in your resistance, during the war, I’ve heard that your father hid a Jewish family, or hid Jews and I wonder if you can tell us that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Yes, we -- my father hid a friend, whose name was Ithzac Visipka and his two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">One was about eight, one was about 11, a boy and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And the tragedy of my father’s life was that they were killed, very close to the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">During one of the pacifications, Mr. Visipka just couldn’t stand it, sitting in hiding, so he took off and ran and was caught in a <span class="DLF">field</span> -- in open <span class="DLF">field</span> by pacification squad, the German SS group and he was killed and his children were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And the bad part of it 1s, too, that they were shot only once and wer -- they were dying for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They refused to shoot them second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And of course, later on, they came and took my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Somebody apparently reported and my father, he had to dig a <span class="DLF">grave</span> for them and bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And they also were going to shoot my father -- father, with them, but my father was a foxy old man, so before he went there, he went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , he pulled ours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans gave him in the first World War, pinned it up on his jacket and dug the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">After he buried this -- I mean, after he laid these people in, he even put his jacket over their faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And they said, “Now it’s your turn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So he turned around and said, “Do you want to kill a German hero?” </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So they looked, and he had a -- his citation with him, in his pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They read the citation and said, “Old man, you escaped this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Don’t let that happen again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And they let him go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Can you tell us how your father came to hide them? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">What were the circumstances that led to this? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Did -- did they --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Was very -- very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Everybody -- just about everybody I knew was hiding a Jewish person or two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Just about everybody in our -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of 52 <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , we had probably 20 or 30 Jewish people being hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Some survived, some did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">One person that we hid, did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She was a young Jewish woman and she did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Later on she served in the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I don’t -- I know her name was Maria, but I don’t re -- know her -- never knew her last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She was a friend of Mr. Jebbe, who was a tailor, who was also with us for some time, but he was killed during one of the pacifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  So this hiding occurred in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshganorra</span> , your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshnagorra</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Do you know when it began, the hiding of th-the father and the two children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  It began in late 1941, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> were established. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Mr. Visipka’s wife decided not to go in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">She decided to go to the ghe -- stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and she even decided to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , where she perished, apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But Mr. Visipka did not want to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , since he was used to roaming the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Before the war, he carried bundle for his mother, Golda, who was a peddler and he knew everybody and everybody knew Mr. Visipka. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So he thought that he would survive among the Polish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Do you know if he came to your father and asked him, or if your father offered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I don’t think he ever asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He came one night and father -- he -- we talk and he -- father and he talked and father found him a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and when I came back from the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> , in fall of 1941, I made Mr. Visipka a good <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And he stayed there forever and a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  So you made the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">How did you do it, tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  There was an big <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , huge, huge <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> above the <span class="BUILDING">cow barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was full of straw, bundles of straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, I made a little trap door in a <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and I made a <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> <span class="DLF">trap door</span> in a ceiling of the barn and I made a chamber among the straw above that <span class="DLF">trap door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was nice and warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was stinky, of course, but who cared about stink at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And Mr. Visipka stayed there, on and off. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He would go places. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He -- we would go to work in a <span class="DLF">field</span> for some of the farmers who had so-called <span class="DLF">farms</span> on outskirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He could not work on our <span class="DLF">farm</span> , because our <span class="DLF">farm</span> was within a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and too many people would have seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So he went to work for people who -- who were all alone somewhere on the side of -- on the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he would stay and work with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Then they will come back, he will get -- bring some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And of course, food was never short in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so he didn’t have to worry about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Were you there when he was discovered and killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I was with my fighting unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I heard story after I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My father wouldn’t talk, but some people talked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  You father wouldn’t talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He felt very bad about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And we had a -- we had all kind of moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Funny moments, laughing moments, was horribly scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We were worrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There was one moment -- we were notified by somebody who knew about the pacification squad coming in, so we told Mr. Visipka, “Get in and stay there and don’t peek out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Well, Mr. Visipka left his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He couldn’t stand it, he ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Later on he said, “I didn’t want to be found and have all of you killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So he came back next -- next day, wet, muddy, cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And he said, “No panyan. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I had three lucks. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The first luck was the German didn’t kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The second luck wa -- luck was, your dog didn’t eat me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We had a big, big dog. “</span><span class="sentence" id="82">And the third luck was, I didn’t drown in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , just about 200 feet from our <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He said, “The third -- third luck was, I did not drown in the mud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  An-and -- and the woman, Maria, who stayed with you, was she staying at the same time and where was she staying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  She was staying just about the same time and even before and after. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">She did not stay with us permanently, but she would come and stay for a week or two and then she would go her own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We didn’t want to know where she went and she didn’t want to tell us where she went. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She apparently had many <span class="NPIP">places</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And after the war, she worked for the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Minz, in the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And she was twice, I think, instrumental in saving my father from the Communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  What do you -- what do you know about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Can you tell us anything about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I didn’t know very much, because I wasn’t there, but later on my sister brought me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They wanted my father to join the collective and he said, “Damn you, forget it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So, they had a local Communist who was forcing and encouraging everybody to join the collective, give the <span class="DLF">farm</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So my father went and threaten him, so they ha-had him arrested and beat him up and of course, Maria came and saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And a couple weeks later, somebody went out at night and shot up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the person who was forcing everybody into it, and I know who that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My father was a [indecipherable] was short-tempered. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He has a gun, he had a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He could do almost anything, within reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Your father did that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Of course, he was arrested immediately after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But he was released and the police -- for their pains, the local militia almost got executed by the Soviet general.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Why did they almost get executed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Well, during the war, there was a dirty old -- dirty old, well, he was -- looked old, he was in his probably late 20’s or early 30’s -- Russian hiding with us for man -- I mean, for weeks and months, at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And my father spoke Russian very well, because he served in south imperial army, and they became friends, and that Ivan, as we called him, came and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">After the war, we discovered that he led all the Communist partisans in our <span class="REGION">territory</span> and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge of an Russian pantzer division in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , which was about 10 - 15 miles from our <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, when my father was arrested second time, my sister went and tried to talk to the man in charge in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And of course, they wouldn’t let her talk to him, but eventually she prevailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She just sat down and wouldn’t move and talked to Ivan Ivanovitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I don’t know if it was his real name or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He came storming in, in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army car</span> with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">county village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He took the police, put them against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and ta -- got my father out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and said, “Yanna, do you want to shoot those son of a bitches?” </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And father said, “Oh, no, they do their work. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But they beat me up, so I want to hit them few times.” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So, he hit them few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And they were warned, they were told, “If you ever happen -- anything happens to John ever, I’1l come and shoot you, you [indecipherable] and so and so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  So there was a lot going on at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Well, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We had a lively life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  I-It was -- it seems that it was a safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for at least two Jewish families -- well, one family, one woman, and then a Communist partisan, who happened to turn out to be an important leader?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Of course, there were other people who came in and out, hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">People from the Polish underground, some of my boys who were hurt, who were shot, stayed for a few days, couple weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">As you -- as I mentioned previously, I think my mother - my mother, my grandmother, was a witch doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">She had weeds, she -- she -- she had herbs, she had all kind of stuff and she could cure almost anybody out of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">She couldn’t grow legs or arms, but she could do almost anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So we had many wounded partisans come and stay and hide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  So, if something happened in your fighting group and someone was injured, you would e -- you might take them to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or tell them how to get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Yes, we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  And then where would they actually stay, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Oh, we had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , we had a kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">storeroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Course we had a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> with all kind of hid-hid-hiding places, they could stay there, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  And the word never got around that this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Czyzewski’s was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="BUILDING">Czyzewski’s</span> was a house where there were many partisans in and out and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, the wor --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Jews hiding and --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- the words got around and we had many visits from the Schultz Politsi, even people from the Einsatzgruppen came to visit few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They beat my father, occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But never shot -- never killed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Did your father or your sisters ever talk about feeling afraid during this times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Yes, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They were shitty scared at times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  How did they tell you that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Oh yes, we’re afraid, we shook. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We cried, we yelled a lot wh-when they hit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So they just left us alone and went away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Your sisters were hit, also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  My sisters were hit also, especially my younger sister, who would te -- who would - who was outspoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  I'd like to turn now, to fill in some <span class="DLF">gaps</span> , turn now to your training as a -- as an underground fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I’m talking about the period -- the six month period where you left <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and then you walked in to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I’m wondering if we could talk a little bit about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">What did the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> actually look like when you finally got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  It was a tent city, close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teheran</span> , out in the <span class="DLF">desert</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> , close to Teheran, out in the desert. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">There was cold at night, there was hot during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The hamsen blew occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The sto -- sandstorm blew occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And the British fished out a small group of people and since my whole life practically went by seventeens, there were 17 young Polish boys and there was a British -- Commander Thompson, we called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He went -- he ran the guts out of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We went on long marches, with heavy loads. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We went infiltrate and exfiltrating from objects -- military objects -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  What do you mean by that, infiltrating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Sneaking in and sneaking out, without being caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  For instance, how would he have you do that, in a training exercise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  We would burrow under the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had wi -- barbed wire round. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We would get in, we would steal things to te -- to s -- to tell that we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the camp guards, who had put an especial -- they were receive special efforts that somebody 1s going to infiltrate here and we were caught couple times, but we were caught about twi- two out of 10 times. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Most of the time we were lucky to get in and get out without being caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  So you would be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you would have a mission to sneak in, steal something and sneak back out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And at times we just went in carrying nothing and times we came -- we went in carrying arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">At times we went in carrying heavy loads, in preparation for later times, when we had to carry explosives, things. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And we went on long marches, we went on a -- we took in a -- took part in a firefights. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We took part in firefights being surrounded by superior forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And that really helped us later on, when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  What -- what strategies were you learning in those exercises? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">What do you do when you’re surrounded by superior forces?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  You divide your group in two or three subgroups. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And one groups opens heavy fire when the -- the other group proceeds ahead of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Then this -- then the group that went ahead of you opens heavy fire and you catch up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And then in -- both of you open heavy fire in every direction when the third lit -- group comes to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And for a time we made efforts not to get surrounded by the Einsatzgruppen that we went to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Later on, when we -- when we received our good armament, especially after we bought whole lot of -- after we bought a whole lot of Schmizers from a German supply officers, were so heavily armed, that the Germans had no chance with us, whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">As I mentioned in my previous interview, the 75 to 120 people in a German Einsatzgruppen would have four automatic weapons and rest would be manual rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">My group of 17 plus two, carried 27 Schmizers, because 10 of my boys did not trust the damn German weapon, they wanted to have two. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So, we had a su-surplus of it, so each of them carried two. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we had such a enormous firepower that he, on purpose wanted to be surrounded so we could get into fire -- a real firefight and get out of it and well, knock out more people than we normally would have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  In the training sessions though, what kind of ammunition were you firing? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Was it live or blank?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  We always used live ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Work it -- were -- were wounded sometime, but it was realistic, we always used live ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">If you stuck your neck -- head too far, you got hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So you don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You keep your head down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Did anyone ever get killed in training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I’m -- I don’t want to talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  You mentioned that when you first got there, there was a period of indoctrination, psychological or philosophical. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">What -- what -- what were you learning in that period -</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span> , when you were being indoctrinated to become an underground fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">What was the philosophy that you were being taught?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Well the -- first of all, the British wanted to re-brainwash us after we had been brainwashed by the Communists, which didn’t take very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And later on, we had British and we had <span class="BUILDING">Polish office</span> -- political officers coming and talking to us, invoking great Polish patriotism, which was unnecessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We were too patriotic as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">As a matter of fact, we were chauvinistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But mostly it was the philosophy of hitting back, philosophy of saving people. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Philosophy of making the Europe free of the Nazi scourge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  And was there any talk in this indoctrination period of what -- of what else you were fighting for? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">What was the end goal in terms of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  The end goal of -- was a free -- or free <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Independent, free <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It turned otherwise, but we really wanted to fight for the free, independent <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  And wa -- was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">training camp</span> allied with any of the underground movements? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">In other words, you were training in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Were they telling you, we want you to connect, when you get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , with one of these specific underground armies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  It was suggested, but it was not told to. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">When we came back, the most powerful group was the ZWZ and we joined it for a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Then, that was evolving into the home army, the AK. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And also in the NSZ, the nationals armed forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So some of us -- some of us were given groups of fighters from either AK or NSZ and in my case, my sympathies were with -- were with NSZ and they gave me -- supplied me with some ammunitions, some arms, some explosives and gave me 17 people, plus two. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">That was that ti --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You were going to say, I think you were saying it was a right wing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  It was a right wing Polish underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  And I want to talk more about that, but I just want to get clear on one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">When you say that it was suggested that you make a connection to a certain group, what -- what were your leaders in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British training camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Which group were they guiding you towards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  The -- not the British, but the Polish political officers were guiding us toward the present and the future home army, because the home army was under jurisdiction of the Polish government in exile in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  And how would they suggest? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">What would they say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Well, they would -- they would talk a lot about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">This is probably the best middle of the way group. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They don’t discriminate against anybody and they don’t fight -- fight any other group, they even tolerate the Socialist, Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And this is probably the future of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we will have to live with that, Soviet Russia. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And this probab -- this government probably will be the most likely to survive and continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And we were told -- also told -- we were warned against my future, NSZ, those people have no future because the Soviet Russia will never allow it -- them to exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But, of course, if you are 17 and 18, you don’t believe it, you are omnipotent. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Muse-Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski and this is tape number one, side B. If you could just tell us a little bit more about your personal allegiance to the underground group that -- that you chose, the NSZ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  They just happens -- happened almost by happenstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They were in ma -- ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I was available, they were receptive. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The AK, the army akaioba already had a group like mine from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They took one of my friends who came with me, as a leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And the NSZ people had better armament that they could provide us with and also they were very much against the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They hated the damn Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And of course, after spe -- having spent a year in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soviet prison camp</span> , I didn’t like them much either. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So, that was probably kind of a combination of reasons why I did join the NSZ.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  And as you’ve described and y-y-you described them sometimes as right wing and in fact, in some cases, they were known for being very anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">What were your thoughts about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  That was probably the only aspect that I didn’t cherish. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Also, in my very <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , in my very group, we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">As I previously mentioned, I had two people in my group who survived the whole schmier. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Out of the four, who are left out of the 20, two of them were Jewish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Isaac One and Isaac Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And we had -- I have known another probably half a dozen Jewish young men who were in a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Some even were in a command. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So even though the NSZ was at times quite anti- Semitic, everybody had a Jew he liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And he wou -- whom he would protect and save and wanted him to come and fight with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Tell us, how did the group express it’s anti-Semitism, if in fact, sometimes Jews were in the group? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">How was it expressed, the anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  In most cases -- in my group, we never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We -- our talk was always how to hit the da-damn -- damn Germans and hora and whit and how to be most effective. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And my two Jewish boys had con -- had connection with people in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> - in neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> 1n two or three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and had some conva -- kind of a uncanny ability or foresight. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">If we wanted sometime to go one way, they would -- one of them would say, “Walcheem, no we don’t want to go that way, we want to go around.” </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So we went around and we discovered later on if we went that way, we would have gotten knocked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So it was more on a personal level than on a ideological level. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They trusted you, you trusted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And sometime you trusted them more than you tru-trusted your -- your -- your own Polack in your group. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was mostly personal and we hardly ever talked ideology during our fights, during our existence -- throughout our existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  I want to go back a little bit, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">training camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You have told us about how you learned how to infiltrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">How did you learn how to -- for instance, to do certain acts of sabotage, how did you practice them? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Perhaps derailing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , if you could explain to us how they gave you that training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  The sabotage part of it was probably the most extens-extensive and took the longest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They taught us techniques -- how to use old dynamite, which was the only explosive that we could fi -- get in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And how to build that plate -- carry and put metal plate on the -- under the explosives, under the rail. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They taught us, if they -- we did not have explosives, they tol -- they trained us how to loosen up a rail to detrain a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But in most cases, the most effective would have been explosives. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They told us how to use batteries and since we did not have good equipment, we -- you just hung up to two little wires in your hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Your hand shook and you wondered if y -- if you are going to blow the damn thing on time or after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went by, which sometime it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">My commander was mad at me at ev -- every time I missed that thing, he wanted to court martial and we -- he threatened to put me against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and shoot me if I missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But of course, later on he told me, “I would never shoot you, because you are useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">You are a good tool.” </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Well, I don’t know if I was a good tool or not, but I tried my darnest. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They told us how to attach explosive to <span class="DLF">doors</span> or to <span class="DLF">gates</span> or to the <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">How to remove a brick from a <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> , surrounding an object or how to dig out quickly, break out of a <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> and put explosives in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And how to stretch the wire, how to use -- how to use fuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">How long each fuse would burn -- how many feet per minute it would burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">How many meters per a minute it would burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">How far you had to be from an objective if you blow it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Which side of the object you were blowing up, you were supposed to be on, if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">If it’s not possible, how to hide, what to hide 1n, how to best hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The best pla -- best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide was to dig a <span class="DLF">foxhole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You didn’t have time to dig the <span class="DLF">foxhole</span> , so you hi -- you were kind of in a halfway quandary and great excitement and being scared and being perplexed. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And strange enough, I can’t believe it, but most of the times, perhaps seven out of 10, maybe eight, sometime nine out of 10, we were lucky and effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Were you often, when you did go through with an action and blow something up, were you often within hearing distance of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  We were always within hearing distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Sometime we were within -- within a harm distance of it, except that if you put yourself behind a big stone or in a small <span class="DLF">ditch</span> or behind another <span class="DLF">wall</span> , you were not harmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But sometime you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I had bricks -- <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> fall on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The object was probably 200 feet from where I was, that blown up and I was hiding behind a good <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> that turned out not to be a great <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> , because if fell apart and I got knocked out, practically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  You had said in your prior interview that the Polish and the British commanders chose you the best of the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">When they said you were ready, was it clear -- what did they tell you and were they putting you, Stefan Czyzewski up as a commander that when you got into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you would command a unit, was that clear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  That was clear, but I don’t think I mentioned it to [indecipherable] of the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Those 17 of us, all of us were the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we ca -- we were sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with an understanding that when we reached there, we are the only people who are trained and we automatically would assume command of small wet works groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  That is what I meant --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  -- that the group was the best of the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  The groups a -- wa -- the -- was the best of the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  So that you were, in essence, an elite group who had had more training than most, so that you could go back and then lead 17 other, smaller groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Yes, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Yes, we -- we -- later on we did train some people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , back in, especially after some of us got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We didn’t want to run out of people who knew enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But resources were skimpy. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The <span class="REGION">territory</span> was not always safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So we had a difficult time training more people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the system that the British developed for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  Now, I know you’ve told us the story of how you got back into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and your crossing water, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Did you have ins -- what were your instructions once you got into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Where were you supposed to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">How were you supposed to know where to be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  We were told to disperse and since we -- individuals who are from a different part of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were told they -- to go into your own <span class="REGION">territory</span> where you know people, where people know you. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Perhaps close to where your family is and search out underground groups and join them and tell them who you are and what you can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  So tell us how you did that when you got back near to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leshnagorra</span> , your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , how did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Yes, I came to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , I joined my family, I stayed with them and my friends from the original -- original group, the OP, the defenders of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was already incorporate into ZWZ, appro -- came to talk to me within probably two days after I came back and say, “Hey, [indecipherable] want to rejoin?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="323">Well, tell me who and horah.” </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So we had a few meetings with local people and then we went to meetings with the so-called overall command and we identified -- I mean, I was the only one, I identified myself and told them what I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And if they had any -- had a job for me, all right, if not I will find somebody to join me. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And of course, they accepted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I went through interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They, at that beginning did not trust me, but eventually we developed affinity. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And after I told them what I went through and identified <span class="NPIP">places</span> <span class="NPIP">places where</span> I was and the training I went through, then they tested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They gave me -- I joined a small fighting group who went on a few jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I became an advisor to the young man who ran -- who led that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And about -- within -- probably within two months, they gave me my own group and I became completely independent from everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I had supervision. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I had a commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> to whom I reported and who collected information on what we did and who would provide us with <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And that was on and on and on and on, until 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  What was your attitude when you first got back? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You had all this training. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Were you very eager to get going right away and for people to recognize that you knew how to do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">What was your attitude about the process of being accepted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Well, first of all, I was cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I didn’t know who was who and who might be working for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">After I discovered that nobody was working for the Germans, except those who openly were Bolstoitch people, a supervisor or those who ran the <span class="REGION">county</span> or those who collected taxes and those who collected food and items for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Then I was eager to join whoever I could, to join to go and fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I wanted to -- I mean, I was bragging about no end, I told 10 times more than I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I never unlearned to exaggerate. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I still don’t know how not to exaggerate. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So what I say, sometime, you should take with a big handful of salt, because 1t may be exaggeration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit about actually being back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Wasn’t it unusual for a -- a young Polish man to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In other words, wasn’t it suspicious that you had been away and wouldn’t that call attention to you, possibly as being an underground person? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I’m wondering if you can explain the atmosphere to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Could you, as a young Polish man, just walk around normally, or did it -- that raise questions for the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Well, th-they --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And make you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- they did not -- the Germans did not have a close supervision over a <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Ours was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , as I mentioned previously, 52 <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , built along the -- one long <span class="DLF">street</span> and everybody knew everybody and most of the people were very patriotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">There were some people there who were members of the home army. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">There were some people who were members -- I mean, young boy -- young men who are members of the NSZ. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We’ve only had two people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , one from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and one from a distant <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , who were members of the AL, the Communist partisan underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Two, a whole two out of about 25,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  So did you carry false documents? </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Did you have some sort of cover of what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  No, at that time -- at that time, I did not carry false documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Before I came -- before I came, every Polish person would receive a so-called cancarity -- a document with your picture on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You live here, you a farmer, you are this, you are that and if you wa -- if you go anyplace, you had to carry this with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So when I came back, a friendly person in an administration, made the cancarta for me with a pre-date, so I was just somebody who was here all the time, never left, never was any quar -- just a young peasant, living in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Not exactly illiterate, but not exactly bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And one who brags a lot and one who likes girls and goes to dances and go places and works hard on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And of course, shortly after that, somebody apparently was reporting and the German police would come and look for me and of course, they never -- I was never in and they kept coming and pushing my father around. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He said, “When you came first time here, he got scared of you so badly, he just ran away, never showed up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I don’t know where he is.” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So they would beat up my father slightly, not badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I mean, they didn’t break his bones, but they would make him black and blue and let be at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And that was the duration. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I would come for a visit occasionally, talk to my father and he would say a few things and he said, “Okay, you can go back, give them <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="375">That was -- kind of a -- became everyday life. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Like a life ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> became everyday life -- normal everyday life, that also became normal, everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  Did you have a small bag of things that you always carried with you, since you were on the move so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Yes, I had a backpack. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I carried my stuff with me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  One pair of underwear, one pair of socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And of course I had my Schmizer with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I also had a good American six shooter. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I cherished it, because it was so dependable. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">In a short encount -- in a -- in a close encounter, that was the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  Do you remember the make of the gun? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The six shooter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  Actually, it was a ru -- it was a Russian nagant, n-a-g-a-n-t, but it was built like an American western six shooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  So you had a German weapon and a Russian weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Russian weapon, I had the Russian nagant, and Russian nagant, you could bury it in the mud, pull it out and it would not malfunction.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Do you want to tell us about that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Yes, it were -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you were not -- before you got to know what was really going on, you felt almost a relief, because my interrogation after arrest, was very intensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was badly mistreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">My last few weeks in Polish underground were very intense [indecipherable] very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So, first coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and getting shaved and getting washed and given a uniform and being little chased around, occasionally hit, but not badly, did not feel too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Eventually, you learned how horrible it was, but it was later -- later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The first impression was, was not exactly summer camp and a bet -- but better than <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , because you did not sleep, 17 of you, in a two person cell, as I did in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> and a bet -- but better than prison, because you did not sleep, 17 of you, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">two person cell</span> , as I did in a prison before, during my interrogation and after my sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So, first 1t was almost a relief that you were in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you could almost survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Later on you learned otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  What was so intense and difficult about the last few weeks of your underground time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  We were very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We did get into several firefights. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We blew up few objects that mis-blew, either blew in our direction or else were mishandled. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I was called on the carpet couple of times and threatened with execution, because you messed up the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Combination of all of it can get you down, occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Even the -- I was not as rambunctious as I always was, during last few weeks.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  Well, they were -- they were worrying about their relatives -- friends and relatives back in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">They were worrying what they are going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">They were worrying if they were maybe -- if they may be forced to repatriate back to Communist <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">They were discussing possibilities of emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">At that time, all in 1945, six, even seven, nobody dreamed that he -- they would be able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was kind of a seventh heaven somewhere way up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Nobody thought they would ever be able to reach it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So, many people started emigrating in 1948, to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , to work in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">To <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> to work in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Later on, when emigration became available to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , many people -- many, many people went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Then eventually, U.S. legislation passed a special bill that allowed the refugees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Displaced Person camp</span> to come here outside of the quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They still ha-had kind ofa quota and people from certain <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had easier time coming here than from others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And the Polish people especially, were given certain preference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">So, a lot of Polish Jewish people were coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and a lot of Poles were coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And a lot of Russian, Ukrainian and White Russian people, falsify a doc -- their documents as if they were Polish citizens, and also came in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">So the conversations, a lot of it was, “Can I go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Can I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Oh, can I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">But everybody wanted to come to the seventh heaven, which was <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  Were you -- who else was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">The way you just described it, 1t sounds like there were other Poles? </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But who -- who made up the camp population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashafenberg camp</span> was a mixture of White Russians, few Russians, some Ukrainians and Poles, but Poles constituted about 90 percent of the population in -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashafenberg camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">The other two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashafenberg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Displaced Person camps</span> , one was strictly Ukrainian and one was strictly Russian and -- and White Russian.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">QUESTION:  Now, when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashafenberg</span> , it was ‘46, °47, until early ‘48. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">This is a pretty long time after the war has ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">How -- what were people’s feelings about that; that they had been li-living in Displaced Person’s camps for so long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">ANSWER:  Well, they didn’t have chance to get jobs in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">There was hunger, privation and no jobs to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Also, we were not allowed to apply for civilian jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So they were kind of kept caged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">If you wanted to go out, you had to have a permission -- written permission to go out, with a hope of emigrating somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Some Russian and some White Russian people were forced to repatriate to their respective <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And of course, we heard later on that all of them were dr -- went directly to si -- to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And Polish people, Czech people, Hungarian and Romanians and the <span class="REGION">Baltic countries</span> , people were not forced to repatriate, so they just waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Sit -- sat, vegetated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Developed bad habits like not working, or drinking and waiting for the <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> to open somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And eventually, most of us emigrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Most of us came to United States, a lot went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , a lot went to Canada and Australia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Some to <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , some to the low countries to get the most menial jobs that nobody else wanted to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I had a friend who was a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> operator in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken camp</span> and when his half a day a week assignment came, he never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Or else he would pay somebody to go and do his shoveling or splitting the wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Eventually, he was called to a camp administrator who was -- who was American -- who was American lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And he was questioned and said mer -- she said, “Mr. So and so, I heard that you have not gone last week and this week to -- to your assigned work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">What is the matter with you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And he said, “Lady, that’s a lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">They are schmearing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I have never went to wor -- begun to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I have never yet did any work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">I pay people to work for me.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Well, how can you afford it?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Well, see, I’m great black market operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And I’m lucky because I never get caught.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So that wa -- she laughed and she let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">By the way, the administrator of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken camp</span> was Miss Catherine Hulme, H-u-l-m-e. And there is a beautiful book written by her about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">It was called, “The Wild Place.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">It was published in 1950’s and I had had a copy and I loaned it to somebody, never got it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Has been out of print since about 1960’s and I can presume that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> might have a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">If they don’t, they should really search for it and find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">She was a good writer, especially when she wrote about Mrs. Captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">There was a tough underground captain, lady from Polish underground army, who ran a <span class="DLF">block</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> -- probably couple hundred former prostitutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">She put them all on a -- on a s-straight and narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">None of them ever did any trade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> when -- when the Mrs. Captain was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">She was just like a god, like a <span class="DLF">block</span> as -- altester in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Watch out, don’t cross Mrs. Captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">She was an old lady, she was big, she was bowlegged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">She -- when they had a parade, she would walk ahead of her troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">She was a --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Her troops of former prostitutes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1146">ANSWER:  No, sh-she ran the group -- I mean, she supervised a group of former prostitutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1147">QUESTION:  Yeah, okay, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">But tho-those were her troops, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">ANSWER:  Those were her troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">QUESTION:  Okay, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  She had trained them, she had uniformed them and she d-dared them, “Any of you to play your trade, you are going to be brained.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And when they marched down the s -- down the <span class="DLF">street</span> in a parade, you could -- I mean, you could just hold your stomach and laugh because she was kind of biggish and she had very bowlegged legs and she had the army boots on and she had very short army skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">She was a sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">QUESTION:  Why do you think the author, the -- the former director of the camp called it the wild <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> means the wild <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">ANSWER:  Yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> is the wild <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">QUESTION:  Were there moments of real lightheartedness in the dis -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  Nine out of 10 hours were lighthearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Everybody was drunk with freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Everybody was completely intoxicated with freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">When you thought back what was there before and what was then, it was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And when we talked or when I reflected occasionally, I saw myself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusensfie</span> , getting off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and walking under the <span class="DLF">viaduct</span> to the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , to dig and work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And over the <span class="DLF">viaduct</span> , passing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would be going on and people standing in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , leaning out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , eating and drinking and billing -- being free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And saw those beautiful German, blonde girls leaning out and looking on them and you heart was so sick looking at that freedom those people had and looking at yourself, that you were going- may be killed today or tomorrow or starve to death or drowned tonight by a capo or ha -- you head to -- was -- to -- bashed in that night by another capo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">So then frequently, when you later on thought about this and about what was then, after liberation, you just were completely intoxicated with that freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">QUESTION:  Were people talking about what had happened to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Is that something that people had a need to go into detail about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  A lot of people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Lot of people shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Some people couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And many of us were quite abnormal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">We hoarded food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">We picked up every scrap of everything on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Even now, when I walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I see a penny, or a piece of paper, or an old shoelace, I pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">We just hoarded everything, because well, you never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Maybe tomorrow you are going to be hungry or maybe I want to tie my shoes and I wouldn’t have anything to tie them with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And most of us kind of outgrew it and adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">At least, I hope I adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I have some strange custom and habits and thoughts occasionally, but I don’t rave and don’t -- well, don’t seem to be abnormal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I had a wife who lives with me forever and she somehow stands me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But many of us became quite abnormal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I think I mentioned previously a father of a young girl I met here, who came to talk to me about the life there and I discover later on that he was a Jewish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And I told her that she should ask him to tell her what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">He survived the whole war in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Polish forest</span> with a group of partisans, or by -- and by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">He does not want to talk about it, not a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">He doesn’t want to talk, so I ask her to wor -- “Well, ask him to write it down.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1189">He doesn’t know how to write.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Well, ask him to write in Polish.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1191">He doesn’t know how to write in Polish.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Well, how about Yiddish?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1193">He doesn’t know how to write it Yiddish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">He’s completely illiterate and he doesn’t want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">After all that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">QUESTION:  Can you tell us when and how you be -- you -- you became a stenographer for the police and I believe this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1197">ANSWER:  Yes, I took a st-steno course in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashafenberg</span> just before I left and just before I left, I applied for a steno job with the police or the <span class="BUILDING">camp administrator office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And my best friend, Captain Psheckfass, who was a police commander there, he negated my application. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Then, when we were transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you know why he did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1200">ANSWER:  He thought I was too foxy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">He knew a little about my document washing, or else he had heard a rumor about my document washing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">He was afraid if I have access to documents, especially to the copies -- I mean, to the f -- blanks of documents, I may sneak some out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">By -- when I -- when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> , he tried to do the same thing, but he was overruled by Captain Jaigiss, who was a liaison officer with the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And Mr. Jaigiss made he -- me his personal stenographer and he put me into the investigation -- into <span class="BUILDING">crime office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Made me into a great detective, which I wasn’t.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1466">ANSWER:  They were SS guards, they were co -- gareekt -- court judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">You know, they had Na-Nazis appoin-appointed volk gareekt judges -- anybody, picked them up to -- to give death sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Anybody who comes, death sentence, death sentence or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">They were just local, rabid Nazis who judged people for almost anything, any little trespass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">If you were foreign worker, you -- they would sent you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or have you hunged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">If you went to -- slept -- if a German woman encouraged young Polish or Russian boy to sleep with her, it was found out, death sentence immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">Took him out and hunged him on the nearest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">But it had to be cour-court case in a gareekt loytemp people -- people would mete out death sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">So, many of those were apprehended and information on them collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">And some of them were de-Nazified, th-they were interrogated and found that they were not really great perpetrators, they were just mitlowfers or kind of helpers uppers, but not really criminals, and let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">And all of them were glad to stay in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">But some were sent to <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> , went through court system.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1478">QUESTION:  And tell us a little bit about the experience of sitting across from some of these people who were SS guards or -- or judges, who’d had a part in the violence and oppression that you experienced, what was it like to sit across from them and ask them questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1479">ANSWER:  Well you -- you tried to question this person as a person, but you felt about him like a vermin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">In my case, I knew what happened -- what was done to me by mine interrogator and two or three of his henchmen, who beat the biyesus out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">And you -- you could see that those people might have done, so you question them and question them and question them and if there were any witnesses, you questioned the witnesses and you confronted them with the witnesses and you felt like bashing their heads in, but of course, you were not allowed to touch them, so you kept them for 18 hours talking and you give them a lot to drink and, “I want to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">You go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> when I tell you to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">It didn’t feel so great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">You didn’t feel good humiliating them, but you felt like doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">You felt like that was your duty to -- to really find out if he is innocent or if he really was guilty and if turned out that he really couldn’t prove anything against him, that you felt bad because you mistreated the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">You made him wet his pants many times when he sat in the front of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1488">QUESTION:  Was it something that you wanted to continue doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1489">ANSWER:  An -- I did not want to do it again, ever, in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">But at that time, I was interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">I wanted to do it and mainly I wanted to help, to weed out those who were real henchmen, murderers, criminals, who would -- who should not be fr -- walking free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">But, of course, the sentences they received were just nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Four years, five years, 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">He would serve 12 months and would be released in a good behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">It was just -- I mean, it was almost -- almost a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">But, we thought, well, at least something, at least -- at least something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">There’s going -- going to be a black mark on his documents and he would not be allowed to perform within the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">For instance, getting -- be-becoming important person, or -- or getting a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">Every one of them got a good job later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">They helped one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">One did get in, he pulled all 10 of them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">There were a lot of German police in the German army -- West German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">There were a lot in -- in -- in -- in intelligence, a lot of former perpetrators were with Gellen in -- outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , helping Americans against the Soviets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1505">QUESTION:  How did this affect or shape your idea of justice after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1506">ANSWER:  I was quite skeptical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">First I thought we are performing great service and kind of making them pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">Later on, it became a big joke and you became skeptical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">But things of the world are as they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">It is next to impossible to punish somebody for crimes -- cruelty, or else whatever they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">It was next impossible of punishing them, except sending them to the holy inquisition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Putting them in a wheel to stretch their arms, break their joints and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">And of course, nobody was allowed to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">There was one American, Captain Bollack, he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hammtrack</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">He would get occasionally short tempered and he would hit wildly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">But after one or two times, I didn’t want to be with him any more and when he -- when I interrogated somebody, I ask him, “Please, Captain Bollack, don’t come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">Because he would hit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1518">QUESTION:  Was -- how did you come to a decision that you didn’t want to hit? </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">Because certainly, in your first interview, you told the story about coming across your German interrogator, and you could have hit him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1520">ANSWER:  I could have, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">QUESTION:  Ho-How did you come to that decision, if you could talk a bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1522">ANSWER:  Well, I cou -- looked at him -- him, I looked at myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">He was a big, strong man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">I was a little, tiny sprout. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">And him mistreated me as he -- as he did, I said, “Do -- Do I want to be like you were? </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">I don’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">So, when I questioned him, he said, “Well, I was doing my job.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1528">Did you have to do what you did to me?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1529">Well, I was doing my job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">So, he say, “If you have to do your job, you can do it to me anything you want to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">Yeah, he was quite resigned by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1532">QUESTION:  This was Hans Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">ANSWER:  Yes, Hans Christian [indecipherable] name Mr. Meyer, or whatever he called himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">I don’t even know if his na -- real name was Hans Christian, but I did find his transcript of his Ph.D. degree at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Heidelberg University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">He had a Ph.D. in criminal justice and Ph.D. in Christian theology.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1536">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">So how long did you do the work for the counterintelligence corps?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1538">ANSWER:  From 1940 -- early ‘48 through 1949, until I left in September for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">About - almost two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">Maybe little less than two years, maybe a little more then two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1541">QUESTION:  I want to ask you something about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and people’s sexual behavior, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">You had mentioned the -- the former prostitutes, but that they were under control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1543">ANSWER:  Oh, were they ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1544">QUESTION:  And then you mentioned that people were living together and then you mentioned the fathers abusing the daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And I guess what I’d like you to talk a little bit about 1s, what was the atmosphere generally? </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">People’s sexual behavior in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1547">ANSWER:  It wasn’t any worse than it was in a -- in normal, general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">At the beginning maybe it was little worse, because there were a lot of young, unattached people who paired on and paired off, but the influence of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> was very strong in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">There were priests, there were <span class="BUILDING">chapels</span> , there were <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">And people went to Confession, people went to Communion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">People went to Mass. Hardly anybody ever missed a Mass, except some hooligans who thought the -- there was few concentration -- former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates who lost belief in God, because they said, “If something like this happened, God does not exist.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">But very, very few, so it wasn’t much worse than anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">And, since li -- people lived in such a close proximity, you know, five, six, seven, well, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I was in was smaller than this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , there were five of us living in 1t. Some-Sometime 11 people lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of this size. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">Everybody knew everything about everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">So, if something happens, well, watch out, you get deported and a priest would come to talk to you and say, “You inferial so and so, you better not do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">Well, some people lived together and it was -- that was kind of almost semi-accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">They are lonely, they have nobody else, they have somebody to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">And many people who were supposed to be leaders or else people to give good example, or people to enforce the proper behavior, did not behave properly themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">Like my immediate superior of a investigation department, a judge Clem Camage, he lived with a pretty, young girl and they had a baby and he was so damn proud of that baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">This is tape number four, side A. Did you live with anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1563">ANSWER:  I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">Sorry to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">I was extremely fond of many girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">I fell in love with a French doctor -- lady doctor, who was my doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">Beautiful, young girl who just got out of <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">She volunteered to go and she was in <span class="BUILDING">Forheim sanitorium</span> , she was my doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">We became very friendly, she -- we went on a trip, she me -- requisitioned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">We went to see her family, stayed for a week, 10 days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Versailles</span> , outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , saw the sights, came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">When I went to a different <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> , well, she came to see me a few times, but nothing developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">All my childhood, I always was very fond of girls, just extremely fond of girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">I always had three steady ones and maybe two extra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">After the war, I was, for a long -- some time, very friendly with a Russian girl, then I was quite friendly with the Italian girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">Then, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> , a lady secretary in the next <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , said, “Banya Stefanya, why don’t you come and visit us?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1577">Well, P’Il be glad to visit you, but why should I come and visit you?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1578">Well, I have a beautiful daughter.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1579">Oh, when do I come?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">So, of course it was -- it -- Good Friday came and she said, “Well, why don’t you come tomorrow”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">Have a light lunch after work, we leave at noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And so we can go to visit the -- the <span class="DLF">tomb</span> ,” you know, we’re going into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and -- and praying in the front of the effigy of -- of Christ. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1583">We can have lunch and you -- you and Hanka can -- Hanka can go and visit the <span class="INT_SPACE">tombs</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">So I went and visit the -- I had a li-light lunch and I went with Hanka to -- to visit the ...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I guess -- I want to ask this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">I -- I’ve read about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and in some cases, people are really just sitting and waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">However, speaking to you, you are so engaged with your life, the immediate life that’s around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">You’re working and you're -- you’re being promoted from a stenographer to a detective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">How did you feel at that time about your life and what -- what was ma -- what you were maybe going to end up doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1589">ANSWER:  I felt very lucky to be able what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">And apparently, people who -- people who helped me apparently thought that I was worth a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">Also, it will probably seem pathetic, because those two people who helped me the most, spent time in a concentration camp also, or else a prisoner’s of war camp and those two people, Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski, who was a camp commander -- police commander in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashafenberg</span> and also worked in a policer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> also, or else a prisoner’s of war camp and those two people, Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski, who was a camp commander -- police commander in Ashafenberg and also worked in a policer in Wildeflecken, was very sympathetic and very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">Later on, when I got to know Lieutenant Penjik, he also helped me survive in the -- in the police department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">He was one of the dignitaries there who did not very much, but was a very elegant person, a well-spoken person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">The drinkit -- drinkest person I ever met and we were very close friends and they always thought, “That little boy, I got to help him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">So I felt very fortunate and I tried to do my best whe -- in whatever I did and in most cases, apparently succeeded because I was never canned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">I was never fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">I was called on the carpet from time to time and told what should not be done and what should be done, but never was really punished, as my document states. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">He is going to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and he was never punished, except before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1600">QUESTION:  When you look back at your time, particularly as in the underground, how do you account for your choices? </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">Your choices which were almost instinctively to fight and resist, versus just obeying the Germans or trying to wait it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">How do you account for those choices you made?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1603">ANSWER:  Well, I thought that -- I thought it was inborn, because all my forefathers were fighters and active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">I had a grand-grand-grandfather who fought the Soviet -- the Soviet -- the Russian Souse regime and ended in say -- with a death sentence and later on was commuted to 25 years in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">I had people who fought with the Polish legion during Napoleonic wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">I had forefathers who had served in diplomatic service and were active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">I had my father, who wore -- fought in the first World War on three fronts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">He fought with the Russians against the Prussians and with the Prussians against the French, with the -- with the French and Polish against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">So I guess, if it wasn’t inborn, at least I could think back about it and act accordingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">Didn’t want to be bystander. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And of course, my ego was enormous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">I knew I could do almost anything, and went and most of the time I didn’t, sometime I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1613">QUESTION:  An-And if you could talk a little bit about the Polish culture in terms of how to react to authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">A German survivor -- I read that she said as a German, she just -- just obeyed when they -- when the SS told her to do something, she did it and she -- she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and she never considered saying no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">What about the Polish culture and -- and within your own family, what kind of things were you taught?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1616">ANSWER:  Polish people in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , are very contrary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">Also very disputatious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">You would say -- have four Poles dis-discussing certain set of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">They would have seven ideas and nobody gives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">Consequently, when we get hit, we hit back hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in history, was overran many times by neighbors who were 10 times more powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided and subdivided by three neighbors who were -- each one was three times as big as <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and being under occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had, oh my God, probably half a dozen really heavy uprisings and probably dozen and a half of smaller uprisings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">They were being killed, they were being hung, they were drowned, they were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">They were -- spent time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdaburg</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">German citadel prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">Polish -- creator of Polish state, after first World War, Marshall Pisoutski spent couple years in a German prison in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madgaburg</span> <span class="BUILDING">German prison</span> in Madgaburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">So, we kind of thought that we are the fighting people and we tried to prove it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">Most of the time we did not succeed, at times we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">That was probably kind of loyalty to -- to your state, loyalty to your nation, especially, and acting upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And probably most of the -- most of it is that we are qu -- we were quite foolhardy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">When I corresponded with my first cousin, who spent about 10 years in a <span class="BUILDING">Communist prison</span> -- after she was released, we wrote to each other before she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">I said, “Well gee, why didn’t you go out and fight [indecipherable] And she said, “We have grown now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">We want to conduct ourself properly, we want to go by vote, we want to go and work hard and perhaps we will succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">We must have grown.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">Well, when I knew <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and when I knew myself and my se -- environment during the war and before the war, looks like we have not grown yet, we just went and hid and fight -- and fought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1635">QUESTION:  I want you to think back to the point when you were 1n the dis -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wildeflecken</span> and when you found out -- no, let me ask you this first, why did you want to emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1636">ANSWER:  For the simple reason that, as I mentioned before, that was a <span class="NPIP">seventh heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">And everybody wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">And I had had friends -- close friends and the wite of the family worked for the emigration office to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> <span class="BUILDING">emigration office</span> to America and he hel -- she helped to put me on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">And eventually my name came, my number came, I was called in and was asked to collect documentation and went through the doctors and -- and all kind of commissions, question this and question that, went through the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">Especially I had a hard time with a doctor or else I didn’t have a hard time with a doctor, but Captain Vulcanovsky said, “Well, you have -- your lungs are scarred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">You'll never go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">Come on, let’s have your documents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">So he took my little card with the x-ray on it and he said, “Here, stick this one on.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1644">What 1s that?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1645">This is my x-ray, I never had any problem with lungs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">That was it, I came under false pretenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">I came here as a former tuberculosis patient, almost dying there and I haven’t been sick a day since I came here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1648">QUESTION:  But your captain put his picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1649">ANSWER:  His -- His x-ray --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Instead of yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1650">ANSWER:  Instead of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">Even though they still -- there was still that little typed <span class="DLF">line</span> that I could not -- I could not launder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">It says, “Pleveredes maxudatevair.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">So then doctor -- American doctor looks and say, “You had the Pleveredes maxudatevair here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">How come your lungs are so clear?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">I said, “Oh, it cleared up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">And he said, “Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">I understood the okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">He spoke to the interpreter and my English was kind of a little --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So without that clear x-ray, you wouldn’t have been able to come?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2077">ANSWER:  His name 1s Paul, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">So, his musical name is Paul Raymond, because nobody can pronounce Czyzewski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">His middle name is Raymond and that was also his grandfather’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">So, when he had a band, first band and a second band and a third band, he always was Paul Raymond.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2081">QUESTION:  Have you told him about your experiences in the underground and in the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2082">ANSWER:  Little. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">Little. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">He -- I don’t know, he may be slightly interested now, but he previously was not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">And I never made an effort to teach him Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">When he was small, he knew few phrases in Polish, but since we speak only English at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , being th -- see, being that Sylvia is Yankee, we didn’t indulge much in Polish and he did not learn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">Now, he is somewhat interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">It was kind of interesting last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">He brought a form from Internal Revenue Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">Did any -- did your parents or any of your relatives spend time in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">So he was laughing it and I was laughing it and Paul -- they want me to fill 1t out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">So he said, “Sure, if you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> , fill it out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">And you know, if you were in American army, you were 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> for a few d -- five days, a week or two, then you were pulled back and you were put in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">So he said, “Well, gee, how long were you in forz -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">I said, “Two and a half years.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="2096">Two and a half years? </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">Nobody could make it for two and a half years.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">I said, “Well, some of us did, some of us didn’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">So I wrote on that form, two and a half years in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">And I wrote where, at that <span class="REGION">territory</span> and then fighting whom and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">And I send it back and never heard from the -- from them again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2102">QUESTION:  Did that spark his interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2103">ANSWER:  Somewhat, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">Occasionally, now, when I t-talk about it, he -- he listens and when we did get those videos, he said, “Well, gee, someday maybe I wi -- I should watch it, I should listen to it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">I said, “Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">You get bored to death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2107">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit about your work with the Mung refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">You, yourself, of course, were a refugee at one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2109">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2110">QUESTION:  A-And -- and you and your wife work with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2111">ANSWER:  Well, I did very little of that work, because I had a full time job at all times and doing something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">But Sylvia was working as an instructor in a program, English for foreign born. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">So she took her -- went to one parish and took individual Mung people and Indochinese people out of the classes and tutor -- tutored them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">Yeah, Vietnamese refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">And later on, we befriended --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It was not Mung, it was Vietnamese?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2116">ANSWER:  Vietnamese first. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">A2: It was the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2118">QUESTION:  Okay, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2119">ANSWER:  First. </span><span class="sentence" id="2120">And then Sylvia had quite a few Mung people that she tutored -- went to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2121">And from time to time, or quite a few times, we would invite group of Mung people to have picnic with us here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">And it was kind of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">We invite 15 Mung people and maybe five or six would show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">But also, 47 may show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">So one time, we had invited about 15 and I think we had about 40 - some. </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">Kids running all over and they were so well behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">I mean, you could -- I mean, neighbors didn’t complain, nobody di -- did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">We had games and we had a lot of food and the kids went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> and watched the ducks and did all kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">And we still meet some of the -- those Mungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">We are out of touch with them presently, but occasionally meet some of them, especially when we go to a <span class="BUILDING">vegetable market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">There was a beautiful, little Mung girl that Sylvia was friends with her mother and her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">We see her occasionally selling vegetable and we say hello and chat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">And then, just about every ti -- well, not every time, but when Sylvia went to tutor them, they would have some little thing -- little Mung thing made and there was an older man, whose name wa -- name was M-Mr. Washan. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">He said, “Sylvia, here’s a free gift for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">So, she would get a little trinket or little embroidery square or one time she did get a large embroidery kind of a picture, made by -- as the Mung people make.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2136">QUESTION:  Did you sponsor a family? </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">I don’t know if it was Mung or Vietnamese or Filipino?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2138">ANSWER:  Yes, we -- my -- our <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> spons-sponsored two Vietnamese boys about 20 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">And then when parish tried to divest them -- itself over -- [indecipherable] we took them in and they stayed with us for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">The young -- we found them jobs and the older one became independent quickly and moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">The younger one went to a <span class="BUILDING">local Catholic college</span> and graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">And he kind of stayed on and off with us, for about four or five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">Eventually, he became independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">Three years? </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">Okay, three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">Became independent, has a new jo -- great job, has a fat American wife and three kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">Has a big <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and lives next door to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">His name is Vonsan and we see him every day, we say hello every day and we visit back and forth frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">And later on, we sponsored two of his brothers, who father sent out, they became boat people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">Ended somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> or somewhere and we sponsored those two. </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">They came, stayed with us short time, but most of the time did not, because the -- Vonsan became independent, had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">So we, of course, we visited a lot back and forth and those two boys are too married -- also married, have children and families and jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">And we sometime visit with them, sometime see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">And there was a large group of Vietnamese boys who used to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milos</span> or for a visit and they still occasionally come and see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2155">Even bring us little gifts, especially after 15 years, just about every one gave him a clo -- I -- gave us a clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">I have several funny looking clocks around. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">Gar-Garish things with butterflies and -- and crazy things in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2158">Holy -- Holy statues in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2159">QUESTION:  Why was that important for you personally to do, the sponsoring of the refugees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2160">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2161">Sylvia is very good person and she is very sympathetic to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2162">And seeing that I was a refugee at one time, we kind of did little sponsoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="2163">And also, our parish -- our Catholic parish sponsored many, many Laotian, Vietnamese and Mung families. </span><span class="sentence" id="2164">And for a long time, we were, and then I was on a committee that worked with them, finding them jobs and <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live and collecting clothing and -- and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2165">Presently, we are not doing much, or hardly any of it, because I’m old and Sylvia is catching up with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2166">I’m ancient and she -- she 1s getting old, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2167">She is not nearly as old as Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">Many, many years younger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2169">QUESTION:  When you speak with Americans about the war, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , or the Holocaust, what do you find? </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">I mean, what do you find people know or think about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2171">ANSWER:  Well, people find it unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="2172">People are, at times, shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="2173">But, mostly, people that I talk to about it, is people that I go to give talk about it, like in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">college</span> or -- or group of people that are interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2174">So then, they ask many questions and I answer the questions and sometime elaborate, sometime I hard -- hide a lot of stuff, because they would be too shocking for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2175">And most American people, sus -- especially young people, are completely uninformed and know very little about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2176">Even adults did not know much about it at that time, or did not pay attention toward the end of time, when the news drifted in here about the atrocities, about American army freeing a lot of dead people in a concentratio -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2177">Many people did not batay -- pay attention to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2178">QUESTION:  Does it surprise you that people don’t know the history?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2179">ANSWER:  No, it does not. </span><span class="sentence" id="2180">Apparently <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> don’t teach mut -- much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2181">Also, I note it was the last two or three years, all of ca -- all of a sudden, just about every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had a -- a Short course on the Holocaust and a short course on the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="2182">And that’s mostly the pla -- those other <span class="NPIP">places</span> that invite me to come and talk to them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2183">So that is somewhat gratifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="2184">But, for a long time, people were very uninformed about. </span><span class="sentence" id="2185">Also, throughout all the time previously, and now, very well educated people, like for instance, college professors, tried to disprove that the Holocaust ever existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2186">There’s a group of professor that’s <span class="BUILDING">UCLA</span> , who are very vocal about it, telling everybody who wants to listen and everybody who doesn’t want to listen that Holocaust never existed, that was just a concoction made by certain groups of people, trying to influence us this way or that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2187">QUESTION:  And -- And how does that effect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2188">ANSWER:  Well, if I had them nearby, I would feel like bashing their heads in, or telling them off and since I have never met one who would voice that kind of opinion, I do feel upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="2189">But we have people who are stupid, we have people who are prejudiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="2190">We have pe-people who are hateful and also people who are uninformed or misinformed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2191">QUESTION:  I guess this is my last question, which is what do you think you carry with you from the experience, especially of resisting and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="2192">Ho-How did it shape you and the rest of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2193">ANSWER:  Well, I’m somewhat satisfied that what I did was not in vain. </span><span class="sentence" id="2194">Also, I grieve greatly over those who -- who perished and I’m very grateful for having been able to survive and I frequently pray about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2195">And if it did me -- if it made me a better person or not, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2196">As I previously mentioned, I have never lost my faith and in most circumstances, I am trying to be halfway good Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2197">And at times I’m not satisfied with it, but I have to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2198">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d like to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2199">ANSWER:  No, I think we talked blue streak, forever and a day and I really don’t know what else I could add that would except -- I add to it, except that I’m really glad I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2200">I am so grateful being able to live in a good, free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that with all it’s mishaps as -- and -- and thing that happen that are not great and not savory, still is a great, free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that lives up to it’s ideals.</span></p>
