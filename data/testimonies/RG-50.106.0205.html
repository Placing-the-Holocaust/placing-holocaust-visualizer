<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  When you say because of anti-Semitism, they were not permitting Jews to register births.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  There was some kind of a skirmish and they were beating up every Jew there to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So my father was afraid to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So I’m five days younger.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Are you an only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Iam an only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Let us talk about your parents and how long your family had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">You were born in what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bacu</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> which was on the <span class="REGION">eastern side</span> , actually northeastern side of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Both my parents come up from very simple background. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I am actually the first person who ever went to, above fourth grade or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I have never known my grandparents, except my maternal grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My paternal grandmother was killed during World War I. And my paternal grandparents both died from an epidemic of cholera. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So my father and his four siblings were raised by a grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Even a grandmother was not available. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">She died too from cholera. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So in this situation my parents didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> except to learn how to read and write and when they were able, I think at age ten or 11, 12 maximum, they had to learn some kind of a profession in order to be able to exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So my father learned to be a tailor and my mother learned to be a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They were very wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My mother was full of pep and optimistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My father was very intelligent and he sat with an encyclopedia in every single day just to learn and very interested in politics of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  What were their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  My mother name was Laura and my father’s name was Jacob, just like my grandson. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And they, my father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> which is a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> also in the <span class="REGION">eastern side</span> , but he found work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bacu</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">That’s where he met my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They got married and —
QUESTION:  She was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bacu</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">She was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bacu</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They got married in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And, because they both worked they made money. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They moved out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> cause my mother lived with her mother with my https://collections.ushmm.org May 2, 2013 grandmother in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish enclave</span> , let’s say. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Not call a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So they moved out and they got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it even had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and they did very, very well until the war came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Do you remember what <span class="DLF">street</span> ?</span></p>
