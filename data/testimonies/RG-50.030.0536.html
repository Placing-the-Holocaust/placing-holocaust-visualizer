QUESTION:  Can — can we — can we go back a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Ju-Ju-Just bef-before — before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Because your brother was born in 1932, is that correct?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with your father like? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Was it — was it a close relationship before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  It was — it was a reasonably close relationship with my father and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And my mother was the stricter of the two, and my father was the one that you always would run for shelter and assistance when my mother was getting too tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  And what ki — how tough did she get? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What — wha-what did she do?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  We heard things, we were expecting things. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was not unusual, and it was not at all uncommon for politics to be discussed at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So that when the Nazis attacked on September 1, 1939, it did not come as a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And my first memory August 12, 2009 of the war was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi airplane</span> flying very low, and somebody living in the same <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> jumping out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a small revolver, the kind of — the kind that ladies would have in their bags, and he shot at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  So even at such a young age you thought that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yes, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But 1-1n — in 1939 in September, your father was already in the Polish army, 1s that correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So his —
ANSWER:  Right, he was in the Polish army — he was in the Polish army because there was a call to arms, you know, asking all eligible males to present themselves at this, that and the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But as it turned out later on, they didn’t even get to provide them with uniforms, let alone with arms, when the Polish army was crushed by the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  So where yo — you went with your mother and your brother, an-and — and was — did you go with your grandparents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  So one morning a couple of Nazi soldiers and local collaborators appeared in — in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they gave us five minutes to get ready, and they deported us on August 12, 2009 the other si — to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San river</span> , which was to become the Soviet zone of occupation, as distinct from the German zone of occupation, which they decided to make free of Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  So you were deported, this wasn’t — this wasn’t a decision that was made by your mother to — to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  That’s correct, that’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I remember we arrived at the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">There was a — a <span class="DLF">roadside</span> — a roadside sign which says in German, nach <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Palastina</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And we were just — we were just pushed to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and then the Germans returned to their side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and we were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> for a few days, and it was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I remember we stopped in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> , and my mother wanted a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she could wash me and my kid brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And it turned out that the only place where you could get washed was the local mikveh, the <span class="BUILDING">religious bathhouse</span> where — where women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves again clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with a single industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The industry was making twittel(ph) — making the phylacteries that observant Jews used for prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And then a few days later we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army disintegrated, and the — there was absolutely nothing else for him to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And there August 12, 2009 were people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And that’s how — and that’s how he found us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Did he know that you had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that side of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And so he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> , and so did we, and that’s where we met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  So, you were not deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> , you were deported over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San river</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  That’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  And — and then you had to figure out what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  I mean, your mother had to figure out what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  That’s right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> , were they terrible? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I mean were there — were there a lot of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no shortages, and whoever lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span> would try to share with us some food or whatever else was available.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  So, when you were sent over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San river</span> , that — that — you were walking, I gather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  That’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">August 12, 2009
QUESTION:  Did you have a little backpack — not a backpack, but a knapsack with you or something?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  A little, but not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Again — again, it was some bread and cheese.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And, did you walk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  And were there — you had relatives there, I gather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  My mother’s sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  We stayed in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for several months until the deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  So it was just a few months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Just a few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  So you get there in September, and you leave — August 12, 2009
ANSWER:  And we left next spring, when the — the Russian authorities asked all the refugees who came from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , who expressed their preference, the preferences being to remain a Soviet citizen and stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnopol</span> , or to go back to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> from which they were ejected by the Nazis, which is what we chose to do, because that’s where most of the family was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , and some even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaroslaw</span> , because not all of us were deported of the same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So you wanted to go back.</span></p>
