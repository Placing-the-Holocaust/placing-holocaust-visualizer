<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Is that why they decided to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  They decided to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for one reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">That they shouldn't see like it was such a smoke that you wouldn't see where a German is — where a Jew is. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">The Germans they didn't see the people, that's why we were able to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">That's the only reason we were able to tear up, it was like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed with wires, and we were able to open these wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The first person that opened these wires, died, but then the people started running because it was opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was like a wire like you could hurt yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It wasn't like electric, but you could hurt yourself.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  You don't know if it had been planned for a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  No, I don't think it was planned for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They didn't know, when they knew they were going to kill the Jews, they knew a day before, but the Germans thought the Jews were going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They couldn't know when they're going to get killed because they're going to kill them anyway like everybody is going to go like a sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Every <span class="NPIP">place</span> they went like sheep, so they're going to go here like sheep, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But the only thing they didn't think was here that these people are different kind of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">These people will not go like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They won't let themselves get killed like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They'll fight and they'll do everything they could to make them impossible to do something, to just take the people to the <span class="DLF">graves</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Why do you think that your community acted so differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  I don’t — I think that there were many like a Rev-Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They came from the party that was Begin's not like any other party. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">These people are very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">These people wouldn't let themselves, like that Rochczyn. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">You know I still see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He had glasses on. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I see him how he looks. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I'll never forget his face, that beautiful face that — he took an ax. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He was taking an ax and giving the German over the head you can't imagine in that moment how as a child I felt that you don't just let yourself get killed, but you kill back. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">You do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I felt that in a few minutes I'm going to fall down anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They're going to shoot me, because they were shooting, but I didn't care if I'm going to die, because that time you don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You haven't got anything to think about that you're going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Nobody does. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You think well I'm going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">At least I'm going to die knowing that a German got killed even if it's one or two or three that somebody — that they just didn't go like sheeps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  So this was a real spiritual turning point for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  That was something that I felt so good <span class="NPIP">inside</span> even though I knew I'm not going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I didn't think that now I'm going to sit now and talk to somebody about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That I'll be able to tell my story, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  When it was decided that you were going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> down, and — I don't know — who's idea this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  It was a few people, and I think it has a lot to do with these Zionist people, a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">These people were tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  So, there was a strong relationship between the Zionist movement and the council?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  I met my friend after. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Somebody told me my friend is living not far from me and I went over. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I walked with somebody, a man that he was a journalist before the war but he was in the partisans and I asked him, “please, could you take me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He was a Jewish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I said, “Could you take me to see, I think I heard that my friend is living in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so and so” — I don't remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but it wasn't far. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We had to walk maybe an hour, hour and half. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">He said, “sure, come with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I went there and the father was sitting there and he said “I'm going to take Feigele (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I found out she's alive and I'm going to bring her — she's with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">She's by people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So, I said, “could I come with you?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="468">He says “sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="469">When I came over there she was full of lice, you know, and you know what we did, we took ashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We didn't have any soap, and we take the ashes and we put in a piece of cloth by Christian people, like Russian people and we put some cloth and we had warm water, you didn't have water. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You had to bring water from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We didn't have water in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We made her we put her in something to make her a box and took her out from these and then we went back with her and I took her out and I had lice all over my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We washed her once and another time with water and then the woman gave us something to dry her. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">These people didn't have anything to dry her and she got dressed up with something that she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">She didn't have nothing to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Then her father took her back and we were sleeping at night and she dreamed her grandmother said that Germans were running after us and they were going to kill us, and I had a dream too and I woke up and I was screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I says, “You know they're going to kill us again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The whole nights, all these years I have dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I always wake up with dreams that they they're going to kill my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I have three children now, that they're going to kill my children and I'm going to be alone again. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I'm going to have nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So, that time, we both fell asleep and we dreamed that we're running and we're running and they're going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Somebody's going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They're running after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">She said, “I have such a dream that they're going to kill us again,” and I said, “yes, I have the same dream.” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We woke up in a sweat. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I stayed with her for a few days and I went back where I was, where that Ukrainian woman, she took care of me very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  Do you think when you look back on this that life was different for girls and for women than it was for the men and the boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">A woman wasn't — I think by the Russians a woman was more than it was by the Poles or someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But I think that it was a difference, like they thought a woman can do nothing, men could do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Even no matter how aggressive you were and how much you were able to do so a woman is not much, she can do as much as a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  You were a tough kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Did you feel that your responsibilities were the same as the boys your age or that you were treated differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  I didn't think at that time how I was treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I just felt “I'm going to survive and I'm going to look where my father is.” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I didn't think about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I didn't think how they're going to treat me how they treat me. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I knew I had to survive and I'm going to do everything possible to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  When you were with the partisans did everybody have certain responsibilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  We had the responsibility to help in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Like I was with the Ukrainian woman, we went — I wanted to milk the cows, I learned how to milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I went to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> with the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It wasn't like now they have tractors. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I loved to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I loved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  Were the boys working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> also?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  So everyone worked together?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Do you know if when they made certain decisions whether the women were included in making decisions or whether it was much the way —?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  I think the men only, not the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They told the women what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I don't think the women made any decisions all together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Women filled a very traditional role?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Even the Russians, they thought “A Jew can't even fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He doesn't even know how to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">How a Jew could fight.” </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But, the Jews — they gave them guns and they were fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  So, even in the partisan groups, they were very good to the Jews but they wanted to make their own decisions and they didn't include the Jews in these?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  No, they took the Jews to fight also, but they didn't — I don't think they thought a Jew could fight as much as a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I don't believe that they thought that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  So, from the way that these groups were organized, was most of the decision making done by the Soviets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Yes, the Soviets, but I don't think they made a difference between a Jew and a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The only thing they thought was that the people by themselves, not in the more like somebody was a lieutenant, or they run away from the army or something, they run away from the Germans, I don't think they thought about the Jew being different. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I don't believe feeling even then by Ukrainian women that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She didn't think of me as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">She thought of me as a little girl that's run away from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and she wants to survive and she wants to help me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  I understand that, what I'm trying to figure out is initially when you joined these people, was there a structure in place where the non-Jews were making the decisions and they were basically hiding you and you were helping them but it was their movement, or was everybody —
ANSWER:  No, I think the men made the decision mostly, the Soviet men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  The Soviet men, or Soviet and Jewish men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  I think there were a lot of Jewish men that they made decisions too. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They were lieutenants or like big shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">They made decisions too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Now, let me ask you a slightly different question. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Were you — did you come from a religious family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  No, not a religious but non not religious either. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We ate kosher in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> — like even now, I'm not going to eat pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I can't even if I want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  So when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for several years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  We had to eat whatever they had, but I never ate pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">If I knew in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> that's Yom Kippur — one time a friend, he is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> but he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> to live — he passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">When he told, “today is Yom Kippur,” he passed by like he didn't have nothing to wear and I saw him and I didn't even believe he's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And he passed by and he said to me, “today is Yom Kippur.” </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I didn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I didn't want to eat anything even though we didn't have much to eat, we were hungry most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and that Ukrainian woman said to me that the Germans were on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They surrounded us, the Germans, and we were lying in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> very deep like in the time that was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> already, and we're lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">She said to me, “Make with your feet like this because otherwise the feet will fall off. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They came off,” she said, “make with your feet, just work with them, just like exercise with them, do something, because otherwise you're going to lose your feet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Up there they were shooting us with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and around they were shouting, the Germans were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">In the middle of that the partisans came and they started fighting with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You know they were going like, how could I say it in English — even if I’m so many years, since I was 18 years old in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> — na shtyki’, they were going with big knives like this one on one. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They said, “we're going to get killed, we're going to get killed,” and we were lying in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and all of sudden from nowhere they came and they saved probably our lives at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Were there other holidays that you were aware of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I didn't even know which day it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We didn't have calendars, we didn't have nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  So religion wasn't that important to you while you were hiding out?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">QUESTION:  It's just hard to understand why some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> were much, much stronger this way than others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">ANSWER:  I think because they had somebody like Rochczyn there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">If they would have more like these, like now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">How has <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Because there were these people, they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">That's why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">These were part of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">They learned to be like that.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  When I look back, I wish I could have said to everybody in all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , “Don't let yourself just go like sheep to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Fight back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Don't let yourself, don't go to the <span class="DLF">graves</span> just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">If you go to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> let it be written — let 1t be said that you were fighting and you didn't give up, but you were fighting for something that you believed that, you have to fight, not to go like a sheep but to go like a person, like a human being, to fight back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I believe it now, too.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">ANSWER:  I never give up even now, no matter hard you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We had hard times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Like now, I married my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">He was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">He was twice in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">He had surgery after I married him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">He had a surgery by-pass and then five times since we live in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">One year he was five times with infections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">He went through a lot, so I never gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I never said “he's going to die,” and I was sitting and talking to him and I said, “You're not going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">You'll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">You're going to pull through it because you have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">You have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">You have to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I was saying to myself, “No he's not going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">It's not going to happen to him because we're going to fight and we're going to survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">It's just like anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I'm a fighter now too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I always believe when I go to sleep at night it's like a nice letter that's going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I live day by day like that like it's going to come a letter tomorrow, something good is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Like I'm waiting for the next day, every single day in my life I'm waiting for something good to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Even if it's not going to happen, I still believe that it will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I never believe that it's going to be an ordinary day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I believe that it's going to be the most beautiful day tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  Is that the way you felt when you were in hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">ANSWER:  I always felt like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I think I was born like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">QUESTION:  Just tell me briefly, how did you meet Joseph, your current husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  I knew him a long time because — I met my current husband a long time ago but I didn't know him, but a few years ago, when he moved in with his wife — I used to live on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and he moved into my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">He moved 1n with his wife and his wife had Alzheimer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">She was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I saw them and I knew them and I said — I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I let him in — I said, “These are two old people I'm going to let them in, let the <span class="DLF">door</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">They're carrying parcels. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">They moved into that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Then I heard from far his wife said, “That's Zina.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I said, “That's Icek?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And I call him Icek, because his name 1s Icek and not Joseph. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I said, “My God, he looks so old and that man is not so old.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">He was about 63 years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I said, “My God, what has happened to them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">At that time, his sister in law came — and I used to go a few times to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to have coffee there with his wife too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">His wife didn't know nothing because she was very sick, Alzheimer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">She was still a young woman because she died at 63 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So, I came up to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was — I saw — when his wife died, his sister-in-law came and she stayed by me upstairs, instead of staying in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I gave her my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because my husband was dead already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">She says, “You know what, you two are so good for each other, you're going to marry him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And I didn't even think about it because first of all, his wife just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I'm going to think that I'm going to marry him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I said, “You're crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Anja (ph), why are you talking like that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">That was Erwin's wife, and I knew Erwin since 1951, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I said, “You're crazy, don't talk like that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">But every single day that his wife died, I started asking him to go for a walk because he was very depressed and he was talking about his wife all the time and we were going and walking a lot, and talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Then, I fell in love with him after, and the same thing happened to him I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So, I never believed that in that age I'm going to fall in love with somebody, because I think I love him more than my life because after that he was so sick a few times he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Quite a few times, and I stood by him and I always gave him faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">When he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a by-pass and this is the second one, because 15 years ago he had one bypass and this was the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">He thought he was not going to live because the doctor told him that that by-pass is not going to be able to make a by-pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I told him, “Don't believe the doctor what he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I heard many doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They talk to the patient and they die before the patient dies, so don't listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">You'll see that you're going to be alive and you're going to be able to have the operation.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">A few days later he came and he says, “You know, what we're going to try to operate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">He was so happy, just like he was going to go to dance, and I said to him like that, “Before you go to the operation, have faith, believe that you're going to live and after you're going to see we're going to buy the most beautiful things for the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">You're going to sell all the old junks you have and we're going to buy the nicest things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">You're going to see you're going to have the most beautiful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Just believe it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">He was six weeks in the intensive care and I was sitting every single day and talking like that. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Just believe it, you'll see, you're going to have a good life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Just like I thought in the time of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I didn't think I was going to live but I still didn't want to believe it because I think I'm a survivor.</span></p>
