ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  -- excuse me, <span class="DLF">90" Street</span> -- I got lost getting here -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">This is a follow up I don’t know what the date was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">This is tape number one, side A. Whoa. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">A: [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Were you asking questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  This -- As you know, a follow up interview, it’s looking at really, the kind of post Holocaust years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  I was curious, you said that you’re going to <span class="BUILDING">Disney World</span> tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes, I am, for the third and last time, with my grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  What did -- When you were a little kid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , could you have imagined that now, this many years later, this is what you’d be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  No, I certainly did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But I think that’s probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too, that you don’t really think what you’re going to do as an adult, or even the fact that you’re going to be grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I mean, that’s very old people, and it’s very hard to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> with my father, going to, not <span class="BUILDING">Disneyland</span> , but to <span class="BUILDING">playgrounds</span> , and <span class="DLF">theme parks</span> , in a very small way, that - with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller coasters</span> , and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  [inaudible] ... Is having a good time important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Well, 1 -- when you say important, yes it certainly 1s, I’d rather have a good time than a bad time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family remain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly is important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Did the -- the going to the <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> with your family as a child --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  -- how did that stay with you during all of these quite un-amusing times you’ve had --
ANSWER:  That always stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It’s really strange, because I know we’re going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding like a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how terribly it affected them afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I’ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Of providing me with food when there wasn’t any to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  You said they made up a fiction, what do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Did you see the movie, “Life is Beautiful’? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The Italian film that won all the awards? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">A lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I think you would have had to see the movie to know what I’m talking about, but it’s -- when you see the movie, knowing it’s about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the movies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was 1n the wrong movie, because there was a comedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And it was basically about a father protecting his child. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I didn’t think it was trivialized at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn’t, and I guess I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I don’t know if that makes any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I -- Yo-You had said that you previously had been able -- your -- your mother had instructed you that if she said 1t was black, it was black, and you were not to question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That’s absolutely true. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it’s very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it’s one thing, it’s -- if it’s -- yes, that’s absolutely -- that’s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn’t quite as difficult for me to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">You know, your -- you speak when you’re spoken to, and you don’t question a lot, and I don’t think today’s generation would get away with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Were there other instances where your mother -- where you had to comply with your mother when you knew she was not telling the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn’t a ma -- even a matter of complying, but she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember that very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran into a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made me a cake, and it needed an egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don’t remember all that well, but I don’t think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you’re hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn’t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I was 10 years old, so I didn’t go into it, in major, you know, depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Was it primarily your mother then, who shaped you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My father and I had a wonderful relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He was a very quiet and very loving man, very successful in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, 1s that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don’t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn’t look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing 1s -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or were stopped on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , my father always stayed in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">In -- You know, during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and we went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened, was he a strong presence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Oh yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Every Sunday we went to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> , we went to the <span class="DLF">playground</span> , we went to the <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> , and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , or the wall of my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and every evening after he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , we would play a game of identifying capitals. </span><span class="sentence" id="64"><span class="COUNTRY">Countries</span> all over the world, and eventually <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> , and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oceans</span> , and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The fathers came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">In some ways, I think I was probably closer to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Is he still alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Excuse me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Is he still alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He died when I was pregnant with my daughter, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was -- Actually, I was the last person that he saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I went up to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , in 1957, to show him my first batch of maternity clothes, and he died on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fifth Avenue bus</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , lived on <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> , my mother’s still there, and he got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Was he ill?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  He had a heart condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was really not even aware of how serious it was, I mean, he was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that day, he wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Are you still close to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Yes, my mother 1s having a very hard time right now, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother is 87, and she has dementia. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, up to two years ago, she was in better health than most of my contemporaries, and actually, she still 1s, except for the fact that she gets very confused, she’s getting depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She still goes to the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonic</span> , she still goes to the opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">She lives at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> , but she’s aware that she’s not as well as she was, not physically, but mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They say -- I don’t know what the difference is, but they say it’s not Alzheimer’s, it’s dementia, she has aortic stenosis, which is a clogging of the main <span class="DLF">artery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Blood doesn’t flow to the brain too well, and she’s really scared, and it’s -- it’s really rough right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  The cake that you talked about, where she stole the egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Do you eat cake today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Yeah, I love cake, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Yellow cake?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yellow cake, chocolate cake preferably, but when desperate, I'll eat yellow cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I love apricot jam, that was -- that went in it, and one of the other things we used to do, since food was scarce, we used to have these -- you know these kielbasa, it’s like a hot dog, but it’s like a salami texture, and it’s very long and skinny, and I don’t know how we acquired a piece, and my mother would cut one tiny, tiny little wedge, or circle, and cut it up into many, many, many pay -- many pieces, and pretend that that was a sandwich, or a piece of bread with it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But instead of like eating the whole thing, it was rationed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  You still eat that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The only thing that I don’t eat, which really was sent to us after the war by my grandfather when they would send us care packages, 1s Spam. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I had -- We had no clue. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They would send us Spam, and they sent nail polish, that they -- we would sell, and I don’t know what other food product, but I adored ham, and the Spam had that kind of a taste. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And we had, you know, never seen canned products before, so that was my very favorite, and I must tell you, when we came here, and I said Spam, everybody looked at me like thi -- and I always meant to buy Spam, and it’s sort of like buying the “Enquirer,” you’re embarrassed to buy it, but you look at -- over somebody’s shoulder at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">checkout counter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But I’ve never bought it, and I always wondered if I bought it, what it would taste like today, but that was the only thing that I ate then, and I have not eaten since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So clearly you didn’t keep kosher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">No, we were definitely -- I guess by Stateside standards, we would be Reform, but there it was Conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We sat separately, but it was -- we were not kosher, we did not speak Yiddish, my grandparents didn’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We were definitely assimilated upper middle class Hungarian Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Do you think that helped you when you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  You know, it’s very hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that they’re in, and they don’t say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or lived in -- I don’t know, the <span class="REGION">lower east side</span> , or somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren’t poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jackson Heights</span> , and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don’t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn’t starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So, you know, I don’t know what it would have been like. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I think I assimilated very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We got here in the spring of ’47, and I went to a very fancy girl’s camp in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , that my daughter subsequently went to, that’s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they’d be going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hunter High School</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">Hunter College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I started with one language and finished with the other with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they certainly spoke it well enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I married an American, and I had absolutely no reason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I would have assimilated differently, or not as easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Do you think of yourself as Jewish now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Absolutely, I always have. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We converted for a short time, strictly for acquiring papers that they -- they thought may have saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It probably wouldn’t have, but in those days you did everything that you could to -- just in case. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Several of my parents friends, when they came here, remained whatever religion they converted to, and raised their children, whatever they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I --I’m -- You know, I know them, but I -- they weren’t -- I was not friendly with them, so I don’t know if they were Catholic, or Protestant, or what they converted to, I really don’t know, but one of my mother’s friend’s son is a minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So -- And a lot of them intermarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I married twice, both Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I’ve always belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , we always observed the holidays -- holy days. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My daughter was Confirmed, and married by a rabbi, and they are really quite -- well they’re -- they belong to a <span class="BUILDING">Reform synagogue</span> also, but they are a very traditional Jewish family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> do you belong to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Here? </span><span class="sentence" id="134"><span class="BUILDING">Temple Emmanuel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But you know, it’s interesting, because my grandfather, and grandmother, who came here in 1939 joined <span class="BUILDING">Temple Emmanuel</span> , because it was very much like the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> we belonged to in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Have you ever been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , it’s not a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , I mean it’s -- you know, everybody always things <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> has these little <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox shuls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">This is the biggest <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in Europe, and I think the second biggest in the world, it 1s huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It’s very impressive looking, it’s probably not all that different looking than Emmanuel, maybe a little bit smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You do sit separately, and it is Conservative, so they do wear talisses, it’s -- you know, I don’t think they do at Emmanuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But it’s not by any means Orthodox, or -- and as I said, I left when I was 13, so I didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> or anything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And my grandfather joined <span class="BUILDING">Temple Emmanuel</span> , so when we came here, he started taking us to services there. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And as I got 0 -- you know, older, and I was married, I got my own membership, and I was Confirmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">No, my -- my parents were there also, and I was Confirmed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And -- And my daughter was raised there, went through <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , and was Confirmed there, so --
QUESTION:  Was it important to you that she [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I would have been very upset if hadn’t married one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Sounds like “Fiddler on the <span class="DLF">Roof</span> ,” but tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Was it important to your family that you marry a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  I don’t think it ever came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don’t think I ever dated anyone who wasn’t, and except for one young man who was absolutely gorgeous, that my daughter dated, a very, very bright young man, she only dated Jewish boys, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, I really don’t -- I don’t know if it was just the circle of friends that I traveled with was limited, I don’t know, I mean I -- I never dated anyone who wasn’t.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I don’t know if she would agree. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Actually, in many ways, even though her children are very different -- well, first of all they’re three boys, which is a very different thing than one daughter, and times are different, and what fashionable is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I don’t mean fashionable clothes-wise, but behavior-wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But I think in many ways, she still 1s quite traditional, but not to the extent I -- when they were first married, and I saw my son-in-law taking his shirts to the laundry, I was appalled, and I was -- I just say, w -- you know, this is what you’re supposed to be doing, and she gave me a look like, you know, they’re his shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And you know, so -- but it was a very small thing, and I think my son-in-law’s a wonderful father, and I think with the children it’s definitely more of a joint venture than it was . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">My ex-husband was a very good father, but 1-it -- it was more the roles, you know, I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and had dinner ready, and the baby bathed, and all that, and he did a lot of stuff with her, because I think in our generation, I think that was becoming more of the thing, but they were the -- th -- they made the money, and I mean, you know, they had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Somebody had to go to work, and somebody had to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  What did you teach?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Well, I started out with <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and -- and I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- I went back for my Master’s when I was 40, and got a degree in special education. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">That was a fairly new degree they were giving, and I just kind of fell into it in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I substituted in a couple of special ed classes, and I didn’t have a clue what I was doing, but I really liked it, and I went back for my Master’s, and then I taught special ed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But I truly and truly believe that when you have children, when they’re little, you’re missing out on a great deal if you’re not with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And so are the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And it was interesting, this has nothing to do with the Holocaust, but I was watching Larry King yesterday, and Mary Tyler Moore was interviewed, and she said that was the one thing, if she had to do it all over again, she would have been <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I think she lost her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">There were a lot of tragedies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I don’t even know if she has any now, but I think her child either OD’d, or something bad happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I don’t know, I don’t remember what it was, but she was very adamant about it, and almost teary, that you owe your children, if you have them, to spend time with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And you can’t have it all, and I think that’s really true.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Oh, it was just -- I mean, it’s hard to describe, it was -- and he really enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Just before it was time to go, I thought to myself, I must be out of my mind, I mean here we are grandparents, he’s 13, he’s going to want to watch basketball game, and you know, look for his friends, and here I’m schlepping him, you know -- actually <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was his idea, and since we had like eight days, I thought, you know, that’s a bit much, and it was a great combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He of all my grandchildren, was the only one that’s really been interested in my history, and the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I’ve taken him several times to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We were there for the opening. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We’ve been there f -- at the capital, where they have the ceremony for the Holocaust, and he’s asked me many times to tell my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">When he was quite little, he invited me to Holocaust week at his <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , first grade class, and second grade class, as well as his <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> class. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So I have gone and spoken to the kids, and stuff, and I bought him books on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So he’s read a lot, and is quite interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The other two are not particularly interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Actually, my daughter took them to see “Life is Beautiful,” and -- and after that, my other two grandchildren sort of said, you know, what was it like for me, but it was -- took a -- s -- one sentence to answer, and that was it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  Way before I could afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">When I was quite young, I must have been in my 30’s, and we co-couldn’t really afford it, and a lot of my friends were starting to buy mink stoles, and whatever those awful things were. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And some jewelry, you know, and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">The next level of -- you know, when your husband does well, that next level of luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I’ve always loved going to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and <span class="BUILDING">galleries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I was involved with <span class="BUILDING">Brandeis University</span> National Women’s Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And the National Women’s Committee was the sole supporter of the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , because it was a fairly new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they didn’t have the alumni money coming in for a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , so the women, when the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was first formed, non-sectarian Jewish school, because education was very important, we supported the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We had a very active chapter -- junior chapter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , young. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">There was an older -- our parent’s generation, they formed a younger chapter, and I was very much involved with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And we did a lot of book reviews, and art classes, and I guess intellectually stimulating things, as opposed to a lot of other people were playing -- younger people, that had some free time were starting to play Mah Jongg, or Canasta, and all that kind of stuff, so this was -- we had a stock group, we were learning about that, so whatever was interesting, and I was always interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We went to look at the Barnes collection. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And there were a lot of artists popping up that were contemporary, unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="901"><span class="BUILDING">Galleries</span> that were appearing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soho</span> , that were new. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Andy Warhol was becoming, <span class="BUILDING">O.K Harris Gallery</span> was -- he used to give ladies art classes, before he opened the <span class="BUILDING">gallery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And they would donate stuff, and we would auction it off, or sell it, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And I was just really interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Some of the <span class="BUILDING">galleries</span> would give us cocktail parties, and fundraisers, and stuff, and that’s how that Picasso lino cut back there, it was the first thing that I bought, that was an independent thing, and it was a lot of money at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And we did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  You and your --
ANSWER:  My husband, my fir --
QUESTION:  -- first husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  First husband, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And then a lot of the little things that you see around like that Nevillson, and multiple -- they were all multiples, and somebody asked me the other day what a multiple is. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I said it’s a sa -- it’s like -- 1t’s like a lithograph, except in sculptures, and I was -- such a funny question. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">But a lot of artists did that in order to raise money. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Louise Nevillson was very supportive of Brandeis, and some <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And that was a very -- a less expensive way of acquiring things, because they were multiples, they were one of 50, one of a hundred, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And they certainly have, you know, done well along the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So I’m happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I mean, I didn’t buy it at the time, because I thought it was going to wor -- be worth it, cause I’m not selling anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But I just liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And it was all -- always -- I kind of like a little bit of the cutting edge stuff, although every once in awhile -- I went to see the new exhibit at the Metropolitan, I said, you know, I could get rid of some of this, acquire one of those, but I can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">It’s just -- gives me pleasure, I -- I just like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">We have some stuff really, and actually it’s in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> , that are very angry, and -- stuff I wouldn’t want to hang. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Nan Golden, do you know Nan Golden? </span><span class="sentence" id="922">We have a cookie portfolio, I mean, it’s not something I would hang, but I really like it, I think they’re wonderful photographs, and they’re very meaningful, I mean, that’s the generation of the drugs, and the OD’s and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I absolutely can’t think of the young man who did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I thought it was -- the paintings were just spectacular. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I absolu -- I’m blanking out on his name, he’s Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">But I thought they were all AIDS victims, turned out he had a brain tumor, and he’s alive and well, but they all look -- they really all look like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So -- But of all the things to spend money on, in the luxury category, I think art would be my -- top of my list.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  Were your parents collectors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Y -- I mean, in Europe they had a wonderful -- I remember lots of paintings, and they were supposed to have been good paintings, but they never came out, and I have -- I don’t really even know who they were, or how valuable they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">That was not something they continued to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They have a couple of Hungarian painters, that were very well known in the Hungarian circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Freid -- I don’t know if you ever heard of- kind of impressionists, faux impressionists, but they were, you know, very good friends, and actually I tried to talk my mother once, to buy a Chagall lithograph, and I think she was sorry she didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But no, not here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  Well you have so-some really interesting pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And you’re not afraid of collecting German artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  That’s -- It’s -- It’s interesting, that was the only one that’s definitely German, and I had mixed feelings about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And the other -- the one that they’re really famous for, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">water tanks</span> , that’s -- it’s -- 1t’s fu -- a very good friend of mine, who I went to a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> with, are major collectors, I mean really major, and she’s also an art dealer, and I’ve gone with her a few times, and bought things, you know, through her and with her, and I think somebody had bought this, and they couldn’t pay the last payment, or something, and she- she said, you know, if I don’t buy this, I’m crazy, and it was really a good buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I liked it, and I -- I don’t even think I was paying attention to the German part, to tell you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">If I had, I probably wouldn’t have bought it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  You want to explain for the tape, what we’re talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  Yeah, this 1s a series of nine photographs taken -- what these -- it’s a husband and wife, Bescher. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I can’t think of their first name, Hannah, and -- I can’t think of his name, Bescher, but they’re probably one of the most predominant photographers, and they take multiple shots of the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">They’re very well known for their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">water tanks</span> , and these are <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and it’s -- they’re no -- I mean, they’re sold as a unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">There are nine, aren’t there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And they’re kind of hung as a series.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  Yeah, cause after you were talking about, you know, nothing German --
ANSWER:  I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  -- and I’m sitting here looking at those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Yeah, 1-1-it’s funny, you’re absolutely right, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">QUESTION:  But then, most people wouldn’t know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">No, but it’s not because most people, I mean, like the bag I didn’t buy, I didn’t buy not because anybody would have known it, but I mean, I have turned like dishes or things upside down to look, so I don’t know how this kind of major thing snuck in, but it certainly did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  When you were married both times, were they religious ceremonies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">ANSWER:  Yes, both times. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I’ve been married by a rabbi, does that mean -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">First time it was at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Hampshire House</span> , by a rabbi, actually a Hungarian rabbi, who had come here after the war, and had his congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And he used to tutor my mother and her brother, to earn extra money, to go through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And the second time we were married at <span class="BUILDING">Temple Emmanuel</span> , in the study, of my rabbi, and my husband’s rabbi, who happened to have been classmates, so they were good friends, and it just worked out well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  This was 1m-important to you, to be married by a rabbi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  You know, it’s another one of those things I just didn’t think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I mean, I -- I don’t know, it just -- I didn’t even think about who else could marry you, like a Justice of the Peace, I -- yeah, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I mean, if I answered you, 1t wouldn’t really be -- I just didn’t think about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  You’ve talked -- Several times you’ve mentioned the Hidden Children gathering.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  It sounds like that was kind of a focal point for you, kind of coming out as a survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Somebody said that, it’s like coming out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I think what happened, and I don’t know how accurate this 1s, but I think the period of assimilation had passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I assimilated, I grew up, I was an American teenager, I was married, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">It is now at the point in time, where with my generation, it’s all over, except these tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I didn’t think about that 20 or 30 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I wanted to go on with my life, and my parents wanted to go on with their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I mean, we were all very happy to be here, and still today, when people criticize this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , my <span class="REGION">European side</span> comes out, and I always want to say, go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">If you don’t like it here, go wherever it’s better. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Cause with all the problems here, with all the horrible things, what -- whether it’s -- from the politicians and the -- the crookedness, and th -- all that, I’d still rather live here than anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And we had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And I don’t like the American flag being burned, I don’t like this freedom of choice business. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I don’t mean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of choice of doing things that I -- I don’t think the right thing to do, because I don’t think you have to burn anything to make a statement, but that’s my own opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But I am very conscious of the fact that historically, I wouldn’t like it not to be remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Not me, because I’ve been very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">A tremen -- All of my aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I have one cousin, who’s 77, who’s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">He’s married, he has a son, a nice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And he’s assimilated, totally, sometimes excessively, and it’s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his Auschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn’t ready to part with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">On the other hand, he lived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging 1n their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">So -- And he also went overboard joining -- I probably shouldn’t say this on tape, case he listens to it -- a very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I wouldn’t deal too well with that, if I’m not welcome, it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I mean, it’s not okay, but I wouldn’t want to make a statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But that’s how he’s dealt with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">He’s got his own demons, probably much worse than mine, cause his mother died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">So, you can’t really be critical of what other people, you know, do, and how people deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">But I think -- Well first of all, this Hidden Children thing just happened, so --
QUESTION:  Yeah, when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">ANSWER:  I guess about five years ago, and there was an article in a New York magazine, and it was getting a lot of publicity, it was going to be like maybe a couple of hundred people or something, were going to gather at the <span class="BUILDING">Marriott Marquis Hotel</span> , and my daughter called me and told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And she said, how come I’m not going? </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I said, “Well, I really hadn’t thought about it, what am I going to do there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And it was Memorial Day weekend, and we were invited out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamptons</span> , which sounded like a much better thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you know, I think I’m going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And I said to my husband, “Let’s go out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamptons</span> , and I’Il come back for the one day out of the two, and you stay, and that’s that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Well, he came back with me, and I only went for one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And I went early in the morning, and by lunchtime I called him, and I said, “Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Elie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,” and you know, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And it was really a very interesting experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And one of my friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying the war was wonderful, and I had a lovely childho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some things that weren’t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn’t even aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">So I guess, you know, something is definitely there, and I -- I don’t know if it’s my personality or what, that likes to think the glass is half full, as opposed to half empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">But it is definitely important that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">We went to the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Beach</span> , which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people have said an awful lot of money is going to all these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and all of this stuff, you know, isn’t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">But I think the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you hear about all these shootings at <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and stuff, it’s a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But I’m not sure that it’s -- goes to the right people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">You know, it’s -- I remember years ago, having meetings, and chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But the people that were there, were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">The people that were that late, didn’t hear my complaining, so I’m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , listen to these tapes, and say, “Well, you know, we did terrible things to these people, maybe we won’t do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">QUESTION:  Change tape aga -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape three, side A, <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> interview with Eva Cooper, on Tuesday, June 22", 1999. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Did you always talk to your daughter about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">ANSWER:  She claims I didn’t in the beginning, and it’s really interesting, cause that’s something that’s come up a lot at these Hidden Children meetings, about some daughters who said their parents talked too much, and other daughters who said their parents didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I didn’t for a long time, and she teases me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I had all these pictures, after the war, that were taken, and I don’t know why, but it was just sort of something that came up from time to time, and I always told her that when she was older, I would show it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">There were all these dead bodies, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that were being shoveled up to be buried 1- in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , cause they couldn’t be identified, and -- and there were just a lot of bodies all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that -- when we came back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , cause we were in hiding <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and so I remember all these bodies and stuff, and shortly after we came back, they were hanging people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And you know, this -- these were all documented, and no, I didn’t want to show her the pictures, for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I’m not sure whether they were upsetting for me, or whether I thought that she’d be upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I did take her to a couple of movies, when she was like a young teenager, that were, I guess I thought age appropriate, and that she could handle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And it’s interesting, because my -- I’ve changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">You know, now I feel if the people that were victims could handle it, you know, children should be able to handle it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I certainly started younger with my grandson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I don’t -- you know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I guess timing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">With my grandson, I was at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , waiting for somebody, and he put out his right hand like Heil, Hitler, and it really freaked me out, totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And so -- I mean, he was little, maybe four, five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So I kind of kneeled -- you know, bent down, at his level, I said, “Adam, why did you do that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And he said, “Well, I just had seen that in “The Sound of Music.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So I said, “Well, yeah, that’s what they did,” I said, “but I have to tell you a story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And I said, “If you remember the story, some of those soldiers were the bad guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And this was this guy, Adolf,” anyhow, and I said, you know, “I don’t really want you to do that, that’s not a salute that 1s appropriate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I don’t know what words I used, I was really kind of emotional about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So then he said, “Will you tell me other stories about what happened to you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And I did, and actually at the Hidden Children, there was some wonderful books, and I had gotten some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And I read some to him, and then, subsequently he, you know, read “Anne Frank” and all the other Holocaust related stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">But now, it’s become like a joke, every time I give him a book, I say, “No, it’s not about the Holocaust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">QUESTION:  And what’s your relationship to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">ANSWER:  That’s an interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I’m very glad it’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">I wouldn’t want to live there, and it has nothing -- it has -- I was going to say it has nothing to do with me, but that’s not quite right, that’s a flip answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I’m not as committed to it being my homeland as some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I think we’re very lucky, as American Jews, that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is there, it’s -- to lean on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">But it’s not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> I want to live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I don’t feel that because I’m Jewish, I have to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">It’s not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , certainly, my parents chose, like a lot of people after the war, that -- I don’t -- I don’t think of it in terms of my homeland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Maybe I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Maybe that’s where all the Jews belong, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I mean, we were perfectly happy being Hungarian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Did you ever see a movie called, “Ship of Fools’? </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">He said, “After all, I’m a German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Well, right now I’m saying, “After all, ’'m an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Could it happen here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  Do you feel at this point, that it’s important to talk about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  To talk about --

not sure whether I shouldn’t have just had them put it back, you know, on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pews</span> , or what they had planned to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">But when they had them in the back, and they said, “Would you like them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I said, “Yes, I would.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">So that was quite moving, and Adam was quite impressed, moved, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And we bought some Judaica there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">So --
