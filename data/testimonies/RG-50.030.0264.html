<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  It was the most wonderful life that a child could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We had a very warm family. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Subsequent to our moving, my mother, who had many brothers and sisters, they all moved to The Hauge and my...her parents moved there as well, and we just had the most wonderful life that anybody can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I grew up in a warm family. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We were Orthodox at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like...there was no reform Judaism to speak of in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There was no conservative Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were all Orthodox, and they really raised us more Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I have two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The three of us were raised more Orthodox that they themselves were because they had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Their business was always open on...on the Sabbath day...on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  That was the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And but they made us go to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> for 8 years, 10 hours a week, and that was an hour before my regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and an hour after the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And we had the most wonderful life that any child could grow up with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  How about...what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  I went first to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , and after <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> you take an examination if you want to connect up with <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , with the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that connects with the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I took the examination and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">lycee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">girl's lycee</span> and it's...it's 1t was a really very, very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">all the lycees, all the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> teached the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And then when you're finished it...I would stay that it is a combination of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> combined because after that you go straight into <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and into <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  And you already started the lycee?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Were there any...any premoditory signs of difficulty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My parents believed that the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> was going to stay neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We had some friends who begged us to come to the Southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> be...after Hitler invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">My father thought now the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> was neutral during the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It would certainly remain neutral in the second World War since Hitler probably needed a neutral country in...in that part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">my father never believed that the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> would be invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I...I don't think...I've never...I never met up with any anti-Semitism in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> even though there was no separation of <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and state, there was never any interference from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> into this...into the school system that I attended or that any of my friends ever attended. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We never had any education in religion, any kind of religion, and it was up to the individual to to supplement their religious training elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Do you remember the day the Nazis marched in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  I certainly do. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">the...the radio announced that we better stay in the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> and we all...we slept the whole night during the four days of war, we slept in the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">After we at...at one point, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> was bombed and we all thought it was The Hague because it is only about 30 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> and we were convinced that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But when the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> capitulated, we were all afraid to come out of that <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And the first German I saw that was some experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I was very, very freightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  The Germans marched in with song. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They sang their Nazi army songs and they marched through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and then, of course, we encountered individuals...Germans marching walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">In the beginning, they were very subdued. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They did not bother people individually except the first major...uh..thing that happened is that they wrote in the newspaper and announced on the radio that all the citizens of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> have to come to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> for identification papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And if you were Jewish you have to tell that because they knew who was Jewish because they got all the lists from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , and if you did not tell them you would be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concenration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And that was the first I heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So we were aware that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> because every time they wanted us something to do, we were threatened with being sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> if we didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and we got an identification paper and it had a J on it and that was the beginning of the end because there they had us. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">No matter what we...what happened afterwards, there was nothing we could do because we had that identification card with the J on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And after they .the...the very first months were after the identification card were quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Then the edicts came, and we read about it in the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Every time there was something new, a law against the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">First of all they told us we could not go into the <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That was forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Jewish people could not go into <span class="DLF">parks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And it became increasingly worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We could not travel by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In other words, we could not leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We could not use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We could not use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , and to make matters, we had to deliver our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Now our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> were our <span class="DLF">life line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It's like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So we were virtually shut off from everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Wherever we went we had to travel...we had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So matters go worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We...and we read about the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Then, of course one day there was a edict that we had to leave...all the Jewish children had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and
QUESTION:  How old were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">A; I was 15 when the Germans marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">By the time I left the <span class="BUILDING">lycee</span> ...when I was forced to leave the <span class="BUILDING">lycee</span> , I was at that time...it was Dec...1t was about December 41, about December 41 or it could have been November. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then the Jewish teachers who were also forced out of their jobs, they organized a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> or lycee for the children who were on that level. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So I did attend that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">One morning we read in the newspaper that all the Jewish people had to come to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and to collect their stars that we all had to wear a star, and it had to be sewn on without any spaces in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">If they could put their finger through it, we were going to be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I stilll remember my mother sewing and sewing and sewing all night long all those stars that she collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the Jewish sense of humor prevailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">One of the kids wrote on the board, "Tomorrow morning, come an half an hour early. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We are going to have a star parade.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We sort of tried to make fun out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I uh one of the edicts was that we could only go grocery shopping between 3 and 5 in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Now there was already very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Some of the merchants tried to put food away for the...for their Jewish customers under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> so that we had some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Uh and there were...it seemed that every time there was something else that we had to adhere to. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We could, for instance, one evening we were told we could only walk behind each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We could not walk next to each other anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So when I was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> walking with my mother, I had to walk behind her. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My sister had to walk behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My other sister had to walk behind her. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So that's the way we all walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">December of 40 it was Pearl Harbor Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We didn't know it was Pearl Harbor Day, but it was December 7 and we were not allowed to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> anymore after 6 in the evening and the other...the non-Jewish people I believe could be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> till 8. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So when you heard a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , you always knew it was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So it was very freightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But one evening it was December the 7th, my father had a coronary in the middle of the night, and Jewish doctors could not practice medicine anymore, and non-Jewish doctors could not attend to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My mother sent...we had a telephone near my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but she didn't want to alarm him and she told me I had to go downstairs into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where there was another telephone and to call somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And there was always a number in the newspaper, a medical number to call. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Now I had to go with a flashlight because the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was not black, there was no blackout in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and you could...were not allowed to put any lights on. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So I went there with a flashlight looking for the newspaper and looking for a number and finally I called the number and they said, " What religion do you have?" </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I said, "We are Jewish.‚Äù "</span><span class="sentence" id="144">Sorry, we can't come.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They did come hours later to declare him dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And one of the bad things that, of course, we...we were besides ourselves because he was not an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He was only 53 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And he left my mother who was in her 40s with three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">was engaged, or she was going with a son of their best friends, and they did want them to leave earlier because the men were already being picked up at that...in the...near 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So they were they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They had married before my father passed away and they were hiding in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere till they found a way to escape which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They escaped before we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And one of the bad things was that my father died without a will and his bank account was closed right away which left my mother almost indigent. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> had been confiscated before...and the day they were confiscated the Germans came in and beat up my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Did he also own the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  My father owned the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My father owned one <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and two <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> were rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But they came into the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They beat him up, and some of the people who worked for him brought him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he was bleeding from his nose and from his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But he recuperated. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Was nothing serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And but, of course, we lost him in December of 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">My mother stilll had the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She had always been very active in business and so she knew exactly how to handle it, and she knew she had to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She was not going to let anything happen to her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">She was a very dynamic person and she knew that she was going to do everything for us not to have to through a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> because somehow people say they didn't know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We did know about it because every threat was if you don't do this, you are going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So we knew there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We didn't know where, but we knew there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And at one point my uncle, one of my uncles came and to tell us goodbye, and my mother said, "Where are you going.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He said, "I am going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> ," which was a...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was a way Station before you were sent to the bad <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the eastern part of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">My...my mother said, "Are you crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Why...why are you going.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He said, "If I do what the Germans tell me to do, they are not going to do me any harm.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My mother said, "You're crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Don't go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="179">One thing I do want to bring out that 80 percent and I don't thing this is known...80 percent of the Jewish Dutch population were blue collar workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were poor people, and to get out and escape cost a lot of money because most people escaped with the help of passeur, and they charged tremendous amounts of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And my mother was working in that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> day and night to make enough money for us to get out and to pay a passeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">To make a long story short, 1t was the most freightening time. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">From December to July was very, very freightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">All the telephones were censored. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">All the newspapers were censored. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In the morning we would call friends to see if they were stilll there because during the night they came and picked us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And we never knew who was stilll there and who was already picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My...and my mother was working against time to make the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Now we had about 20 friends who all decided they wanted to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and try to escape rather than to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They got a passeur together and it was decided that on July the 14, 1942, we would be going and try our escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We never knew if the 20 were going to be all there because of the of the nights where the people were being picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">As it happened, we were all there July the 14th. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We lived in a totally <span class="DLF">Catholic street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">My mother had confided to one family that we were going to try to leave the following day, and they had seven children. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They made all the children go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that morning to pray for the welfare of all the Jewish people and especially for their neighbors, the family Pajgin, but they never told them why although the parents knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And we took the star off our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We put on two dresses on top of each other and we had nothing else and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was the day of my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">My mother felt terrible that she couldn't make me a really nice birthday party, which she had always done. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And she got up at 5 o'clock in the morning...that morning and she went to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and boughtt me some hugh peaches, and that was my birthday present and I ate those for breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Of course, we took our life into our hands because we...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were spot checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I did not take my identification card with us and neither did my...I left with my mother and my younger sister who was...at that time she was 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I had borrowed from a girlfriend of mine an identification card without a J on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">She had given it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We didn't look at all alike. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Her picture was...she was blond, and I had black hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But she gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">She wanted me to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Fortunately, we were never checked on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we were supposed to go to a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brada</span> which was near the <span class="DLF">Belgium border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">When we got there and we were going to meet all 20 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We did leave...that time we left in the day time. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And at night there were about something like 17 who who made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Three of them were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We don't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I had I should have taken that card that my girlfriend had given me and torn it up and she should have claimed that she had lost 1t. One of the young men on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...1n the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> the next day, and I told him, "Would you take this card and give it to my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Give it back to her.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He said, "Sure.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="220">As it happened, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was being checked, and he became flustered and they took him off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and searched him and found that card. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">The first thing that they did they went to my girlfriend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they put her in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and he sort of confessed that he had gotten the card from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">He was very, very nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And they put her in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And she was kept there for a whole week, and the only reason why she was let out was she kept insisting that I had stolen it from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">She never said she had given it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">What happened to the young man I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">He was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> next to hers and she told me later that he was being beaten every single day and she heard him scream but otherwise I don't know what happen to the family his family or to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Now we stayed a few days at that <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and the the passeur who my mother had paid to bring us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> he would cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> and see if it was safe for us to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And one night he said it was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So we left in groups of...I only can remember that I left with my mother and my younger sister, and then other...the other people would leave at a different hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We walked across the <span class="DLF">border</span> in the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We went through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We...we were a mess when we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We did go from the <span class="DLF">border</span> on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and the passeur had all...arranged all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and we stayed in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We could not leave his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for about...about a week because the Germans were checking identification cards after we had arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">This...during this whole trip we were so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The luck was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">If it was unlucky that I had to leave my wonderful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , there was something that was so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We...we were never checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We were never...we were...we just were never caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And to..to tell you that of the 20 people, we...we were the only three who were not caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Everyone else was caught at different stages. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Even if you know in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the other, they know exactly where you come from because your accent 1s different. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Here you have greater <span class="REGION">territory</span> so this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and people maybe will not so readily recognize what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> you come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">There even if I go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> today, people say, "I know you're from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But so when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> even though they spoke "Flamish," we could not speak to anybody because they would know we were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But we stayed for a week in my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he arranged to find us a passeur to take us to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We knew we wanted to eventually go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We did not want to stay in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but my uncle got this passeur for us, and he was going to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">My paid him ahead of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I understand...my mother told me later...that the whole journey to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> cost her something like 60,000 dollars...the equivalent of 60,000, which was a fortune 1n those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And she made it all after my father passed away in that <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And that is a long story how she made it, and I am not going to go into that nght now. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But when we left with the passeur to go back to go to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">In the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , he left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">He had received his money and he left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And we knew nobody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">My mother approached somebody on the <span class="DLF">street</span> who wore a star, the Jewish star, and just took her life in her hands and told him the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">He took us to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of his <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> for about I would say 4 or 5 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And this man was absolutely a Godsend. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He found us another person to take us to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The whole story was just plain luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was not brain power. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I do have to give my mother credit for all this because with her she never took no for an answer as I said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We...my sisters and I have often spoken to...1f God forbid my Mother would have passed away and my Father would have lived, we would never have gotten out of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , because my father became very depressed from the whole situation and he didn't see a way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">My mother was always the optimist and she knew we were going to be...uh..going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">She was not going to go just lying down for...for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Now this...the next passeur who took us out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We...we did some walking over...we went...we circumvented <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Douai</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lille</span> on the western side of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , northwestern side of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and then we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="DLF">Demarcation Line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">It was scary because we saw the Germans on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">railroad stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But nobody ever checked our papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">As a matter of fact, we had no paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We were there as non-entities. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And when we crossed the <span class="DLF">Demarcation Line</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dijon</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> , we sighed a sigh of relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We thought we had it made. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We did go to the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> , the Dutch Consul, and asked for papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The Dutch Consul said, "What is your religion.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="285">My mother told him, "We are protestants.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="286">My...So the Counsul said, "Why did you leave.‚Äù‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And my mother made up a wonderful story that her daughter who was 18 years old, namely I was followed by a German soldier...soldier and that she feared for my safety and that's why we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We changed our name from Pajgin to Pogan because my older sister who had preceded us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> had told the Dutch Consul that she was Jewish and so we had to change our name a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Our being Protestant...so called Protestant saved our life in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because _had made an arrangement with Hitler to send all the Jewish refugees back to <span class="REGION">occupied territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They came to search our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we stayed every single night for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I remember them looking under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They looked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cupboards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They looked everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And this went on every single night. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">When they saw that our papers had "Protestant," they excused themselves for waking us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">As long as I live, I will never forget the screams of the Jewish people who were taken out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">This <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It had a circular <span class="DLF">stairway</span> in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So I don't remember that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , but all these people were taken down from their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on that circular <span class="DLF">stairway</span> which passed our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">The screams of those people I will never forget as long as I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We were spared because we were Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Now we had heard that the Germans were trying to march into the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we were trying to march into the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And we were trying to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> would not let anybody 1n if you didn't have papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">If you made it beyond 20 feet of the <span class="DLF">border</span> and they caught you, you were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They would not send you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But many people lost their lives over the...on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">There was already....this was...we arrived 1n in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We left the 14th of July, 42 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We left about...we arrived in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> about a month later. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It took us about a month to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And by the time my mother very seriously thought that we should leave, that was already September, and there was a lot of snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and everybody said, "You cannot risk your life on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">You cannot go that way.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So we went back to the Dutch Consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He said, "Now if you can get a transit visa through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , you can go to <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surinam</span> as it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Now I persuaded the policeman that he should give me a _ which was a permit to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Consulate</span> there and try to get a transit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I went there and...I went with my brother-in-law, my older sister's husband, and there was no problem getting a...a....a transit visa for my mother, for my two sisters, and for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They would not give it to my brother-in-law because Hitler had made a pact with with Franco that no military age person would go through because they knew they would join the Allied Armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So my brother-in-law couldn't get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We tried and tried and tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They wouldn't give it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I tried my best. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I flirted with these Spanish people in that consultate which my mother had told me to do...and I did...but it was to no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We even tried to change my brother-in-law's age on his passport with some ink iradicator, but it was so bad it made a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">My brother-in-law stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">My mother kept calling and said, "You must come. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The Germans are about to march in.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="331">My mother, my younger sister and I, we went to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Papinyon</span> and we...I left my brother-in-law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">My mother had left my brother-in-law quite a bit of money to see if he couldn't buy himself a transit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">When we arrived across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , there was a lot of cheering and I think it was November the 10, 1942, when we arrived across the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And all the Spainards were cheering. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And there was a Dutch representative from the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> at this <span class="BUILDING">station</span> who apparently came and met many of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to see if there were any Dutch people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And I asked him...I couldn't understand Spanish...and I asked him why are they all cheering. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The Consul said, "Don't you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">This is the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that is coming out of the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The...the Germans have invaded and taken over the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So, of course, we felt good that we were out, but my brother-in-law was stilll back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> , and my sister...my oldest sister was at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">She had preceded us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> because my mother thought maybe she could do something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> to get her husband a transit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I said to my sister, "How did you know that we were here, that we were on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And she said, "I know I have met every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that came from the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and I am so happy to see you because I know I will never see Bob again.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Now about that evening, we received a phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> received a phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> that my brother-in-law had made it safely out. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The Germans marched into the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on May the 8th, and they came...they came from the north and they marched down through the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">By the time they had...they hadn't reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> yet, but they were well on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">My brother-in-law went back to the Spanish consul and said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The Germans are about here. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Why don't you give me a visa and I give you all this money.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And they took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And he couldn't get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out any more to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He made it to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> and he walked a lot of pyranees...there was a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , and somehow from there, he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Going without a visa woud have been the same as death because in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> they put all the people who did not have a transit visa or a visa, they put them in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We knew of one that was called Miranda and the situation was so bad that few people survived that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They did not give them any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They...the people were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">It was the worst and worse situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">As a matter of fact, there were two friends of my parents who had landed in that camp and who had never come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Now we stayed about 4 days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> where the Dutch government in... Dutch government was in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at the time and they had arranged for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to pick all the Dutch people up and bring them to Dutch Guyana Surinam. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> for few weeks, and we were about 75 Dutch people. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We were put on this neutral Portugese <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surinam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was...I think 1t was something like a 3 week journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was only that because it was a neutral <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We passed all the dark <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that were they were either <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ships</span> or and they were black...black out. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">About a day and a half before we got to the harbor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paranami Surinam</span> , we we could not go with the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was too large for the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And we were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch ship</span> that was considerably smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Everyone got seasick again because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was shaking so badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> for about this was the middle of the night that we were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Portugese ship</span> onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch ship</span> and about 3 hours after we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was stopped by a German U-boat and some German soldiers came on board and at random took two of our Dutch people off. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They just took two off. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">There was no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They was just being vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And...

QUESTION:  You were at the point where you were on the...
ANSWER:  Where we were in <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Where they took off the two Dutch people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The two Dutch people were taken off this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paramia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I remember it was morning and they played Dutch National Athem for us when we arrived, and everybody was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We were very emotional when we heard that because many of us never thought we would ever hear it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The Governor of that <span class="COUNTRY">Dutch Guyana</span> was at that time a man by the name of Mr. Kilstra. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">He was not very keen on having 75 Jewish people come, which was unusual, because the Dutch people had always been very good to their Jewish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And we had never felt any anti-Semitizm in the...while we lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But he was not very happy, and he had built what he called a <span class="BUILDING">refugee house</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The <span class="BUILDING">refugee house</span> was a hugh camp with barbed wire around it, and we were not allowed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for 6 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We...all the women were put in one great big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cots</span> , and all the men were sleeping in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They separated married couples, some of them for about a year because my mother was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I was in there 5 months because a family had asked my mother if they could have my younger sister and myself live with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And my mother...mother consented to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So we were 6 months in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We were made to do kitchen work which was unusual in a <span class="REGION">tropical country</span> at that time because...not that there was anything wrong with doing kitchen work, but at that point the Governor made us do it because it was degrading. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">White people did not do any kitchen work at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Nobody minded all that much, but it was just a sign how he was trying to degrade us. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">We as I said...I came out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> after 6 months and lived with a school teacher and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The Dutch government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> arranged for me to have private lessons because I had | more year to go to finish my lycee education and which after I would have finished that education I could have entered graduate work in a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I got private lessons for about...uh..6 months and then the government, the Dutch government in exile set up an examination in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , sent it to the Minister of Education in <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana</span> and I took it in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and was very happy that I passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The reason why I had to take private lessons because they did not have a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there that was on the same level as a lycee. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">They had lower level <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">After that I worked for a year with the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch customs office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parimiabol</span> , and I was then asked by the <span class="BUILDING">Netherlands Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , would I come to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">My mother was very much opposed to it and at prior time I had wanted to train as a nurse and go with the Dutch with the Allied Army into the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> with the occupation forces and to be trained in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but my mother would not give permission be...and I had to have her permission because I wasn't 21 yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And at that time she had said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">If you wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that would be something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">At least you would be 1n a safe <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but I do not want you training in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And she did not want me to go with the occupation forces as a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I did she did give the consent and I did leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> I was connected with the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch Embassy</span> there for...for 2 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It..1t was a difficult period. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I came withi 40 dollars in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I had no clothes to speak of. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Some seamstress in <span class="COUNTRY">Dutch Guyana</span> had made me some so-called gorgeous dresses, and when I arrived I looked absolutely hideous. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">My salary was not very high, but I made ends meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I lived in a <span class="BUILDING">girl's hotel</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Meridian Hill Hotel</span> on <span class="DLF">16th Street</span> , which was at that time across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I did slowly get to know some Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I could not speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I had had 1 year of English and when the Germans marched in, they did away with all the English in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and increased my German courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I was...I had...when I was at the <span class="BUILDING">lycee</span> , I had 3 hours of German and 3 hours of English and 3 hours of French a week, and they increased it to 6 hours of German and no English. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So my German was quite good at the time, but my English was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">When I met some Americans it was interesting the advice I would receive from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">At that point I had hidden my Jewish identify for so long that I was actually afraid to tell people that I was Jewish, and I did not tell them either. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So they would ask me why did I leave the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , and I had the same story that the German soldier was running after me, conditions were very bad, and we left it at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They...the American people I met were all very kind and nice people and they had some very good advice as far as they were concerned for a 20 year old girl who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> all by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">One of the things they told me, and this was told to me at least 10 times by 10 different Americans, that this 1s a good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but I better watch out because there is a group of people I want to stay away from because they will cheat you and they will lie to you and I will be the worse of it if I believed and got in touch with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I asked them who are these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And they told me they are the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was flabbergasted that in a free democratic society they would just lump a whole group together and believe the lies that Hitler was trying to promote. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I did argue against them from which I thought was a point of strength because they didn't know I was Jewish and so maybe I thought I had more clout arguing with them from that point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But I was, of course, very insecure in my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I...uh..I had written to my mother that I...was no way I was going to stay in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because it was not democratic and it was very prejudiced against Jews and other minorities and that I absolutely could not live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Now at that time I did have a very poor point of view of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I had never studied American history. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I did not know much about the geography of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> the emphasis was on job. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I believe I learned more about the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> than I did about the United States of America there. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">You cannot appreciate a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> if you do not know the history of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I didn't know the history of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I felt that there was no democracy here. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">What changed all that I did get married, and I married a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">My husband came originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and he was...he was...when I met him, he was a resident in Surgery at <span class="BUILDING">Gallinger Hospital</span> which is now I understand the District of Columbia Hospital. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And he changed my whole way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  They want to change the tapes now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You were at the point where you were talking about your husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">You can go ahead with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  I met my husband in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , and he was a resident in surgery at that time <span class="BUILDING">Gallinger Hospital</span> which is the District of Columbia Hospital. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">He...he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">He had a very good knowledge of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the political system and the the the history of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">He has been the best teacher I've ever met in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He has been my teacher and my whole view on the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> has changed since I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">In the meantime, of course, I have taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">American history and I understand this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I know tt's flaws, but I...I think it's the best <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world with all it's shortcomings. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I have worked very hard through the political system to make it even a better <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which I feel very strongly is up to the individual and we have an opportunity here. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I have also become active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , and I have taught <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> in the past for 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I stilll study Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I am very proud to be Jewish and I'm the better for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I feel very comfortable with my religion and it's... give my husband all the credit because he is a very well balanced person and has contributed a great deal to my mental life. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I have two children in the mean...and I am very proud to say that they were able to partake of the best education this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has to offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">As a former immigrant to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I'm very proud to boast that my daughter is a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">Smith College</span> , and my son a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">Princeton University</span> which is sort of an highlight in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Now, of course, they have to prove themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">That was as much as my husband and I could do to educate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Now they are on their own, and I am proud to say they are very contributing American citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Uh I believe that you...you have a question on part of your life in <span class="COUNTRY">Dutch Guyana</span> ...is that what you...
QUESTION:  Well, at this point let's return to your life in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Would you tell us something about what you alluded to that your mother had a way of earning the money that got you out of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Would you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">My father had been very grateful that what started him so successfully economically in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> had been the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So even after he had acquired three <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> which were very successful, he never gave up the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I don't know if that was a superstition or what it was, but he felt that <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> had helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He was going to keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And that <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> eventually had much to do with saving our lives because when the money was all confiscated and we were left without a cent, the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> was bulging with merchandise because my father had thought the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> was going to stay neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And so he knew that if you have a lot of merchandise in a neutral little <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> at war all around you that it will be profitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So when my mother was left with bulging <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> of shoes, she decided the only way to do it was not an honorable way and she knew it, but she said this was the only way she could save her life and her children's life is to sell these shoes on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> which she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And she from about December till July made a fortune with those shoes, selling them on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> for tremendous prices. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And that's the way she made the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It's not an honorable way of making it, but I guess 1f you want to save your life you do a lot of things you really would not do under normal circumstances, and I know she was an honorable person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  How about the Catholic family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  The Catholic family I did go to see them my first trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">For years I was afraid to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I didn't have the money either. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But the first time I went was when my husband had a meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and our trip was paid for and we decided that we must include a trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I did go back to see the Catholic family who had been so nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And, of course, they had heard from my mother that we had made it to <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana</span> and they were delighted to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">There were others 1n the <span class="DLF">street</span> who were alerted that Miss Pajgin was back. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Liny Pajgin was back, and they all congregated in the little <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> this man owned, and they hugged and kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They wanted me to visit, but there wasn't much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But they were so happy and they all had stories to tell about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And they were only the best of stories because my father did have a good reputation in The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It was it was a small...for a American standards, a small Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">However, my father did a lot of charitable work. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">He was the one with one of a friend who organized a fund from which poor Jewish people could borrow money without paying interest, and he was known to...to have done a lot of good for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I remember on Friday afternoon my father would sometimes sit in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I swear all the beggars in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> would come for money for them for the Sabbath meal and when my father passed away, I that that the...that the majority of people who came were beggars who honored him for the last honor they could give him. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Women at that time were...did not go to <span class="BUILDING">funerals</span> , and we stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But I remember looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the whole <span class="DLF">street</span> was going behind my father's uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> and...and...and the whole <span class="DLF">street</span> was filled, and I had never seen most of these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  How did your mother get the gold out of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  The gold? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I I should...I've never mentioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">My...before we left, we went over to a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who let us bring the shoes we were going to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> he made holes and he put gold coins and diamonds that my mother owned in our shoes and we never took off our shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Even when we went to sleep at night, we never took the shoes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And that is the way we brought out some of the money that support us. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And I stilll have some of the Dutch coins that I had in my shoes at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">The Dutch government took over from the...our financial obligations after we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">The Dutch government paid for our <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel rooms</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I worked for maybe 2, 3 weeks at the Ligation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">They needed somebody who could speak Dutch and. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">but we never paid for...the Dutch government paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">After the war my Mother did have to repay them for the trip to <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana</span> , for our stay even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My mother did have to repay them. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">My mother and my older sister and my brother-in-law and my younger sister, they stayed in <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana</span> when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">My younger sister took my position at the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> after I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Two years I had stayed with the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> , and then she took my position. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My older sister and my brother-in-law, they came and my mother came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">My mother really urged us all to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">While we had a wonderful life in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , I am glad I didn't have to live there after the war because there was nobody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">My family was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">My friends were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It was a miserable life there, and it would have really been so difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I'm happy that I did not go back to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I am happy that I married a man who did not go through the Holocaust experience because he had a positive point of view and he wasn't marked by those terrible experiences because if you go through that and that escape and the fear, 1t never leaves you. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It never does. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I...I have to say that wearing the star and all the degrading aspects that what Hitler tried to impose up us never degraded us because we were very proud people, but it did...I think that at the time we weren't hurt by it as much as later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I think that it takes a few years before it sinks in and you really feel the impact of being thrown out of your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , being thrown out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because we just locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind us, and left everything, and it is a terrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I remember sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">Meridian Hill Hotel</span> and it was Christmas time and the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I was sitting alone in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Now I had never celebrated Christmas at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but it was such an awesome...such a terrible feeling that I had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It was a feeling...I had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I had no one to turn to. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I was here all by myself and I never felt sorry for myself because I felt so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Untill this day, I feel that I'm one of the lucky ones because I think that in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> something like...I'm not actually correct that we didn't have something like more than 130,000 Jews and I believe that close to 120,000 Jews were...were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So here I am one of 10,000 Jews who made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I am one of the 20 people who left with us, and I'm here to tell this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And it 1s...I cannot believe man's inhumanity towards man. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And when I ask American Jewish people, "Why do you go on a vacation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">How can you have a good time?" </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Many of them tell me, "I'm an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I have...don't have the feelings that you have.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I said, "But you know Hitler was not against Liny Pajgin. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Hitler was against all the Jewish people and all the minorities and all the people who didn't have blond hair and blue eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And if Hitler had won the war you wouldn't be alive today either. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And we have to fight against injustices towards any kind of people because as long as you're injust toward one, you're injust toward the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">It drags the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We cannot be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I have fought and made myself at many times very unpopular because people don't like to hear sad tales. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They like to hear happy tales. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And they don't want to hear about the Holocaust anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">They think they know it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And maybe the atrocities of the Holocaust are not as important as the history that allowed this Holocaust to happen and we have to work day and night that this doesn't happen again, that we never put ourselves in that position as a nation, that we don't go after one group of people, no matter who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I think that I have contributed and I hope that my staying alive has had a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">That's all I can say. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And I know for myself I have had the most wonderful life that anyone can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I only hope that many, many people will have as good a life as I have had and stilll have. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So I have and I have this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to thank for it because it has allowed me the freedom with many pitfalls, but it stilll has allowed me the freedom to be my own person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Well, I think that your account here is going to contribute a great deal to the cause that is so important for you and I thank you very much for this interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  I thank you for the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Did any other Gentilles besides the Catholic family help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Just the...the girl who was my classmade in the lycee who gave me her identification card. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And...and then there was one other young men whom I knew who tutored me for in a chemistry class. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">When I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish lycee</span> , I was behind in...a year of chemistry that I hadn't had, and he was already in <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">His name is Amile Meits. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was against the law of the Germans because Gentiles were not allowed to come to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> anymore and Jews were not allowed to visit Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And he came to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he tutored me in chemistry so that I would be up to par at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish lycee</span> , and he also tried to ship some of our belongings to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but they got totally lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">After the war, he wrote me a letter and he said that my love for helping the Jewish people was more than just helping you during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I married a Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And I...I do have to also tell you the lycee was not in in working very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I think it existed...I was in it for about 6 months and it never opened up again after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And one more thing I really I left out is that the day after we left that the whole <span class="DLF">street</span> was trembling because a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army truck</span> came by at night to pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And we beat them by one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Our whole trip was so incredulous because we beat the Germans by one day when we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We were never picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We found this wonderful family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> who helped us, and they probably are not there today anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Then we came to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">We weren't picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It was all pure luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I cannot...I think that if I heard somebody tell this story I wouldn't believe a word of it because it all was just so much luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  One minor point. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I think you mentioned that your mother after the war found the passeur who had taken the money from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And what happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  I hate to say it, but that man was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And he lived on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> as...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> where an uncle of mine lived who had escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and he stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> because they asked him to work for the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So he stayed there the whole war. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And my mother looked at the <span class="DLF">mailbox</span> and she saw this name, recognized it, and she went to his <span class="DLF">door</span> , and she said, "Who are...Do you remember me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And the man turned pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He said, "Yes, I remember you. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">How is your daughter, Liny?" </span><span class="sentence" id="609">He even remembered my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And then my mother said, "Do you know what you did to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Aren't you surprised we are alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="612">He said, "You poor woman, you are totally senile. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">You know people like you should not stay alive that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You are senile.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And he insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Now my mother was going to make something about it, and we discouraged her. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I don't know if it is right or wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I...I don't know what she could have done, but it would have eaten her heart out. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And money after you save your life isn't that important. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And we had enough to get by. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We...we were not waiting for that money. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And that was...that was blood money. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">That was not money that I would have ever enjoyed having. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So we discouraged her from going after him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">You have been a wonderful interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview </span>
