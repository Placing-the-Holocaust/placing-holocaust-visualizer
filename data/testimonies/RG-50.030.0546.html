<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  I was the only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My — I remember once I was being punished because early age on I was kind of looking around and I ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">Christian church</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There was music coming out of it and I went in and my poor mother was looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I ended up being punished, and my punishment was that my father took away my shoes, and my mother had to carry me. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And I was a little — kind of bad, so I said, this is really no punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I loved being carried by my mother, so my father got pretty angry [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So early age on I had a certain amount of independent spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And we moved, I think my parents moved there when they got married, so they didn’t have as many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I remember November 9, 2008 my mother kind of talking to me always about what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I was her little confidant, which continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Unfortunately, she died at age 28, so it was to — fora very short time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Both my father and mother came from very religious family, but I believe when they moved up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> , some of the religion was left a little behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And my father enjoyed playing cards, and I remember that causing some problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  He played chess and cards, and it wasn’t something what my mother was used to, so as a young girl I remember arguments about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  We always kept kosher, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And I don’t recall my — I didn’t recall that my mother was working, but my aunt, who survived, her aunt — my aunt is my father’s younger sister, her name is Ibby(ph) Steinberger(ph) now. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She remembers that when I was a baby, she came over to watch me while my mother went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But for some reason, I had no recollection of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My mother always dressed beautiful, and she was a very beautiful lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And we ended up moving because my father November 9, 2008 heard what was happening around him, and he was worried that in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , people know us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  And if we go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , we would have a better opportunity to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Even though most of the people didn’t believe it can happen where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It may happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but it won’t happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolozsvar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So my father went up and secured in a— a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and there was such a tremendous amount of shortage of — of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It must have been either I was four or five, I have no recollection of the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my father talked very little about my life before the war, after I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we moved up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and all of a sudden we had to share one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">apartment unit</span> with several families. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I remember that was a little difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And my mother’s father, who had long beard and payos, you know, the usual, sometimes he stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> my father lived, my mother, I, and occasionally my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And it was ov — you know, crowded, and there were some arguments about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I have very, very precious memories of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He always had real deep pockets and always some goodies for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He spoiled me whatever way he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And when the — the Nyilas(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came into power, I remember that once he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all beaten up, bloody, part of his payos being pulled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And after that November 9, 2008 I never seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He came to us, and he kind of — I don’t know where he went, but that was the last time I seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My father went to work as a printer, and my mother continued working as a — as a hat maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And when the war broke out, I happened to visit with my maternal grandmother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashnalt(ph</span> ), and they were — I was visiting with my grandmother and I have vivid recollection of that, that she was pre — baking challah, and the smell in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And all of a sudden they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they said the Jews are being collected in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my aunt, younger aunt, her name 1s also Ibby(ph), my mother’s younger sister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth, and she says, Eva, you are not — she didn’t call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) -- Havelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And when it gets dark, you will go to the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi’s house</span> , and they will send a message for your father to come and get you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Tashnalt(ph) is pretty much in the <span class="REGION">Transylvania section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So my grandmother left, and I was hiding in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And they usually kept the keys, I remember her locking up and pointing where she 1s putting the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I was ready to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> when a group of Gypsies appeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I pretended that my grandmother was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because they had s — they were telling stories the Gypsies steal young children, and I didn't wanted to be stolen by Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I pretended that my grandmother 1s in there, and I said, November 9, 2008 Grandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don’t leave me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Naturally, everything 1s in Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I said, just leave me alone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I felt like a sense of accomplishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I could fool the Gypsies, I’d be able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi’s house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
