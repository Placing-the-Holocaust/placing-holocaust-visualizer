<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  What kind of work did your father --worked on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">What did your father actually do?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Did you have a large extended family on both sides, on your mother and —
ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My mother had one sister who drowned as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">She was evacuated during the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Into a very nice <span class="REGION">estate</span> and the children’s companion or nurse was ill so there were four girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They were on their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They were told not to go near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> but they did into https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013 a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it capsized and two of the girls drowned, so there was little family on that side of my -. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My father had just the one brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My grand, my paternal grandfather came from a larger family and he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was much more educated in religion than the other side of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">As I said the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was very, very assimilated.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Tell me about your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">You said you were an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And your mother had converted so were you raised Jewishly in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Marginally. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I always thought of Hitler as having, having made Jews more Jewish again. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But I mean I do remember the Seders at my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mother always lit Friday night candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My, as a matter of fact an old family friend would always say my mother was more Jewish than most of her Jewish relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My father always made Kiddush and I wish I had the sense to record it because he had a beautiful voice and did a wonderful, wonderful job. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So this was a routine Friday night affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Did your family belong to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">As a matter of fact, my grandfather was very active in his <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He was responsible for initiating a youth service. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I remember Simchas Torah and packaging up little bags of candy and nuts for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He was really quite active. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">However, in those days they still had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The maid would be sent to the butcher to buy the ham so yes and no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Tell me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> that you lived in? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013
ANSWER:  As a matter of fact <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pankow</span> really wasn’t but we moved away from there when I was about seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">However, later I found out that there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> and apparently quite a number of Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pankow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But at the time I wasn’t aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I was one of two Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And that brought up kind of interesting things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Such as.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Well we had to bring a coin to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to go and see a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And my parents kind of thought it would be one of the Grimm ’s fairy tales. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It was the story of was it Horst Wessel [ph] and the conflict between the Nazis and communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my parents were kind of horrified afterwards when I told them about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  How old were you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Probably seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  So you were still living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pankow</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  And why did your parents move when you were seven?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I guess I must have been eight or nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Oh for one thing 1t was an economic move because that was the time of, you had the depression here and my mother as a matter of fact, took work. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She worked at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">She was a fabulous dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In those days you know you had to go as a, what did they call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">To learn the trade and she worked for —
QUESTION:  An apprentice you mean, she was an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013
ANSWER:  No well, when, when we lived, after we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pankow</span> , when things got tough, she brought work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember her doing hand beading on gowns. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Always a white napkin on her lap to make it easier to --. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And always just before sunset or there would be an hour for her to play with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">That was our hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I think that was the primary reason why we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">As a matter of fact my last few months in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , I traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> back maybe three or four stops so I wouldn’t have to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It wasn’t worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was the last year of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  You mean when you moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And tell me again where you moved to from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pankow</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  But you continued to go back to your old <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is what you’re saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yes and in retrospect I realize my parents, I was relatively safe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I guess they didn’t want to move me for a few months into a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , not knowing what the situation would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Hitler was in power already.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I guess it was my seventh birthday when we were waiting for my closest friend to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">In those days the mothers came also to the birthday parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And one mother took my mother aside and said Mrs. Friedlander I don’t think Mrs. Meyer will come because you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And that was my first awareness, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  What did it mean to a young child to hear that? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Do you have any memory of your feelings? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013
ANSWER:  I think the shock that my closest friend wouldn’t come to my birthday party. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You know from that time on, I grew up quite quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We all did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Just in those beginning years, in 33, 34, did you have any other incidences like that, any other experiences?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  What about at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Was there any anti-Semitic experiences there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That’s exactly why my parents chose to have me go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> for the last few months, to keep me at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because there was no overt anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Was it a <span class="BUILDING">coed school</span> or just girls?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I do remember though in the morning when the teacher came in, you greeted her with Heil Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  But of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013

ANSWER:  I think I didn’t even know what it was all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Your parents didn’t say anything about that to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  How would you describe yourself as a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Were you independent or you were, I know you were quite young obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Over protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Sort of easily scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But otherwise, otherwise quite normal I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Did you like sports? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Did you do any kind of sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Very reluctantly as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My father enrolled me in the Jewish sports race Bar Kochba, but this was quite a bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I was not great on sports.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  And play and there was no problem with their parents, except for that other, the birthday party incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013
ANSWER:  That was the only incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  I assume you spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yes, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Hitler comes into power in 33 and you said things started to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And then you moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  But you went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And then did you notice anything in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , any changes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> once you moved there and Hitler was getting stronger and stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Any restrictions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Well now wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I have to change that a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I do remember actually repetitive dreams about the Hitler parades at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">As, in my dream as I was going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in the <span class="DLF">street</span> parallel to where I was, there was a parade with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and torch lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And that dream occurred a number of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So that I’m still very, very much aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I remember as though it was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And the discomfort until I got into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> used to be locked at 8:00 so I always had to be sure that I made it before eight because I didn’t have a key for the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So there was, I guess there was fear in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And the other thing I do remember and that was really when we moved into the second <span class="BUILDING">building</span> -- was the large swastika flags out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And to this day I have a dislike for putting flags out. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It’s, it must stem from that , why I feel that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  What did the symbol of the swastika mean to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Did it have any special meaning? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">https://collections.ushmm.org February 7, 2013
ANSWER:  Oh, hate and fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The interesting thing was that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> people who looked slightly Jewish or a very dark complexion would generally wear a swastika button in their suits, just to make sure that nobody —
QUESTION:  Would misconstrue that they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Did you ever see Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  But you, as you say the parades you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Yes, the parades, the constant parades. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They were always at night and always with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  You’re traveling by yourself to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then the next change was what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  The next change was my grandfather dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He had been in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , was supposed to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the following day and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Now I, what I remember was it supposedly was some bladder problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I assume it was prostate cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But in those days I didn’t even know they existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And as I say, I was always shielded and I was not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">My father belonged to a rowing club and I was spending the summer there, I suppose because we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And I never was brought back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Again you know they shielded children from such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  What was your grandfather’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Julius.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  Julius Friedlander right?</span></p>

QUESTION:  It’ll come to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Probably not because he was just “oopy” you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> itself, besides the parades, did you experience any anti-Semitic incidents? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And seeing the flags you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  You know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was the capital and it had definite advantages for us Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">In smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> everybody know exactly who the Jew was. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">There was, well until Kristallnacht for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">There wasn’t that much overt stuff going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Don’t forget we had the, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> had the Olympic games too. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I remember what —
QUESTION:  Do you remember that, those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Yes, I do remember it because I know one evening my mother’s father took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">This was before the Games started, to look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">To look at the —

<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  What about the book burning? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Were you aware of that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  Yes, so in other words I, when I finished actually my course in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> because I was an enemy alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I was lucky because most of the people there would be sent to <span class="NPIP">places</span> that manufactured gun powder and because I was an enemy alien, I went to a

said they couldn’t spare the manpower. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So the American war department was kind of desperate so they took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Me and, I and one other girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">We were the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We were two years below their minimum age. </span><span class="sentence"

</span><span class="sentence" id="796">These were German children and it had a terrible effect on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And then an older man, older, he was probably like in his

<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">ANSWER:  Oh I, we went there a couple of months ago I believe and there are things now that I just pass by, things that show what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">The pictures of the signs on <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and no Jews and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">It, can I say it leaves me cold but it has no impact anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">There are other things of course that impact me greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">But I, when I went down to find you people, that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I, you could research your family or friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I had never been there before and we stayed until the last minute really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And that’s where you found out about me, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I found that fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I met somebody else there who I didn’t even think he was Caucasian, but he was Jewish and a wonderful, wonderful man and we had great conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">It’s absolutely fabulous.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">QUESTION:  They did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">ANSWER:  Oh of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">My mother jabbered along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">My father tried to express himself well you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So I mean but both of them were fluent in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">In fact we corresponded in English in our letters was in English.</span></p>

QUESTION:  As I said we appreciate that you did because it is a part of your story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">It’s part of your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">ANSWER:  It was so difficult for me to accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And both of them died there.</span></p>
