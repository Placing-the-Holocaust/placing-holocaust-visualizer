them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">They knew the way we looked, the way we were dressed, still in these prisoners' clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">Then we decided to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> there were many displaced people in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> came there, and we took over a <span class="BUILDING">military place</span> where they have soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">Probably they gave it

served in the British Army came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took as many at that time, maybe four, five, six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">They took us through the Brenner Pass to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolzano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">And then we went on <span

kept asking, "Why, we want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">What are we going to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">So they told us very politely and explained that the British Army intercepts every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and young people are taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">If you are either ill or very old, you know, or sick, whatever, you can go -- and women, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">They took women and very old people, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">Very few men or no men except when they're really sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">During that period, we contacted our brother, Arthur, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">We didn't remember his -- we remembered only <span class="DLF">Hotel Broadway</span> and I got friendly -- I don't know -- it had to do with UNRRA, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">There was -- no, this happened even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , American officers, they used to come around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">I told them I have a brother and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">They talked to different people in their experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">This particular guy was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">I told him we had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but I don't know how to contact him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">There's no mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">He said, "Give me his address." </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">I told him his name and he used to live at <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Broadway</span> when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">He wrote to <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Broadway</span> , and then we left so we didn't see him and did the same thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> ; I talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">And he sent a letter to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and my brother sent us $500, wired $500 to an <span class="BUILDING">Italian bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">The <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> didn't know where to find us, but they knew there were displaced people in that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">So they sent somebody, they took the name down and called the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">He said, "Our <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> has some money for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">We understood mostly, me and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">We came there, we didn't know one word of Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">So the manager says, "Do you speak German?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1738">Of course, we speak German." </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">He says, "Come after 3 o'clock." </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">So my brother says, "Why after 3:00?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1741">It's better," he says, "it's better come after 3:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">If you need some -- I'll give you some money now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">I'll give you $20." </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">It was like 2,000 liras. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">No, no, 20,000 liras -- no, 2,000; I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">We came after 3:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">To show what a gentleman he was, he said, "The official rate is 100 liras. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">If I give it to you officially, you will get the $500." </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">One hundred liras, it's like half a million liras, you know. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1750">Because you came now, you get 10 times as much, see?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">So we got a lot of liras, we thought we're millionaires right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">What do we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">I put in my pocket, my brother put in his pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">We had a couple of friends waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">We told them, "Let's go buy some food." </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">So we looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">We saw a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">trattoria</span> , and they displayed looked like chicken, bread, and whatever else, some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">We bought a lot of stuff, brought it back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">We shared it with some of our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">One guy starts eating the chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">He says, "This is not chicken."

<p><span class="sentence" id="2099">QUESTION:  When did you start talking in detail and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2100">ANSWER:  I had -- almost had a guilt feeling not to talk about it, you know, and even my children, I talked -- I remember talking to them and Eleanor would elaborate maybe to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">Because I remember our older son was six years old, he wanted a certain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> that his friend had, our neighbor, his friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">And Eleanor and I took him on a Saturday morning to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">And he showed us which one, then he saw made in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">He said, "Dad, I don't want you to buy this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">It's made in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">So he already -- he was six or seven -- if he knew it, the other siblings knew it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">And I was telling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">When I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> only about seven, eight years ago, I told them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">I took our son along and one of my nephews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">Maurice, my brother's, Maurice's son, two cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">We all went for the first march of the women, you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">I couldn't believe what they did to us, but I consider myself a very responsible individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">And I look out for the underdog and I pray for a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">And never again, it should never happen again to any <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> or to any people, wherever they live, whoever they are.</span></p>
