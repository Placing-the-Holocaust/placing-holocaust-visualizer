<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Could you tell us a little about what life was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> while you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Life, Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> was a vibrant life. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We had <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had Jewish organizations, Zionist organizations, Jewish sports clubs, general Zionist organizations where all the people, all the organizations met and they used to organize dances over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The Jewish newspaper, the publisher had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was very, a very active Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What kind of work did your father do at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  My father worked for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the tax department until 1937 when he was dismissed by the government because at that time anti-Semitism was at its peak and they dismissed all the Jewish workers that worked for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and at that time he got a job in a Zionist organization where he served sandwiches and you know, tended to the <span class="INT_SPACE">card room</span> to organize the events the Jewish organizations sponsored. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He was in charge of those things, with my mother of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They were working together. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> over there and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buffet tables</span> , where they you know, tended to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buffet tables</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What did you do as a youngster? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You must have been nine years old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">What was life like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  It was a happy life of a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I started out in a <span class="BUILDING">Cheder</span> and then I attended the <span class="BUILDING">Javne school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish progressive school</span> run under rabbinical supervision until the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I knew nothing of another world but a Jewish world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What about some of your friends at the trme? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Were they all Jewish or did you have any non- Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  I had, well of course I had Jewish friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , non-Jewish friends I used to play with where I, where we lived on <span class="DLF">Venskogo Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">This was 1n a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> for the city workers when my father was still active in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I made some friends and we used to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">When I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I used to play with non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There was no talk against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I used to visit their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They used to come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there was no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  When did you start seeing a problem, or feeling a problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  The problems started after Marshal Pilsudski died. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He was the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Afterwards anti-Semitism became stronger, much stronger and as a matter of fact when he died the Polish anti-Semites used to run into the <span class="DLF">street</span> and call to the Jews, your grandfather died, because he was very good to the Jews, the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And it was at a peak as I said, in 1937 came to a peak where antisemitism was very strong and I don't think that the Germans would have such a good time taking over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> if not for this anti-Semitism that existed at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  How did you see it? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">This was 1938? [</span><span class="sentence" id="50">1939]
ANSWER:  Yes, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">A week before the Germans came in, it was a chaos in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The Jewish people were really scared and they hired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and whatever they could get, transportation to run towards the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> away from the German invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They, especially men because it was a talk that the Germans when they come in right away they take the men for slave labor and they massacre the Jewish populations on the way as they come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We heard stories from the German Jews that were pushed across the <span class="DLF">borders</span> a couple of years before that, terrible stories but nobody could visualize what really is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Nobody believed it, the kind of stories they used to tell, how the Germans treated the the Jewish population in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And nobody can really understand what the Jewish people went through unless they themselves went through the war, the holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It's impossible to understand, to to comprehend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Martin, let's go back to what you were saying a moment ago, that nobody would believe the stories that they were being told by the Jews who were coming back into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the time from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">What were some of the stories or what was the feeling that you and your parents were getting from these stories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Well there were stories of Jews being grabbed from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and from <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> for slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They were beaten in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , their belongings confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> being confiscated, their properties being confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And some of the people never come back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They were telling stories about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Nobody could could comprehend what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> wer in those years, and as I said it's very hard to understand unless you yourself go through it, went through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  You were going through it at the time and at that time, 1938, 01:10 you were ten years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I was eleven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Eleven years of age. (</span><span class="sentence" id="70">Yes) And from your memory of that time immediately before the war, immediately before the Germans advanced into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> , what do you remember of the experience as you saw it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  The day before the Germans came in was very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I remember like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was like a holiday atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There was no movement except at night the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were robbed, broken into. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">the <span class="BUILDING">government warehouses</span> where broken into. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I even went during the day I went to look how they carried, people carried out cartons with cigarettes and with all kinds of things from that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">There was a fear 1n the <span class="DLF">air</span> that you couldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Spies were being caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">German spies were being caught, and daily air raids, bombing <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> even. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> a a bomb fell on a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and when the air raid sirens were sounding off we yelled to my father, you know, let's go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He says, oh no, there's nothing going to happen, until the bomb hit the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and and he fell out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Then he was running to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And we lived near the <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> where they were registering the new recruits. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And that day and night there was a very busy <span class="NPIP">place</span> and while we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> hiding, we heard someone upstairs 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> and our neighbor was a fireman. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He had a gun on him, and he went to look and he brought down a very scared person, a man, and when he asked him what he was doing, in his state he said he was looking for bullets for his gun, because he had also a gun on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So they sat him down by candlelight in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and the fireman you know, said to my father he says, look through his papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And my father's hands were shaking and he was looking through his papers and if my father would have said he's a spy, the gun would have, you know, the fireman would have shot this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But my father said he's alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">His papers are OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And later on he, my father told me, you know, I didn't even look at the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I was so scared I couldn't see anything. (</span><span class="sentence" id="92">Laughter) So but they were catching spies, musicians that were going from <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> to <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and they had maps and papers on on their bodies under their shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Some when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming over, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> were coming over, they caught a few that had radios on them talking to the pilots. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I remember, you know, a lot a lot of people were being caught as spies, it was a chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">A week before the Germans came in a bomb, a time bomb went off at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and one person got killed, a woman that was in transit, a Jewish woman in transit, and I have her name written down. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">As a matter of fact, am working now with a with a lady that this was her aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Just happens that we were talking about the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She says you know, my aunt was killed by a bomb in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> at the beginning, before the Germans came in, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I said I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Things, things come back into memories that when the Germans came in, on September 8th, I was on a corner, standing on a corner on <span class="DLF">Main Street</span> watching them coming in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Truck</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and the German military police was standing directing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And they all were asking directions to the main crossing point on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">One <span class="DLF">road</span> led to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> in the direction of the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> and one towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I was standing over there watching the guards that were on each corner of 01:16: the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they had belts, belt buckles and it said, Got mit uns, so at that time as a kid I was wondering what kind of God did they believe in. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Which god. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Cruel people, they didn't seem cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I, as a kid you know, I always admired military uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They had beautiful uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And had those two grenades under their belts, and standing guard over there with a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I, as a kid you know, you admire military people and I was fascinated by the military splendor that they came in with, organized, motorized. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It wasn't like this under the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Polish government, I've seen soldiers come running back, retreating where they had their shoes on their shoulders and barefooted running back. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And this fascinated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was a well motorized, organized army that came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  How long did it take after they first came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> before you and your family felt their presence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  As soon as they came in, it didn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It took a day or two where the horror begun, where they started searching and confiscating the Jewish properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They took old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Especially they picked on Jews with beards, religious people, to take them out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> and to clean the manure, horse manure from the <span class="DLF">street</span> with their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They didn't give them brooms, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They were degraded to a point where even an animal doesn't do it and at that time we were seeing what those people that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There were people that were rounded up, young people in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> - that's near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">This was just a beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There were some of them came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They were telling stories about working conditions in those in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">People were really horrified because you never knew when you would be grabbed in the <span class="DLF">street</span> .

<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  My father swore to me I shouldn't speak about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Nobody will believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They will say that, that I made it up . . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">.He was partially right; even our Jewish people said it really happened (7?) ... </span><span class="sentence" id="195">1 don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">How can anyone make up a story like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">At that time when I hid with my father in that <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , we heard, it was during the day, we heard my sister scream, calling my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It happened that a German soldier came 1n and was looking you know, for Jews, and my mother showed the birth certificate and had an ID card and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It took a few days till the whole thing subsided but as I understand from people that survived, the <span class="BUILDING">gathering places</span> was the main <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> , , In the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> , was jammed with people that were either killed on the spot or taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsec concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And actually it was, and that camp nobody came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsec</span> , out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">When it was over my mother sent my sister because she was little and she figured nobody was going to bother her in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , to see 1f anybody from the relatives is still alive, and she had an old aunt living in that <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> with two daughters and this aunt was already 90 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So when my sister came up there, they told her that they didn't bother to kill her on the spot, this old woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They took her by the legs and arms and threw her from the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> down on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the dead bodies, alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And it was Mala Lubash (ph) and her sister Golda Reich, with her husband, the old Tante Lubash they killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That was the first deportation and massacre in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">At that time 12,000 people died because before they massacred, they ordered all the Jews from surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> , from smaller <span class="REGION">areas</span> , to move in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">No Jews were allowed to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and the <span class="REGION">farm areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They had to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So the population swelled you know and they had a better a better easier way of killing the Jews that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  While the activities were taking place, were the Jewish residents living in what could be described as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at that time, or did that come later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed after the first action was taken, after the first deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I'll tell you about my father why I skipped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I wanted to tell a story about my father on the first day of the deportation, across the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , across the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> lived a Jewish policeman and when my father heard, you know, he went to ask him advice, his advice what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And while he was in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the Gestapo people came into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and when they saw him coming out from Mr. Gelb's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my father didn't have any papers on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was all destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It didn't take much just for the Gestapo man to ask my father, Ausweis, papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">This this would have been the end of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But they didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">My father was so weak, so scared, that he braced himself against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and his knees started to buckle and the Gestapo man says, said to my father, are you sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">My father said nein. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Are you besoffen? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Are you are you drunk? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He said nein. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Where do you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So my father pointed to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door and he says, Zurueck nach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hause</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So one of them couldn't take it because this was a higher ranking officer told my father to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He run after my father and give him a kick in the behind you know and my father fell into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But as I said, the whole war that we lived through was destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Each one who has any family saved the others' lives which I will - so the first was my mother, because she saved us because she was an American citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Let's hear a little about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Just prior to the war, your mother made efforts to obtain visas for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Yes, in 19... in 1938 my mother wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and they said that they're going to issue her a visa if she will come to <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw Consulate</span> and sign papers testifying that she never voted in the Polish elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And she procrastinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She was busy with this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">She never thought of going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> until 1939 when there was talk about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> said that she should come immediately because they are evacuating all the American citizens and she should come to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And she still procrastinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So they said you can go back to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but your family has to stay behind because we can't issue visas anymore for your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And she didn't want to go by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">She said if they have to stay, I will stay with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That's how she got stuck as an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> ignored her. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They just left her to fend for herself as a Jewess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  They were difficult years. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Difficult years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Just after the deportation, as you were describing it before, where were you and what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  The Germans made the <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish quarters</span> smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They tightened the <span class="REGION">area</span> for the Jews, made it smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The part where we lived on the little <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> was out of the Jewish area, so we had to move in into a smaller.... , well, this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And at that time we had to, my father and I had to go back to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">My mother went with my sister to the Farber's to live, to her uncle, and a short time later they found <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for my father and myself also and we slept ten people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because the Farbers had their son and their relatives come from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> to live with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">At that time they thought that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> is, will be safer and they wanted to stay with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So there were ten people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> sleeping on the 01:44: <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And it didn't take long till the second deportation started. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And we heard about the date because the Germans said the Jews should be ready for a transport on this and this date, and Uncle Farber in his <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> dug two ditches underneath the floorboards of the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">One for his family and one for his immediate relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I thought that we are included so my father said as soon as he heard about the deportation, he says let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">This was the day before the actual date, and went to hiding in the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">When the action began it was too late already for the Farber family to get there because the Germans were rounding up the Jews already and they couldn't go through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , so you know Uncle Farber and his two daughters climbed up on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and there was a big <span class="DLF">chimney</span> like the <span class="BUILDING">European buildings</span> have, those wide <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> , hid behind the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and it didn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The Germans were rounding up the Jews in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and one of the neighbors, downstairs neighbors, pointed out to the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> to the Germans Uncle Farber with his two daughters, and that's how he was killed and my family hid under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">floorboards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we heard shooting for about four days because this <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> was situated also on the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> had about four <span class="BUILDING">market places</span> and this was a gathering place for farmers and you know, when they came to, before the war, to the to the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> to sell their goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We were flat, prostrate on our backs under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">floorboards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We didn't know when is day, when was night, and all we heard was yelling and screaming and the German shepherd dogs barking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This was another thing, a miracle that the German shepherds didn't sniff us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">During the the massacre, during the action, there were Polish young people who helped the Germans kill Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There was the Legion, the Polish Legion they called themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And two of them came into the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> and they were standing right above us urinating and one said to the other, oh, if I catch a Jew, I won't give him over to the to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I will cut off his head with my axe. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And this was the attitude of the anti- Semites in in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They were even helping the Germans kill the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And when it was over we came out smelling like roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We were covered with feces and dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We looked at each other and started laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But during the deportations my mother was so scared underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">floorboards</span> that she was hallucinating and we had to slap her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">She saw a Gestapo man. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It was pitch dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">She was hallucinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">She saw a Gestapo man with that with a briefcase standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Slapped her face to keep her quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Really - if someone had a bad heart this was the end of the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Could never live through if someone was weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">You had to be a really super strong to - all the people that survived the war were people that were strong, strong people. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Otherwise you couldn't survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  For four days you stayed under the boards?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Why did you emerge? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">What....
ANSWER:  When it was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">It was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And...
QUESTION:  What did you see when you came out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  When we came out we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">Farber's house</span> , and nobody talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Everybody kept to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was like someone died in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Actually they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But nobody talked about it and each one of us went back to their own chores. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">After each deportation the Germans, they (re)organized the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , re-registered the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that I worked with my mother was called Madritsch (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="303">This was a German firm, actually Austrian, an Austrian firm that used to make military coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">and I used to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">pressers room</span> where I used to wring out the rags for the pressers. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with blisters on my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I couldn't move them. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">All day, you know, have my hands in water and and wringing out rags and then after the pressers got through with pressing the coats, they loaded coats on my shoulder and I used to carry the coats to the to the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they were sewing on the buttons on the coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">That's where my mother worked, and as I said, after each deportation they re-registered and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was getting smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Each time they were making the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after the second deportation, they split the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in two. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto A</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto B.</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto A</span> was for the slaveworkers and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto B</span> was for people who didn't work - for the old people and for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And then after the deportation when they were re-registering - let me, let me go back a little bit - I want to make a point of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">When I was carrying the coats there was a group of women, the wives of the managers, German managers and the owners of the firm came for an inspection of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And when one woman saw me carrying the coats, she says, oh what a pity - that little boy with a load like this on his shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Soon after I was called to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I said to myself, oh, this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , there was the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the Austrian, standing there with a smile, and he says to me, how do you like to work over here? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I said, it's alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He says, how is your health? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I said fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It seems like his wife said something about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He says, then he says to me, if you need anything, come to me and tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And this manager, the Jewish manager Mr. Weinstock, who managed the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , was getting fidgety and he excused me by saying that I have to back to work and shoved me out of the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">This Mr. Madritsch I'll never forget because this Mr. Madritsch after the war, wrote a book, how he saved 500 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> by creating a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">He did it with a purpose, and he wrote a book and they put up a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> in his name in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad vaShem</span> .

QUESTION:  Martin, we were talking about the transportations, and you mentioned you had something very important to add.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  One morning I got up early before all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I looked around the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There were ten people on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> sleeping and as I was dressing I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> that was leading outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> with soldiers, a whole column going towards the <span class="DLF">ghetto gate</span> and as they were riding down towards the <span class="DLF">gate</span> they were dropping off Polish policemen across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to stand guard watching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I knew right away what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">This was the third deportation taking place and right away I screamed out an alarm - the Germans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And everybody got up and they started running in every direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">People didn't know what what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They were not prepared for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And my parents and my sister started running towards that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> again in the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We couldn't get there because the we realized when we were in the <span class="DLF">street</span> already that the <span class="DLF">gate</span> that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> were coming in to where it was in our way, between the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And we couldn't get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So we turned around and my father told us to get in to the first <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was on our way, as we were retreating, and it was a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , an old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where you come into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there is a big <span class="DLF">door</span> , a <span class="DLF">wooden door</span> and then a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and there was a complete chaos 1n that <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">People were running, screaming names Chaim, Moishe. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And they had a big <span class="DLF">ladder</span> against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and there was an <span class="DLF">opening</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , high up, and they were climbing the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">How many people can go into that -

<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Let's go back to...
ANSWER:  Yeah, to the registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">When my mother came in she faced the Gestapo man. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He, the Gestapo man asked her if she has a husband and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And my mother was afraid to say - she didn't know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My father and my sister and I were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We didn't know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And the head of the Jewish community was standing by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he said -

that we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">One we sent, we addressed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where my mother had an aunt by the name of Miller, Tante Miller, and she always, my mother always drummed the address into our heads just in case we will be separated during the war that after the war we should meet over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Eight Rue des Bains (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> and, but they never received mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Shortly under German escort they marched us through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakau</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , <span class="BUILDING">political prison</span> , Monteluppe (ph) where we spent nine weeks, men separated from women. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">We didn't know of each other's fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and there were straw sacks burlap burlap bags with straw as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and a niche in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> for a bucket for sanitary conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The <span class="DLF">windows</span> were facing the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and they had a metal cover wider at the top so the sun can come in and on the bottom was narrower with holes on the bottom for drainage, water drainage. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And a few days later they brought in more prisoners to our <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , also Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> and surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">As we found out they had false papers, foreign papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They paid for those papers and the Germans registered them as as foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We were about ten people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and on the way to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> one day in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> we met Jews that were prisoners of that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> there, <span class="BUILDING">political prison</span> - Jews were considered - as Jews they were not political. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They were considered lower than animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They were 02:21: not even human because they were not human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But they told us on passing - they were coming out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and we were going in and we looked at each other and they had pieces of noses missing, pieces of ears that were all scratched and bitten, so one of them said that when they are being punished, they are being thrown into <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> with mad dogs, German shepherds, and that's what happens you know, when the German shepherds attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">During the day we saw exercises in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where they were exercising the prisoners, Jewish prisoners, and they were beating them and torturing them with sticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They were being hit in the Adam's apple while they were running around in circles or they told them to climb up a pile of coal on their elbows and and and their knees, up the pile and as they were sliding down they were hit over the backs with a boards, two by twos. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">One day we were very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We ate ate anything that was given to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">One day we heard somebody by the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we had to line up for food and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens up. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We are standing already ready to get food and there was a SS man, SS officer with his shining boots and gloves in his hand, and he seemed like a little drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And he says, "Also Juden Spruch". </span><span class="sentence" id="469">He says Spruch (saying). </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We didn't know what he means. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So everybody kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So he keeps yelling again, Spruch. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And with that he hits the first man in the row, which was Bloomenstock, right in the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">He says I'm going to teach you what Spruch means. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And he goes like this. "</span><span class="sentence" id="476">wir Juden sind schuldig an allElend wenn das kosbare Deutsches Blut fliesst, wir Juden sind Gauner, wir Juden sind Verbrecher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Which means?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Which means, we Jews are guilty when dear blood that 1s spilt - German blood that is spilt - Jews are Gauner, I don't know how to translate it - it's it's like a thief you know [actually means criminal ]- a Verbrecher means a murderer [also means criminal]- we were the murderers. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And I will be back in one hour and we'll have to know the "Spruch" and with that he closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And we were sure he's going to come back and everybody - I didn't, I never heard, I never saw people learning so fast the language - in one hour (laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And I still remember. (</span><span class="sentence" id="482">laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So he never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I still know the "Spruch".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  And you stayed there for nine weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  For nine weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">After nine weeks they took us out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and were reunited with the women, with my mother, my sister and the others and the Germans told us to face the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And while we were standing with our faces to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , they were loading and reloading the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It seemed like they were trying to scare us because a few minutes later, a few minutes - it was like a half an hour later two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came and a German officer came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It was Wehrmacht, the regular Army and he told us that we are being taken to be exchanged, to the <span class="BUILDING">exchange station</span> where they will exchange the German prisoners and we were being loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pullman cars</span> and while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was in motion -

the same amount in monetary, in money will be given to us when we will be exchanged either to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in their monetary value. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And he told us to sign the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived on the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin station</span> and the Red Cross was waiting for us with milk for the children and all kinds of goodies - chocolate and so on - bread and the Red Cross knew about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We were the Auslaender, the foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Everybody was nice to us on the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">At <span class="BUILDING">Berlin station</span> they attached another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with other group of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And we were on our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Two hours out of the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin station</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And we saw the SS surrounding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with dogs and they came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they started yelling for us to get out and hitting us with their guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We turned to the commandant, to the German officer that said that we're going to be exchanged - wanted to know what is the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He says I don't know myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He said this end of <span class="DLF">line</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">They told me to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And we're being thrown out, out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and lined up and as they were passing by, the the SS men passing by, one says in German to the other soldier, he says oh, "ein Maschinengewehr ist genug.” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">One machine gun is enough for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So we knew, we thought we knew what what was waiting for us, and after a while <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came backing up and they loaded us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they put down the flaps you know in the back so we wouldn't see where we're going but through the <span class="DLF">opening</span> we saw we are going through a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and my father took us around and he started praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">After a while we arrived at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We saw barbed wires, pine trees all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Smelled beautifully because the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was freshly built. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The wood the wood of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> still smelled fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was in the summer of 1943 and they unloaded us on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we saw across the <span class="DLF">road</span> British and Russian prisoners still finishing the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It seems like they took the prisoners of war for the work for building the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We found out we were in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It seems like we are the first ones to open up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> while we were standing over there waiting something to happen, something happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">All of a sudden I lost my strength in my legs . . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">My legs started giving and I feel I didn"t have the strength to standon my legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So my mother started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">There was a nice young strong man in our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He picked me up and he was holding me in his arms until the Germans came and they were leading us away into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They assigned us a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and they put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and they called a German doctor, a German military doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">He came and he diagnosed it as Rose (ph) Fever, from malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I got Rose Fever in my legs and they would swell up, swelled up and and had reddish spots -
