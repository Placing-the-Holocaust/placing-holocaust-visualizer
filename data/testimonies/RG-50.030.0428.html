<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  If you can, talk a little bit about before the war actually interrupted your studies, what were you hearing about what was going on in Europe and how was it a part of your consciousness?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well I can actually remember the day that war was declared in September of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">We were still in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the family was just able, my father was just able to send the family away to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I can actually remember the, the war starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">At that time I was 16 years old, so that there was a consciousness of a teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">As with most of the people here at that time, as I recall it, it was a distant thing, we knew the war was going on, I mean, you, we heard about the bombings, we knew the war was going on, we knew that the refugees were coming here or starting to come here, but very frankly knew very little about the nuances of it, we knew very little about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that were turned away, the one that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> and was turned away. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">This came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">If I speak of it now, it's because of something that I'd read about, but at the time it was a war that was in Europe, you know, the war's in Europe again and I guess, particularly at 16 and being involved in track and girls and things like that, I really thought very little about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We followed it, you couldn't help but follow it, 1t was in the headlines all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So we knew about the <span class="DLF">Magino(ph) line</span> , we knew about the problems of the bombings of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and so on and until <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> entered the war, for us 1t was happening in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We were not, at the time, as knowledgeable as we are now about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We knew of course, about Kristallnacht, we knew about Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">In fact I remember as a child, listening to Hitler, I remember that they broadcast here, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they broadcast some of the speeches and I remember, whether it was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> or some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the absolute electricity of this man when he spoke and I must say I hear the patterns with some of the people we have around the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> now, you can actually hear the patterns, you can hear if you've studied the patterns and the things they were said, without getting into the politics of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you could begin to hear how he enthralled the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Later on I was to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , later on I was to see the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , later on I was to see the films of all of these, these rallies, but we actually remember them and I can remember to this day, sitting in the little <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> that we had in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> and listening to this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Any other memories about that, perhaps that your father might have had or your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Your father might have still had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or any concern there might have been in the family for Jews in general or specific people that you knew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well I think, without being religious Jews, we all, always did have and still do have a feeling of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father did not have family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So that we have always felt a very deep feeling of Judaism without being religious Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father did speak of other pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He was brought up in <span class="REGION">area</span> where the Cossacks were very, very active and her remembers the raids in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puniaman(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I found out much later in life that I was one thirty-second Cossack, which was something that destroyed my brother when he heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We don't know where the great, great, great, great grandfather was the rapist or whatever it may have been, but we were one thirty- second Cossack. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In terms of Europe, from 1933 say, until the war began and I was much more involved certainly, in listening, we really had very, as I recall, very little discussion about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And that may have been very normal in the family, I just don't remember very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  You enlisted, why did you, what were your reasons? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Do you remember speaking to your family about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I, as a matter of fact I enlisted because, there was a war, they were beginning to draft people, my father had spent, I guess a year and a half or so in World War | as an infantryman. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He was wounded three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The third time he was wounded they wanted to take his leg off because of gangrene. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And that's an interesting story in that he then refused to sign the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And he wouldn't sign the paper and the gangrene receded. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He said, "I came into this world with two legs, I'm going out with two legs." </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The gangrene receded. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My father, from 1918, never went to a doctor, until he was 83 years old and hurt himself working in the dress business, a bolt of cloth had fallen on his wrist and I made him go to the doctor and the doctor said, "Well Mr. London, when was the last time you visited a doctor?" </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He said, "1918." </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And the doctor said, "Well, you're none the worse for it." </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My father said to me, "Don't ever get in the infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Do anything to get out of the infantry." </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And he had gone through three wounds and the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and of course, as every soldier he only told funny stories about how his mother sent potato pancakes overseas, you know and they arrived like rocks, but he never told about the terror and the horror of it, but he did communicate to me that it was pretty awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And so I enlisted in, I actually enlisted in the enlisted reserve in May of '43 and was in the signal corps, I enlisted in the signal corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And that probably, that and also getting pneumonia when my unit went overseas to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D-Day</span> , saved my life, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with pneumonia, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But that was the basic reason I enlisted was I knew I would be drafted, but I thought I might just as well enlist and get some kind of a background and that signal corps background in fact, was the thing that created a career for me later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So I enlisted and I went to, into the army where several things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">One, to make me understand more about anti-Semitism, because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> particularly and I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> at 17 and pretty much at 19 I enlisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> you got very little of it, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> was very heavily Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I was now coming into the United States army, a democracy of sorts, or fighting for a democracy, where I began to come into anti-Semitism in both it's subtle and it's overt forms. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was obvious if you were going to be in the army you were going to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I mean the anti-Semitic jokes that suddenly started to be told around me while someone turned and says, "Well, I don't mean you, I don't consider you Jewish," when after all, I am Jewish, is one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The second thing was that I, after two years, went to OCS. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I had gone all the way from...
QUESTION:  What's OCS?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Officer Candidate School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I had gone from private to PFC and then they busted me back to private because they didn't have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a PFC you see and I decided I was going nowhere after two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Luckily I was teaching in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was teaching at officer, at <span class="BUILDING">officer school</span> as a private and a PFC, I was teaching colonels and generals and like an idiot I kept volunteering to go overseas with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I wanted to go to <span class="REGION">New Guinea</span> , I wanted to go to Europe and nobody would let me go, I was one of eight people who had a top secret clearance with the United States army, teaching this course, so nobody would let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I finally decided the only way to get out of this would be to go into <span class="BUILDING">Officer Candidate School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So I applied for <span class="BUILDING">Officer Candidate School</span> and again , In speaking of the, the anti-Semitism in the army, I was in a company, I was first sergeant in a company of 250 officer candidates. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There were 13 Jews and two blacks and I, as first sergeant, was allowed to pick my roommate. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You see, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were made up and if you've seen <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they were made up of 60 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , double decker and one <span class="INT_SPACE">squad room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The <span class="INT_SPACE">squad room</span> was where there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and the first sergeant and one other non-commissioned officer would be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">squad room</span> , so you had a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And so I had to become very friendly with a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington D. C.</span> named Bob MacNeil(ph), who happened to be one of the two blacks and having been brought up on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , I mean I was on a track team with all kinds of people, it made no difference to me and he was the only guy who seemed to understand inner city thinking and was getting the same kind of battering from the others that I was getting, so in front of a company of 250 men, the man was Lieutenant Coyne(ph), Lieutenant Coyne(ph) said, "Mr. London," I said, "Yes, sir." </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He said, "As first sergeant you can choose anyone you like to spend the next three months in the <span class="INT_SPACE">squad room</span> with you" and I said, "Mr. MacNeil(ph) sir," so in front of 250 men, I picked one of the two blacks, in 1943 or '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">This was pretty much unheard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Two things happened, several things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Number one, the day before graduation, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I always say, quite by accident, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out and one of the two blacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The only two people left of that entire group starting, were Bob MacNeil(ph) and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">At the dance, at the graduation dance, Cheryl, who is my wife of 50 years now, as you know and I knew then, I met her when she was 17 and was still in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Monmouth(ph</span> ) to attend the dance and Bob had a friend, a woman named Lua(ph), attend the dance and they had dance cards in those days, you actually had a dance card so that you signed up for the dance and I signed up for a dance with Lua(ph) and she was black also and I, I went on the <span class="INT_SPACE">dance floor</span> with her when our turn came and that was fine and then came the time for Bob to dance with Cheryl and as she got on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with him, the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> emptied and all the colonels sitting up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> looked like they were getting nauseous and they were leaning over and Bob said, "Do you want to stop dancing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You got to remember, this is in the 40's and she said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And they danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Nothing ever happened, I was then assigned and then came an interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">For two years in the army, I was assigned to black troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I went down to the south and I trained with black troops, I went overseas with 4000 black troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">black replacement depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I was then shipped to a replacement company, picking up wire behind Mauclauck's(ph) third army, the 258 signal light construction company, which is a black company. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I said to a black friend of mine, "I have a feeling that after that incident at, in OCS, they put N on my service record for Negro." </span><span class="sentence" id="76">She said, "Maybe they put nigger lover on your service record, NL." </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And that was, but it turned out to be one of the great, great army experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I mean, if you had to have a great army experience, this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So all of this comes as a background of meeting <span class="REGION">middle America</span> in all of this and being much more aware of how our own people felt about Jews, about blacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I mean, being so isolated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , I guess I, it was another opening experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Now, then when I went to Europe and I was there about the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I did not see combat by the way, I was very lucky on that, for four years in the army, never to have seen combat was very lucky and again I thank my father for having been in the signal corps and taking, oh there was one funny thing by the way, which may or may not have anything to do with this but when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Officer Candidate School</span> as a second lieutenant, I was sent back to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again as a student, where I had written the examinations and I had taught for several years, which is a typical army thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I was now a lieutenant taking a course with examinations I had written. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I did very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In fact on one I think I got one question wrong once because I, I sloughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">When I went to Europe with the occupation forces then, I went through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and then on 40 and eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> out to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graffenau(ph</span> ) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , with the 258 signal light construction company. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I began to become much more aware of several things, number one, of course by that time I was aware of what the Germans had been doing, I did see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> after the fact, I knew all of this existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I never met a Nazi except once, though I was firmly convinced that everybody had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Nobody admitted it, which I think will come to pass when we talk about Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The one person who admitted that he had been a Nazi and a member of the Nazi party I hired as my driver in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He was the only honest man I could find and therein hangs a tale when you talk about what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , what happened to the people who claimed they never knew what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1946 for what we laughingly call rest and recuperation because I got married and Cheryl and I spent 60 days here on honeymoon, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to try to get her over and then she came over as the first of what she laughingly calls the dependents. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She then spent two years on Europe with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , where I was station manager of a <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , KOFA on the American Forces Network and then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with her as Program Manager of American Forces Network, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we spent the two years, we were there during the airlift and the Russian blockade. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Things, as always happened, it's, when you're in a situation, it seems to be a lot less important or a lot less threatening than it is to people who are reading about it in the Washington Post or the New York Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And though we were blockaded and we did have an airlift when the Russians turned the power off at 11 o'clock at night, we lit candles, 1t was that simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We flew out in 1948 on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C47 planes</span> , with our German Shepherd on our laps, you see and then came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So this was the story, essentially condensed, about these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Do you have any other questions on this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, if you want to talk a little bit about becoming aware of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , you were in Europe, particularly what did people say about it, what were your thoughts about it and anything about Albert Speer because after all, you eventually did interview him and we'll get to that, but in terms of having a background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Very good question because a lot of what my feeling were with Albert Speer later on and my experience with him had to do with the things that had happened then. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I was aware of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I knew what was going on at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I followed it very, very closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So a lot of what I, I felt at that time, or a lot of my experience at that time had a lot to do in turn with my feelings about Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Now I was not day to day involved in what was going on at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I knew what was going on at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , I passed through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> at the time of the trials, I knew the trials were going on, I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I knew what was going on at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , however, at that time an interesting thing happened, I was still in the army and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> and Cheryl was due to come over and we were setting up, we had a , akind of a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> with a <span class="DLF">moat</span> type of thing, where we had eight Americans and 12 German servants, Austrians, I thought it would always, Cheryl said she thought it would always be this way, you see and, and one of my best friends was a man named Dixie Howell. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Dixie Howell was a member, is a major, is a member of the engineers and I guess I was angry at what had happened, I realized that if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had won the war I would be dead, I___. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And so one day, since he was the engineer, he used to build the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffolds</span> to hang the people who were found guilty of massacring unarmed American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">SS men, people like that and I used to spend the morning watching the hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That is one of the most interesting things in terms of what it's done to me today, am I for the death penalty or against the death penalty, how could I stand there in the morning, at six o'clock in the morning on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> and watch people hanged, you see, and not care? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The eye for an eye, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But that had a lot to do later on, with when I was asked to do the Albert Speer interviews, because if I could spend those mornings, I obviously had a deep seated anger and hostility and a feeling of vengeance, to be able to stand and watch people hanged, whom I didn't even know, I mean these are not even like the great murders that we read about in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> today, to watch people hanged and to have no feelings while some of the soldiers who were there as honor guards, would faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And my feelings then, if I could go back to that, in fact I did some drawings and sent them to Cheryl, I went there and I would draw the hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Sure, I was 21 or 22 years old, it's not an excuse, it's just that that's what it was, I've thought about that often and as recently as the last couple of weeks in talking about death penalty and eye for an eye and so on and this came __ back to me and said, but if I stood there and I watched this, how do I feel now? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was going on through this time and I know what the, I of course knew even then what the results were, I knew when they were hanged, I knew about Goring taking the pills and committing suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I knew all about that then, but it was kind of apart from other things, this was we had won the war, we had the trial, we would hope it would never happen again and look what's happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I, Albert Speer I didn't even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I knew Goring, I knew Goebbels, I knew Himmler, I knew all of the names I should have known. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Speer was a non- entity to me, if you had mentioned Albert Speer to me at that time, I probably would have said, "Yeah, isn't he, isn't he the minister of armaments, maybe." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I say that in 20/20 hindsight, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">At 21 or 22 years of age, it's hard for me to tell you now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  If you can go back to the hangings a little bit, set that scene, what about the first time that you went and how often did you go and how many people were hung at a time and how long would you stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  I only went to three, maybe four and then, as with everything else, I mean it's, it isn't a, terrible to say, a novelty, but essentially it's, you know, remembering the time, remembering what we had just been through, it was a part of, a part, death was a part of life and remembering or, I remember there was another thing and you'll be talking to people who were dealing with refugees, Europe was in turmoil, this was not the way it 1s now, you did not get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> had no <span class="DLF">windows</span> , people were trying to find other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">If you traveled from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, people were crowding onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , I saw, I saw, this is something that just came back to me, I remember GI MP's shooting into the <span class="DLF">air</span> to keep people from getting onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">GI car</span> because the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were so crowded where people were going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to find, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to find their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Remember, everybody was a displaced person, including the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so you went from, from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> as an army person and you had your own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , all of with the <span class="DLF">windows</span> bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My first time to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> I sat, in the middle of the winter, with <span class="DLF">windows</span> , with four blankets around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I mean this was the way people traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When you look in context of what Europe was at that time, where when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and people got off and relieved themselves at the side of the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , these were pretty terrible times, so a hanging was part of life in this whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Now, how often did I go, I can remember three, there may have been a fourth and I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I didn't get a kick out of it, I went because it was something to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was a very, very dimly lit <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffold</span> in the middle and there was always, interestingly enough, whether I call it an honor guard, but a guard of GI's who were standing at the side, as I recall there may have been 10 or 12 in two rows and they were the witnesses to it and the, the sentence was read out in both German and English, it must have been in English too, because I remember what they were and there would be, a typical one would be somebody who had taken two GI's prisoners and had, had killed them, had shot them and was found guilty by a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and was hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Then the hoods were put over their heads, there were usually two at a time, both <span class="DLF">trap doors</span> were sprung at the same time, there's a priest and then I guess the thing I remember always is the bodies being put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> and one person being too log for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> and I would leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It took half an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And then probably went to breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I mean this is the way it was, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So in a sense this was as cold blooded as anything else that's ever been done, but it was again taken as part of what the daily life was at that time, you had trials, there were trials all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> I went to trials with people who had done, I can barely remember, I remember doing drawings of a priest who was brought up on trial and the people pleading for him and I used to send these drawing back to Cheryl, I still have the drawings. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You went because this was how Europe was coming out from the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  And your thinking about it in terms of not being disturbed by it was that these people committed crimes and they had to pay for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yes and at the same time that you knew that a lot of Americans had committed crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I mean they were not the only ones who shot prisoners and I guess the people who say we, you won therefore, do have a point. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">At the same time we won therefore, thank God, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But I guess, you know, I guess that it all came back to me later on, when we started to discuss <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and when we started to talk about my going to interview Albert Speer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Let's talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">In the interim, you became a film maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I don't know if you want to sort of just quickly bring us up to that and then to the point where you got an assignment to interview Albert Speer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I became, actually I became very quickly a radio announcer, a sportscaster, learned enough about sports and met enough athletes to hate sports and went into disc jockey and then into television and then by accident in 1956, standing on the corner of <span class="DLF">69th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span> , I met my company commander from World War 2 and he said to me, "What are you doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I said, "I'm a television director." </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he said, "Why are you in television, why don't you do film?" </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I said, "Well, I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he says, "I own a film company." </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Interestingly enough, during the war we hated one another, now we're in civilian clothes and he offered me a job in his <span class="BUILDING">film company</span> , that's how I became a film maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I teach at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> and I have told my students that's how you become a film maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Can you imagine if I'd been on <span class="DLF">70th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span> , or <span class="DLF">68th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span> , I would not be in film. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I became a documentary film maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I became interested in the documentary, never interested in the feature, mostly because of meeting I guess people you'd call real people. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">If you do a film on <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , you're going to actually be in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , you're not going to build sets. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I really, though I did do a lot of dramatic things on television, like play of the week, I really, never really enjoyed working with actors, I always enjoyed working with real people and finding out about them and I have a curiosity and so I became a documentary film maker and in 1963 was nominated for an Academy Award for a film on Parkinsonism and aging and then aging has been a subject of mine for a long time, I've done consultations on it, I've done seminars and I've been consultant. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But basically I've, I've worked in 60 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , my wife has been along on almost all of them as a part of the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I have a curiosity, I do have a curiosity and in 19, I guess in the mid-70's, I don't remember when Speer's book came out but it was in the 70's, Inside the Third Reich came out and I was called by McMillan, a woman at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">McMillan</span> by the name of Alma Trynor(ph), who also, incidentally was Jewish, which has something to do with it and the book was coming out and she said, "Let's have lunch" and we had Chinese lunch and she said we'd like you to go overseas and interview Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">By this time I knew a lot more about Albert Speer, I mean, not a lot, but a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">By this time I was now some years away from the whole thing and I had not read the book, she let me read the, I saw it in manuscript, I did not see it in the final book til later, saw it in manuscript and they had wanted to do a series of films to put Albert Speer on record about a great many of the things that he had written about in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I did not know at that time that there had been a lot of changes made from the German edition, I found this out much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And when she asked if I would do it, one would think I would have jumped on itt, actually I turned it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I turned it down and I said, "I couldn't do it, I can't go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I have great problems when I do go back on business." </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I had been back several times on travel films and on documentaries. "</span><span class="sentence" id="168">I really would prefer not to go to interview Albert Speer." </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And she said, "Well when in your life would you have a chance to meet and interview Hitler's number two man?" </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And I said, "Well I guess I never would." </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And now the curiosity begins to take over, right, you're a film maker, a documentary film maker and you're going to find out about this and then it occurred to me that there's a very weird, almost surreal feeling about going to interview a man who would have had you killed or have worked you to death if he had won or if I had been in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I couldn't resist it. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I said, "Yes, I will go." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And at that point I read the book again, I did all my research and reading about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> again, I found that I was going to go and I would have to really set my mind to the right attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I could not go there with the attitude that I wished he'd had hung, which I had, but if I was going to get anything from him, we would now have to have a kind of a hands off, polite attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I had no idea what he would be like and so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ) with Alma and we spent 10 days with Albert Speer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Talk a little bit more about how you felt when the woman from the <span class="BUILDING">publishing house</span> said, "I'd like you to go" and you said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I mean, why the automatic no? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">What was going through your head?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Well I probably, I probably laughed when I said no, I mean it was a very strange kind of a request. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I seldom on a job have said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I have said no on films where my ethics were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Without saying what <span class="NPIP">side</span> I'm on, but on some of the great issues of the world, such as abortion, the Vietnam War and so on, I had refused films. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I refused this on an emotional basis, that I really, number one, did not want to promote his book. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Number two, there's the gut feeling that I'm uncomfortable in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that's basically it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I guess though, that the, the whole idea of, as she said, meeting someone who was Hitler's number two man, overwhelmed everything else and I decided I would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But basically I think I've always had a feeling that if I sold one more copy of that book, I'm sorry I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">On the other hand, I'm all for people writing what they feel and, you know, and we have that now even with the David Irving book, though Saint Martens(ph) should probably never have taken it in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the, the title, the David Irving book is on Goebbels the one on Goebbels, which is a Holocaust revisionist, he's the great Holocaust revisionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I have no problem with him writing, I can't stand the man, but you see what I'm talking about, no problem with the book coming out, but why am I publicizing the book? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">At the same time, perhaps I could get some of the answers to which I had always felt I would like some answers and understanding also this was going to be a bright man, this was going to be a man who had really thought about what he was going to say and that can come later, we can talk about that, because I have many feelings about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So I went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  How did you prepare yourself emotionally to meet him in a somewhat open way? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And was that your goal or did you say to yourself, well I'm going to have opinions about this man and I just, I'm not going to get rid of them, I'm just going to put them to the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">How did you prepare yourself to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  That, it's again, talking to yourself and saying you know, what is your attitude going to be and I had done enough interviews to say, okay, for the moment, though I have an emotional context in this one, I am just not going to ever show hostility and by the way, there is later, we'll talk about his reaction to me and my reaction to him, after ten days, because he was very perceptive about how I felt and I was very perceptive about what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So it was a hands off thing, I mean it was no Albert-buddy, Mel-buddy thing, you have to understand that and that too is a part of our relationship that we can talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ) and my client Alma arrived there, I think that day later or the next day, I don't recall, but the first thing we were to do was to meet Albert Speer at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we were to go to dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And I was excited, in a strange way, I mean after all, it's if you'd said you're going to meet Adolf Hitler I would be excited in a strange way. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">This was not just meeting somebody who was the president of a corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I came down from the, from my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , Alma was still up in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I came down from my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> when he came in with his wife Margaretta and I'll never forget the reaction of the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They absolutely were enchanted with this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">This is after the war, this 1s after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , this is after he got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> and the greeting of the manager could not have been more effusive. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I was introduced to him, we were, shook hands, I met his wife, we shook hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Alma came down and we went to dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We went to dinner at a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> of his choosing, which again set the pattern for all the time we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> was at least 50 or 60 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The owners, as I recall were at least 60 years old and therefore were of his generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He had chosen a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> where the greeting would be absolutely the top greeting that he could get, it was the great customer coming in of any <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , here is one. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I, that was the first startling thing, was that these people still admired and probably adored this man and that was a little shaky, contrasted with the fact that from that point on, everywhere else we went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ), whether it was to have a Coca-Cola in a small <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> or in the case of my client Alma, having her hair done one day, every time we walked into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the young people walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The word got around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and this 1s ironic, the word got around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that friends of Albert Speer were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">This Jewish friend from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> was therefore ignored by most of the people who were in their 20's and 30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Alma's hairdresser walked right out on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">She had made an appointment, came in, they said, "That's Albert Speer's friend" and they walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so there was this incredible separation of the, so there was this incredible separation of generations and very obvious one. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Now I was there for 10 days and there were several times that we had dinner with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Most of the time we did have dinner at his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was also a strange experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I met some of his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He seemed quite distant from the children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I have a feeling from the short conversations, their politics were quite different from his. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I have a feeling also, after 20 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> , he had a great, great distance from the children, I think there was an emotional distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That was a feeling, I mean, you never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">His wife Margaretta was the classic, well -meaning, polite German frau. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">She never was close to any of our crew. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">She never was close to us, she did what she had to do and he in turn was always polite, always wore a suit or a jacket, which meant I always wore a sult. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">These days perhaps we'd be in blue jeans, but we always wore a suit and we spent the 10 days, almost entirely, talking and filming and discussing the things we discussed on film. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Hitler, Hitler as an artist and we did a film also later on, which I'll talk about, on architecture in a totalitarian regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  And who wrote down the questions and structured the interview? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Were you involved in that, was that your client, did you have a sense that there were any subjects that were skirted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  I set up the questions basically, with my client, but basically they were, they were based on the book and also on questions that I had had all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I mean now, finally, I have a chance to, I have a chance to speak to Hitler's number two man and I'm going to ask him questions, which becomes a difficult thing, because he had spent his 20 years, let's go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , the man at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and if I may, the question I had, if I go back, if I can just digress for a minute 1s why was Goring sentenced to death, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Well, he was a very well known man and VonShurak(ph) and all the people there, why were they sentenced to death and why did two or three of them get away with 20 years on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">My feeling then, as my feeling now, even after meeting him, is that he should have been hanged too. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But a very interesting thing came up, I asked him a question that I think was the key and Gidda Serany(ph) in her book Albert Speer; His Battle with Truth, brings it up, I think it's on page 167 and I would like to read to it to a moment. "</span><span class="sentence" id="235">The New York Times, when he died, printed an obituary and an editorial, both of which said Albert Speer was the only man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to say he was guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Sitting on a <span class="DLF">lawn</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ) I asked them the question which started, you were the only man at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to say you were guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He stopped me at that point and said, I didn't say I was guilty, I said I was responsible." </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And for all the years I have been going over the nuances between guilt and responsibility and obviously there is a big difference and in Gidda Serany's(ph) book, she tries to, in a sense, come up with the answer as to why Speer did not get sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> the most amazing thing happened and it was a documentary the other night that covered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Every single one talked about how he did not know this had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Every single one said, well, no, yes he was doing his job, but all this was happening beside him. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Speer was the only man who admitted he knew something about it. "</span><span class="sentence" id="243">Speer was not," she says, "Speer was not, as 1s sometimes claimed, the only one of the accused at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to feel and admit to guilt," by the way, she uses the word guilt and I questioned her on that, "but his admission, even though much too generalized, was remarkable, because he was the only one, who by making it, risked fatally influencing the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> 's sentence, which for the others who accepted guilt, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg, Olendoff(ph) was inevitable." </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He was the only one who said he knew any of this was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He knew that slave labor was being used and in a sense, he was the only one then who stood apart from all of the others, because if you hear their excuses, I mean this is absolute insanity that these people claimed that nothing went on, when a man who was in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> didn't know what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , so that, whatever the reasons, he was always quick to say that he had not admitted guilt, but responsibility and I wrote a letter to the New York Times as you know, which covered that and it's always been a very key point in my feelings about Albert Speer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  How did you come to understand how he differentiated between the two? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Why did he stop you when you asked that question, say, "No, I didn't say guilt." </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I mean, what was the difference to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  The difference to him was that if he had said he was guilty, even at that point, even after the fact, then he was as guilty of doing it, or having a guilt for having done it as all of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">By saying responsible, he was one of the people who had it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I think there's just that thin level. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">In other words, I see it as very much the same, if you want to know the truth, but 1t was this very thin level that I think he felt, in his own mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">The problems that I had with Albert Speer and I must give Gidda Serany(ph) for her book is that she spent four years with him, I spent 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">When I left, and we'll go back to the other things later, but when I left, he asked my client how she thought we had done and she said, "Well, Mel's interviewed before and I think we got everything and as you know, we were out to do a series of short films which would be put in the Huntington-Hartford museum." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And he said, "It's a funny thing about Mel," he said, "he hides everything he feels behind a sense of humor." </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I said, "Would you like to feel my feeling about Albert Speer?" </span><span class="sentence" id="257">She said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I said, "He hides everything he feels behind 20 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="259">This man had had 20 years to come up with all the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You talked about Hitler and the Jews, Hitler hated the Jews, you talked about anything about slave labor, he had all of the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He had written his book, I saw the original manuscript, which was written on tiny scraps of paper about three inches wide and jagged edges. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Wherever he could get paper he wrote this entire book. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I know also that the book was changed substantially when it came from German to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He had the 20 years, he knew he would be talked to after he got out and he was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I did, if I, was I able to break him down at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Very interesting time, only once did I ever ... End of Side 1, Tape 1
ANSWER:  Yes, was there a time, is this running? </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Yeah, it's running. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Was there a time that I felt I had gotten to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I asked him what I thought was a very offhanded question, I said, "How often did your wife visit you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And he said, "Once a month." </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I said, "And how often did your children visit you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And he said, "Once every six months." </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I said, "What did you talk about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that is the only time I saw emotion on that man, he started to tear, I could actually see an emotional reaction and he said, "What do you talk about with someone you love," and 1t may be on the tapes that I, "what do you talk about with someone you love when you see them only once a month for a few hours or once in six months, once a year or six months for a few hours?" </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Other than that the man had, he was gracious, he answered all the questions, his English as you know, was excellent and then we had some interesting experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We went through the questions and later we cut the little , we had some interesting experiences, one afternoon he said, "I would like to show you some of my home movies" and I said, "Oh, how marvelous Herr Speer, let's go in and look at some home movies." </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And so we went into his <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , it was a rather nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by the way, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ), it was a <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> and they'd had for I guess many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The only problem with it was when there was a storm over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> used to come over and circle and you couldn't record. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But aside from that we sat on the <span class="DLF">lawn</span> with the birds chirping and we went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and we went to look at the home movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And he showed me the home movies of Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler inspecting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tiger tanks</span> on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I was a little startled be this because I mean home movies are home movies but this 1s watching his trip with Hitler to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Later he said, "Would you like to see some of Adolf Hitler's drawings?" </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And this was toward the end of the visit, we went to <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and again he took out all these drawings. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Hitler was a terrible artist by the way, terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The drawings, and a fascinating thing happened, which kind of leaps forward, Alma decided that she would take the drawings back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and put them up on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> during the exhibition at the Huntington-Hartford Museum, which was then at <span class="DLF">59th Street</span> and Columbus Circle and that we would have a demonstration or an exhibition of Hitler's drawings. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So she arrived at <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy airport</span> , I had gone off without her and she arrived at <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy airport</span> , she tells me and customs, she was carrying them under her arm and Customs said to her, "What do you got there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She said, "Adolf Hitler's drawings." </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And they said, "Oh, we've had enough wiseguys like you," you know, and they passed her through. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But again, the drawings were shown at Huntington-Hartford Museum. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We also did a film which was not planned, that I wanted to do and I don't know where those films are, possibly McMillan(ph) has them, I don't know if McMillan(ph) still 1s the McMiullan(ph) it was then, but somebody must have those films. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But we did one film that for me was the most fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">His interviews were fine, I mean, I got as much as I thought I could get, but there was one that we did where he was really in his element. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I asked him, as Gidda Serany(ph) asked him, as many reporters asked him, how he could work with this monster, I mean how could you be a member of Hitler's group and work your way up and he came up with a very interesting answer and I guess in all fairness, you have to accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He said, "How would you feel if you were a 29 year old architect and the head of state had asked you to be his architect?" </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He said, "You're very proud of the head of state," he said, "remember, this is..." And this is all before the war really got under way, this was all in the early days and as a 29 year old, if you look at the people who follow the presidents, who follow the congresspeople, look at all your young people, some of them are really very arrogant. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I've seen people come in to an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and say, "Yeah I want a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> because I'm with Jimmy Carter's entourage." </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And they're 22 years old going on eight, you know and you can understand at 29 this man was suddenly recognized by the head of state. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So we went to the drawings that he had done and we did a film on architecture in a totalitarian society and I think the thing that amazed me 1s if I was startled by Hitler's drawings, which were so bad, I was even more startled by the scale of everything that goes on in a totalitarian society. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Going back to the demonstrations at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in the 30's, with the torchlights, and I did see that, that <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , it's an incredible <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Going back to the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , going back to everything they ever built, which was always larger than the person, everything that Speer designed, which was going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , right after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> won the war was on a scale that belies imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">For example, a dome which would be on the Unterdinlinden(ph) and would hold 100,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Just a dome. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And then the Unterdinlinden(ph) would now be made into a <span class="DLF">military avenue</span> of about 48 lanes wide, with cannon on each side. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Everything he showed me was totalitarian, was fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It's what Mussolini did, it's what Hitler would do and this man involved himself in things that were beyond imagination in terms of scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I mean a <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span> 's a <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span> , when you talk about a <span class="DLF">dome</span> , under which 100,000 people can stand comfortably, you're talking about a pretty big dome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  What was he like when he showed you these drawings, did you sense pride or perhaps a bit of embarrassment, what was he like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  He would not have taken the drawings out if it were embarrassing. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He took the drawings out with pride, he showed them with pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He showed them matter-of-factly. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Speer was a very matter- of-fact man with someone like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I remember him smiling occasionally, certainly, I remember him being warm, but he showed pride in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I mean, to show me Hitler's drawings, then he said Mel must have a curiosity to see Hitler's drawings, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So I would say there was no embarrassment about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Which gets back to that whole thing of guilt and responsibility doesn't it? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I didn't find any feeling that he was sorry for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I certainly would love to have had him say he was sorry they lost the war, but you, you'd never get this from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He was very withdrawn in that sense but very bright and all his answers were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I have not heard the tapes in a lot of years, you have, recently, I sent them down without hearing them and at some point I think I'd like to hear them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I'm sorry two tapes are missing because I don't know which two tapes are missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">If I find them, they'll go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But the 10 days went very comfortably, shall I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I remember another thing, I am a hugger, I mean you know, I am a toucher, I'm a hugger. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Well, I didn't hug him, but when we left, Margaretta was saying goodbye to the crew and she had really been a very nice woman, I mean you know, she wasn't, like my mother or my grandmother, she was a nice woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">She took care of the crew, she fed us, she was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">She said very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And so, impulsively I went to hug her and that's when I realized that this was really a job, I was hugging a rod of steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">This was no woman who was going to hug me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So whatever her feelings were about this Jewish producer, I don't know, but that was, that, I always remember, I can remember it vividly, I can remember where we were because it was kind of a slap in my face that, but I am impulsive that way and I hug people, I hug men I love, I hug women, I hug. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Because I like to touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He and I shook hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  What about the mood and also the eye contact, what was that like for you and how did you feel after a day, five, six hours of filming, how did you feel afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  That's a wonderful question because I think what I did is I think that after the day, I blanked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I did not do, I could not have spoken to you after the interviews as I'm speaking to you now, 20 some odd years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I hate to say it that way because you know, it was my job, I did it, people use that as an excuse, but it was a job and if I was going to do the job properly, I had to do it as a professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Otherwise I should not have taken the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And so how did I feel through the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I was interested, I was interested in what he had to say, the relationship was comfortable at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">At the end of the day I have, we went around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ), we went to dinners, we really never discussed it or if we discussed it I can't remember having discussed it in any depth now. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But all of the, the days were very comfortable days, the weather turned out to be great, it was June as I recall, the weather turned out to be great. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He was always very, very charming and I thought more about what questions I'd ask the next day but never did I ever feel like Gidda Serany(ph) did in four years in being able to break through some of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The man could not be broken through. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And whether he then eventually said or felt he was guilty as she says, he did not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Did I feel when I left there that they should have hanged him? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I feel it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I think he got away with murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">For whatever reasons, he got away with murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He was using slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">His excuses for that of course, if you've heard the tapes are you know, this was a war effort, he had nothing to do with the day to day things in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , he had to provide people so they could provide for the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He was a loyal German, which he should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I guess probably even after this, I'll think of things that will come back now that I didn't think of 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense of him having an inner struggle and perhaps say, being afraid of it almost and saying no, I still have to believe that what I did was okay, or did you have a sense of that going on inside of Albert Speer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Yeah, I would never know what was going on inside of Albert Speer, he had learned to control that and whether he did or not, I know that in future interviews, like in this latest book, he had learned to back off where he didn't want to answer and even if you pursued it, he would go only so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Did he have an inner turmoil? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I don't know, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I don't know if the man felt that he was sorry he was ever convicted, he was sorry they had ever lost, I have no idea and I would never know this of Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He handled himself very well in those interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He did what he was supposed to do, I did what I was supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">If I had to do it all over again, I probably would come up with even more driving questions than I did then because I know a lot more now than I did then and it's very difficult to go into an interview like that as a documentary film maker, having studied everything you can about it and still think that you've covered everything, you can't cover everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">There are the old, I should have, I could have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Why do you think he did the interview, or why did he do, beyond perhaps the obvious reasons, I mean the man didn't have to do interviews, but apparently he did them somewhat frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  I think that they, I think a part of it, well first I think Albert Speer did his interviews partially for the reasons that you kind of touched on a moment ago of being able to justify Albert Speer and his background and what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Partially because I think he was convinced that if you're going to sell the book and, I mean this is a very pragmatic reason, that you're going to sell your book and you're going to convince people to go buy a book of, the number, several, 600 pages or whatever it was, you have to do media tours, you have to do these interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I think his publisher had a lot to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I think the publisher both in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and McMillan(ph) here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> said if you're going to do this book, you are going to have to do interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And he did a series of interviews right after that for television and for radio and did them later on, there was a second book, which I was not involved whit and I know nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I had had just about enough at one point, but I think that was it and I do believe that there was a feeling that he was now being recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Remember Albert Speer also, if he'd been hanged, would have gone down with Goring and all the rest of them, that would have been it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Albert Speer came out at the end of 20 years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and had a chance to be rehabilitated, I don't know if it was that, but to at least to a person again, in the society and with enough clout in the society to be interviewed by the press, to ask his opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I don't think in that sense it's any different from any of the people who came up 1n post war Germany and were interviewed. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I think he also was grasping and groping to try to find his way back to his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I mentioned that the impression I got of his six children, all of whom were born before he went to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and therefore didn't see him for 20 years except twice a year, were very, very distant and almost isolated from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I never got the feeling while I was there, in 10 days that there was any great love, the kind of love you see, almost in a physical love, a touching or a kiss, I never saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Now that may be only the Germanic thing and he didn't want to show it, so it's hard to tell, it's like you never know the inside of a marriage, but that was the impression I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I got the impression also that the man who came out of one of the worst of the fascist dictatorships in the world had several children who were very left wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I'm sure this bothered him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Did you get any sense of sadness ever from him? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We sort of touched on that earlier, but I'd like to ask it again, about anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Perhaps about his family? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It was just what you're saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  That's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">If I were to put it, that's a marvelous question because I would say there was always a sense of sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I don't know whether the sadness was created by 20 years lost without the family, now back to the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">You have lost 20 years, you have come out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> and you've lost 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I never got the feeling of a sense of joy, a sense of freedom, a sense of release. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But you're saying that now, if I had to put it in my own word, I think there was, over the 10 days, a sense of sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Even and a sense of propriety, of a proper human being who, when he went to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , as I mentioned, was cordial, was pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But was never hi Joe, you know, how, nice to see you, ever, always proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Just as the suits, between the two of us, both of us wearing suits, were always proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We never called one another by first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We never touched more than a handshake. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I always had the underlying feeling of 1f had won I would be dead, but I pushed it aside, I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And interestingly enough, on the day to day discussions, it was just like speaking to you, it was fine, it was we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I mean he wasn't going to do anything to me and I wasn't going to strangle him and so we put that aside right at the beginning and we were going to try to get to the bottom of something to which we really never go to the bottom, bottom and never would and nobody ever will, about Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The closest one who got to it was Gidda Serany(ph) and even there you get very little of Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Course when he wanted, when he was annoyed or upset, he let her know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And she spent four years with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  What you've said to me before our interview began, you can't imagine spending four years with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Oh well, yeah, in speaking of Gidda Serany(ph) spending four years with Albert Speer, I am almost overwhelmed at the professionalism and the bulldog grit 1t must have taken to do this, in four years that, I could not have spent four years with Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Well, I'm also type A, so that, you know I, 10 days is quite enough, that's usually... The thing that she did that I could not do and that I think is critical to any, any journalist or any film maker who interviewed Albert Speer, has to realize that none of us could have done what she did, which was to question him and then move to the people he mentioned in his answers to find out if A, they were true, if B these people had seen them and remembered them as Albert Speer remembered them and then to go to the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> and find out if either one was telling the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">This takes a lot of time and a lot of, of, of digging and she did it and I admire the book as a result. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I mean the book is overwhelming and I've written to her as you know and I've gotten an answer and I would like to meet with her, in a shared experience, mine 10 days and hers four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I would like to find out how she could spend four years there, doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And in reading the book and I read it carefully, I'm back in the middle again, reading it carefully, I just quoted from page 167. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I'm fascinated by the fact, the determination and the fact that she kept up with this thing and questioned everything down the <span class="DLF">line</span> , including the wives and the children of some of the people who had been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eagle's Nest</span> and Bertasgarten(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="409">By the way, I did visit there when I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> and I, Bertasgarten(ph), Hitler's Eagle's Nest home, or his <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> , the <span class="DLF">Eagle's Nest</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertasgarten(ph</span> ), there they had destroyed the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> right below and the <span class="BUILDING">Eagle's Nest</span> was still there and I remember going through saying, well Hitler was here, you know, this is where Hitler was. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">That was kind of an unreal experience, this was speaking to the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But getting back to your, your said, did I see a sadness, I think yes, I think deeply there was, there was a sadness, there possibly was a feeling that people didn't quite understand why he had done some of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Witnesses saying if you were 29 and the head of state asked you to be his architect, it was, it was an experience I guess that any of us, particularly the Jewish boy from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> would always carry with me and I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And when I found the tapes, I could not believe, I didn't know what had happened to them and there are still two missing, I'm going to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I don't know where the films are, I would like to have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Actually, what I would like to have is the original, the uncut film. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The 10 minute cuts are nothing more than 10 minute cuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I would like to find the original film somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I don't know if that's possible, it's too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Film was probably destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  How did the experience and perhaps not even immediately, but meeting him, spending those 10 days with Albert Speer, how did that change your understanding of Nazi Germany? </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Or perhaps of one Nazi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Let's put it this way, I've never understood Nazi Germany, just as I have never understood, I have never understood the kind of destruction that went on in Nazi Germany, almost the engineers at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I can more easily understand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Biafra</span> , I can even understand <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> , I can understand <span class="COUNTRY">Nigeria</span> , I can understand tribal warfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I don't like it and I think it's horrendous, but I can understand this because people do react this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="425"><span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> is the classic example of the problems of 100 years back. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But when I look at Nazi Germany and I haven't changed my opinion there, I felt exactly the same way before and I feel exactly the same way now. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The anti-Semitism, anti- Semitism in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> I find difficult to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I find anti anything of a group or a race, difficult to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">But when you look at what Nazi Germany did, with something like, was it 600 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or places of death, when you look at the use of slave labor, when you look at the deliberate way in which they did this, I still don't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I had known people who left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who are not Jewish, because they understood that this was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they couldn't live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">If it happened in my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I have often said I probably would have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So has it changed, did it change my feeling about Albert Speer? </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Before I met Albert Speer, I had no real feeling of Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">He was a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I knew he was, in fact I knew him as the Minister of Armaments, I had forgotten that he was an architect, I then, as you begin to read you realize, yes, yes, yes, I know he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I had no feeling about him before. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My feeling about him now 1s a rather distant one. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I don't feel any great warmth toward, toward him and that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I still can't understand how and why he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">In terms of Nazism and what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I cannot for the life of me understand how any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , how the people in any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> could do what they did and how they did it and the methods in which they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">This is not meeting someone in war, it's not even the SS man killing an unarmed American soldier or an American soldier in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Melai(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="442">This is something that is beyond my understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So in that sense there's been no real change. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I still have difficulty when I go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I still have, I must admit this, I have difficulty in the following way. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I've had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on several, and this had nothing to do with the younger Germans because what happens to me is when I go to a <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel lobby</span> and I see people my age, I'll be 73 in August, when I see people my age sitting there in suits and drinking and having a great time, I mentally put SS on their lapels. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And I'm sorry, this is the way it is and I've spent a lot of time there and I don't have to like everything and I don't have to like everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I'm glad <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 's a democracy, I'm glad the east and west have gotten together. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I don't have to like going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I find myself very uncomfortable there, I find the German language very uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I mean this as honest as I can be with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I have not forgiven and I certainly don't forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And what I feel is that <span class="NPIP">places</span> like the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> must open everywhere and that the younger people particularly, must go there and must see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Because with the revisionists, remember, those of us who have met Albert Speer, those of us who have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> are going to be dead and then the revisionism is really going to start, how can you believe all those dead people? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And this is not far-fetched, this is what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And so all of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> are important because there are people like me who have not forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And it's not a matter of forgiving, I don't have to forgive, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I also don't have to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So I have not changed my feeling about Nazism and Albert Speer is a story that took place and if I can have offered something to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in the tapes, so much the better, that's good because I think that these memories have to be kept and I think that people have to be able to go there and hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Can listen to him and decide for themselves 1n <span class="NPIP">part</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  And compare it with the interview with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And listen and decide and read the books and thank goodness for the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And interestingly enough I find that these books are now starting to come out so many years later, I would have expected they would have been 10 or 20 years before. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Of the new Goldhagen(ph) book which talks about the guilt of all of the normal Germans, the people who used to go and watch executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">But you know, that's interesting, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Let me not just take off on that because there are parallels. _</span><span class="sentence" id="469">Timmerman(ph) in his book and the torture that he underwent in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> has a horrifying discussion with his torturer, who does his torture as a normal job, then says to Timmerman(ph) after the torture, "Listen, my son wants to get into <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , do you know somebody who can get him into <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So if we talk about the banality of evil, you know, Hannah Arons(ph) great statement, this happens in a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span> , there are torturers and was I any different when I watched the hangman and I went away with no feeling about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So people are capable of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But nobody has ever done it on the scale of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Nobody has ever actually built <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> to put people in, had collected hair and has collected teeth and has collected shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And has had this virulent anti-Semitism, that is bad enough in the world as it is, but has done something like that that is inconceivable. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So I don't have to forgive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I also don't have to like them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  I hear you talking, it's almost like a visceral thing inside of you, it's not necessarily something you've, I mean obviously you've thought about it, but it's, you're talking about a visceral reaction for instance, when you're in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Absolutely it's visceral, I mean, the intellectual, let me give you an intellectual thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Intellectually I would say, well yes, you know, after all it is that time, there is a new generation, which there is and there were good people and there were bad people and it's done and gone and I can't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Of course it's visceral. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It's visceral also because I, I see the stirrings in other <span class="NPIP">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I see the stirrings out in, with the Michigan Militia, I see the stirrings with the anti-Semitism that's come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I see the stirrings with a presidential candidate who is anti-Semitic, whether you like it or not, he can say he's not and he has Jewish people on his staff, he's anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">If you see these stirrings as a Jew, you always are aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">You're always careful, that this is something that can affect you, this is something that can kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And so my only reaction can be visceral. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Because we have the antennas out, as the Blacks, the African-Americans have their antennas out to everything that's done, whether it's getting, can't get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> cause they pass you by, to the anti-Black statements that are made. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">You always have your antenna out as an African-American. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Well you always have your antenna out as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And so my reaction to an Albert Speer or my reaction to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is totally visceral. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And I'd be lying if I said that well I, you know I have to be intellectual about it now, I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But as I said to someone, I was interviewed on a travel show once, I had done a travel book and I've done a lot of travel films and somebody said to me, "What's your favorite <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I said, "<span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I love to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> for five years." </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And he said, "And which <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> don't you like?" </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I said, "Well I don't think it's up to me to tell you on this program which <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> I don't like." </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I never did on the program, but the point is, having worked in 60 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , I can like 59, I don't have to like all 60 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and that may be very unintellectual, it may be very visceral, that's how I feel and I think I've got to remember that and I want the Holocaust Museums to make people remember what these people did, even if they're all dead, that it can happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Are you glad you interviewed Albert Speer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Wouldn't have missed it for the world, even though I turned it down the first time, I mean, oh of course, I'm, 1t was another part of the experience you have as a film maker, it's another part of the experience you have as a documentary film maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It's the kind of thing where people say, "Oh you've led a very exciting life." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I say, "Well it's not over yet, you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And we're going to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> next year on a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But yes, it's, I'm glad I met Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I'm glad that I have worked in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where there have been dictators, not quite as bad as Hitler, but where I have been able to see first hand what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Whether I got anything more out of my visceral feeling since Albert Speer? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Not really, but that was a part of the experience and I am very glad that I went over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  Do you think that he had sat across from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> very often with Jews and answered questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Possibly some reporters, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He knew I was Jewish, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I mean if he didn't know, somewhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span> I'm sure I told him about my Bar Mitzvah, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">But I have a way of letting, but he knew and he knew Alma was Jewish, so he had in essence a Jewish client and a Jewish producer. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">The rest of the crew were all American and German and Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But yes, I, I, I think, I think that he had at some point, I don't think at this point it made any difference to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">You know, we did not come on as Jews if there were other reporters who did interview him, but at the same time, deep in my gut was always the feeling that I am Jewish and this man was number two in Hitler's staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Did you ever feel any responsibility in terms of representing Jews when you were sitting there asking questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  No, I don't think I represented Judaism, you know, I, it's a good question, no, no I don't think I did and I don't think it was there, you know, you're, I would say that, at this point I look at it and say, yeah it's kind of interesting that a Jewish producer was sent to interview this man who had used slave labor and who would have been dead if he'd won, I, we go back to that whole thing that sent me over in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But I never represent, I can't represent Judaism, Judaism is diverse, as diverse as, as any of the religions, so and I'm sure there are Jews, cause I read there are Jews who have forgiven at this point, say we must move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And whether that's there way of handling it or not, that's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">My way of handling is that we never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Did you like anything about Albert Speer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Did I like anything about Albert Speer? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I, that's a wonderful question in that I can't think of anything I liked as a very positive thing, but I can't think of anything I disliked. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He was, as I say, comfortable with me, at least outwardly. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He was a gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">He was a very gracious host. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I mean we wanted for nothing while we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He did take us through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He answered the questions, he never balked. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I didn't dislike anything, he was one of the easiest interviews in the sense of a day to day relationship over a period of 10 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">What did I like? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I can't think of anything that I would say I really, you know I really liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">No one's ever asked me that question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Do you think you learned anything from him? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I mean, 10 days is a long time, you often go away from an interview with something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  What I think I learned is that a great many people in my generation were not at all sorry for what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The reaction that these people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I mean I was fairly aware of it before then, having worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> several times and having lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, that the people of my generation were not at all sorry that it happened, were not at all guilty about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Maintained and retained many of their feelings, probably anti-Semitic and so on, about the Jews, about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I learned also first hand, that the younger generation, for the most part seem to reject that. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They may not want to hear about it, but they seem to reject it. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The fact that the word got around that we were quote friends of Albert Speer and they'd walk out, meant that that there was their visceral reaction to somebody who was there as a quote friend of a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So that even in my mind I have a great division where I go right down the <span class="DLF">line</span> and say there is a whole group that I have, I may not like listening to their German because it reminds me of that time, but I don't hold them responsible for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I find that I have difficulty even today, meeting people of my generation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or who are Germans and are traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I get the gut feeling, over and over again when I go a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like the Algove(ph) or I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and I see groups of Germans traveling, of my age, I get the immediate feeling and I must admit this, that while the Jews lie in their <span class="DLF">graves</span> , there's a Jewish term for that, they are out enjoying themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I still have that feeling and I resent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Not my feeling, I resent their enjoying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  What's the Jewish term?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Liktendred(ph), lies in, lies in, in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">While the Jews liktendred(ph) and I, that's the feeling I get, it's the feeling I have wherever I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I must tell you, in terms of my emotional feeling, if I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and there are groups of German tourists come in to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , my stomach knots. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Now that's, you talk about visceral, I have no intellectual feeling about it any more, I should actually pay no attention to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So I am in that sense very deeply a Jew and very deeply involved with what happened in the Holocaust and very deeply involved with what the Nazi's did and don't ever want to see it happen again to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But I still, if I, I have a job coming up where I may have to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I would like, frankly to have that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> dropped from the group that we're going to and it won't be and I will be a good professional film maker again and I will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">It has nothing to do with boosting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or anything, it just happens to be a business thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But I have that feeling and I make no excuses for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  It's a powerful feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  Well it's, 1t comes out as you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  I mean it's not a feeling that was given particularly by your family, it really came out of your experience as a young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Yeah, I think it comes deeper than experience as a young man, I think it comes from I am convinced that there is an ethnic depth in people. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I'll give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">When I hear Middle Eastern music and this includes Arabic, Israeli, any Middle Eastern music or Russian music, something deep within me comes to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Good feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I mean I happen to be one who can't understand why the Arabs and the Jews fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There is a very deep, Middle Eastern, ethnic level there so that I think, my wife Cheryl has the same feeling, I'm not the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Or she'll look at me and all of a sudden I stiffen with pleasure because the music gets to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Now that didn't come from my background as a child and it didn't come from what my parents taught me because except for my Bar Mitzvah, I really was not a very good Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So there is an instinctive Judaism there, don't ask me to explain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I actually haven't asked you anything about this and I think there's probably some things you can say about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">What sense did you get of Speer's relationship with Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  Very close, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">All the photographs, all the photographs that he has, all of the memorabilia, his home movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I had a feeling that Speer, although I notice Gidda Serany(ph) says at the beginning was not part of the inner circle, I got a feeling that he was very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I have a feeling that he respected the man as the leader of his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I believe he always did and I don't believe he ever changed his mind, through the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  Even though in your tapes you do talk about that point where Albert Speer gets sick and he doesn't see Hitler for awhile and as he explains it, he's pulled out of his sphere of influence and then when he sees him again, something has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So even after that change, you don't think that he fundamentally changed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  No, I don't think he fundamentally changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I think this was the, this was the dynamics and I can't speak too you know, authentically, but I think it's the dynamics of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Remember this whole inner group were always close to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">You move out for awhile like in any corporate group and then you move in and you've got to work your way back in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I think he always respected Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I don't know how he felt at the end of the war, I don't know how he felt before he died but my feeling was that he was close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  He says in the interview that you did with him that he feels embarrassed, I think, he might have even said shame and he is very halting when he says this, at declaring his admiration for somebody who became such a monster. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So what's going on there, he's using the right terms for Hitler, he's calling him a monster, but he's also saying that he really cared deeply about this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  See, this is the point, when anyone interviews a man like Albert Speer. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Is he saying this because this is politically correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">That was a term that was not around then. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Is this the answer he expects me to have? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I mean suppose he said to me and this is only instinctive about his feeling about Hitler through the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Suppose he said to me, "Oh this man was a monster, I hated him at the end, I'm glad he was dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Do you think I could believe it for one minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Not when he was involved with the armaments almost right up until the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Not until he was the heir apparent, the heir apparent to Hitler if Hitler had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">No, I have a feeling that we're back to his coming up with the answers of 20 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">That's a feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">But then again, I'm a very prejudiced man about that whole thing, so you know, in...
QUESTION:  And you were there, you spent 10 days with him, so some of the information that you'd gather about him are feelings and nuances about ways he said things and his body language, that sort of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  Well the body language was pretty much the same throughout. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Almost rigid, comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Comfortable in his answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">As I say I think he thought about them through all that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But in terms of body language, look, he was, there was always the gap between us, let's face it, I mean remember, always the business suits with the ties. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I was doing my job and he was answering the best he had thought about answering through all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I think he had come up with the answers to every one of the questions that I asked him and possibly not what Gidda Serany(ph) did cause she really went in depth, but that any reporter coming there would have asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I found no great revelation in anything I read later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Did you understand Hitler any better after you'd done this 10 day interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">You know, I, it's, if, no I didn't understand Hitler any better and I don't think that I could have gotten that out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Probably is one of the world's great monsters, I put with him all the other people who were with him as just as monstrous. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It was not only Hitler, they had to go along with him, they knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I not only don't understand Hitler any better, I don't understand the virulence of the entire group around him, including Goebbels, including Goring, including VonShurack(ph), including all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">No, I said before I would never understand the Nazi movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Oh, I understand then, I know, understand what it did, I understand everything for after World War 1, I understand all of the things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I hear a great many of the things happening today. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">The populist thing about look what they did to you in the war and look what the corporations are doing to you, this was Hitler's whole schtick and I understand it after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I understand also the thing of uniforms and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I can even understand them forming the army, I can even understand them having a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">What I can't understand is what they did to 20 million people, deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  Did Albert Speer ever bring up some of the delicate questions himself in a way to sort of pre- empt you, perhaps bringing up the issue of what he knew about the Jews, what was happening to the Jews and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  No, as I recall, now remember this is recalling. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">As I recall what, the pattern was pretty well set in that unless there was a question he never really volunteered anything, except to bring me in to see Hitler's drawings and the architectural things and the home movies, these were volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">In terms of the answers to the questions, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Now I have not heard the tapes in a while, you'd have to hear that, I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I remember it being a pattern, I had my list and this is pretty much what we went to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  With the things he volunteered, just listening to you just say that right now I'm wondering, was he just trying to show you just another slightly different angle so that perhaps it being more three dimensional for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">What's your thoughts on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Well it's hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Again, I can't remember all the nuances of the time I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He was professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It's the best I can say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Did he say anything that surprised you? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Tape 2
QUESTION:  Was there a moment in the 10 days that Albert Speer caught you off guard, said something that surprised you, perhaps even did something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Not in terms, I don't remember anything, I'm sure there must have been some times and I'm sure that some of the questions, but you asked the question, the first thing that came to mind was something that has been made very available at this time and in fact I saw it not too long ago on a, on a documentary about the war, which had nothing to do with Albert Speer or Adolf Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And it had to do with the problems that came up in armaments during the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">The Germans were the first to develop <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet planes</span> , or to develop flyable <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet planes</span> , which would have totally destroyed the armada's of the allies, considering everything was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">prop plane</span> at the time, the flying fortresses and so on and the P38's and Hitler did not trust the jet engine, it had no propeller. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And therefore, up until the very end, he refused to let them use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">At the very end he let them use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">By that time though, Speer could not develop enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> to make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But there was a fascinating thing, it's like somebody developing the atomic bomb before us, so of all the things that he mentioned to me, that sticks in my mind as something that I had not heard of and now as I say, has become part of the historians, you know, the historians whole group of books and films and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But that to me, surprised me. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Other than that, in terms of the answers, remember I said my feeling was, through the entire time that he had come up, I could not come up with a question except asking what he said to his wife and his children, in the visits to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> , that he would not have thought of before. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">A very bright man, a very bright man. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Under some other form of government would have been a brilliant executive possibly, I can't say architect because I was never very impressed with his architecture as I was not impressed with Hitler's drawings, but was bright enough, was presentable enough, was articulate enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Certainly spoke English quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Could have been a really well known, great man in some other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But he never really, we never really threw one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">He never really threw me, I had my questions, I always had to keep my deep feelings buried, which I did and he in turn had thought of every single one of the answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Do you think that, do you think that what you were just mentioning, that he's very bright, he could have, he could have just been such a shining star in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , another government, do you think that might be part of where his sadness comes from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Possibly, that's something that you know, I can't, if it were me, if I felt that way, yeah, I would, I would say so, look at there but for the grace of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Just as I say, if he had won, I'd be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Or I'd be slave labor, yeah if he'd been, but he wasn't, he was a part of Hitler's entourage and he was very much, very much in favor with Hitler through most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He was a part of the inner circle, he was for a long time the second in command, if Hitler had died he would have gotten the, the, he would have been head of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It's a remarkable thing for a man who at that time was in his 30's and then 40's. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I asked him about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> you know, but basically I got the fairly standard answers, he, it fascinated me also, was I guess one of the other things, surprised I mentioned that he had showed me the original manuscript. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">If you could take pieces of torn out paper, just take about 600 pieces of skinny, torn out paper, no more than three inches, with a tiny Germanic hand written on it, then you'll know what the manuscript is, this whole stack of papers which he got out, I guess got out through Margaretta(ph), but that was the manuscript of his book. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So remember this, he was writing that book while he was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">The thing that also bothers me, I think, if I think about it, and you say you know, what were my real feelings about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Remember also that the book changed in context from the German to the American version. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">The whole section on anti- Semitism was toned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The whole, a whole, no, yes, well no, when you say after I did the interview, no, they, it was being done while I was doing the interview, that book was not out, I only saw the book in manuscript, but I had not seen the German version. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But the German version and the English version do not match, in several important <span class="NPIP">places</span> , because for the American audience, they felt they could not be as strong in some of the <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So now that gives you a kind of a suspicion, both about Albert Speer and the people who controlled the publication of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  You talk about how he sort of gave you what he wanted to, he'd thought these answers out and yet it seems that in a way, it's like his self portrait and that's revealing too, what he does want to say about himself, Albert Speer and what he doesn't, that while you were, you feel that you weren't able to puncture it too much, it's still a self portrait.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  Of course, this is what he wants you to think, this is what he wants you to feel, he certainly is not going to come out as a self proclaimed monster, which by the way I don't think he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">You see, yes he used slave labor and he may or may not have been anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Interestingly enough, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">He may have been one of those, those, apolitical people in terms of his anti-Semitism, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Certainly he was not one of the virulent ones, certainly he was not a Goebbels. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">On the other hand, he was a part of the hierarchy and you know, the responsibility is there, it's like the responsibility is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">When you have a doctor and the nurse is hostile to you, the doctor is responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Well it's the same thing here, he's responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I mean he was a top man in this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So yes, he wanted you to feel, as anyone does, a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He wants to present and to communicate to you how he, Albert Speer feels about it and come out looking pretty, at least fairly good, not as a monster. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Remember also, he was shrewd enough and he was smart enough not to get the death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And he had to maintain that too, he could not be one of the monsters that was put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  You talk about burying your own feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Was there a time after the interview, in the day or two after, leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or even a month or two later, when at some point the feelings surface and what was that like or, or did you basically just erase 1t somehow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  No, I never erased it and the feeling did surface and after leaving, as with any reporter or film maker, I would like to have had the 10 days again because there were <span class="NPIP">places</span> I think I was too kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">There were <span class="NPIP">places</span> I felt and still feel that my follow up was not strong enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">At the same time, it's now 20-20 hindsight, I now know a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">In fact if I were to see him again, I don't want to see him, he's dead, but if I were to see him again, I would have a lot more questions and a lot of them would come from research that's been done by people like Gidda Serany(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I didn't have it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Remember, he had just come out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> a few years before or a year or two before. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">That's another thing that we've got to keep in mind, he came out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , he was a prisoner, he came out, he's now with the family, he's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ) where half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> hates him and the other half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> puts the red carpet down. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He's with his family, he'd not seen Margaretta(ph) for, more than once a month for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">He'd not seen these kids who grew up without him, some of whom as I say I was sure was left, were left of center. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And so, coming out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> as any prisoner, aside from the horrendous things that were done by the Nazi regime, coming out as any prisoner, he had a lot to get used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And even getting used to sitting down at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a group of film makers and his wife and his children and having a dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Always at the head of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , very stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Very, very stiff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  Definitely, I think you've just used a few words, but that image comes across very clearly, this man, who was rigid and his whole body was controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You are showing, you're pulling out some pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  I, yes, I am pulling out the pictures, look at any of these. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Look at me, pointing my finger and look at him answering the questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Here you have an even better one, this 1s a picture of me with Albert Speer and Alma Trynor(ph) on the <span class="DLF">lawn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I should call it my Greek period, I had long sideburns and a black mustache, I had black hair then you notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Describe him __..
ANSWER:  And if I describe Albert Speer, if you talk about body language, the hand, he's sitting rather stiffly in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , leaning a little to the right, which is very typical, hands clasped, legs crossed, as my legs were crossed. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The difference in the two of us is that I have the whole type A finger up, pointing a finger and asking a question and he, with almost a little bit of suspicion on the question and that was very typical. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">These pictures are not at all unusual, this was very typical about the whole, well we didn't interview over 10 days, we interviewed I think six or seven days of the 10 days, we had to get to know him, we had to get to know the community, we had to talk about what we were going to talk about without giving away the questions and so we were I guess six days or seven days out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And the crew came in and we filmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But if you look at the photographs of him and if you look at any of the photographs of any of his interviews, the man was never relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  And actually it's different from the photographs you see of him before the end of the war because he looks very relaxed, often when he's with Hitler, if he's walking around showing some piece of architecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  Yes, but if he's going to have an image, if he's going to make this image, remember he no longer is Hitler's number two man, he's no longer on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , he's no longer doing the architecture or running the armaments program, which was a huge program, the man did a remarkable job, considering the fact he had slave labor, but the man did a remarkable job in picking <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> up from the ruins of most of the bombing and actually turning out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">He was a very, very effective bureaucrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  He clearly was very, very bright, the work he did and then even what he learned and studied when he was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Were you ever intimidated by him in that sense, in the intellectual sense of jousting about the truth with a man like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  No, I was never intimidated, but I think I knew all the time I spoke to him that I was going to get the answers that he had well prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I was never intimidated because basically you have to remember that deep, deep down, there was the anger and the gut feeling that he still was Hitler's number two man, that it was an experience and it was an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I never, never forgot the fact that I was a Jew speaking to Hitler's number two man on a very civilized kind of a <span class="DLF">lawn</span> , you know, going in to lunch or dinner in a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It's a very weird, surrealist feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But no, I never felt intimidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Nor was he the kind of man who intimidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Which is another point. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">A lot of it had to do with him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">He was not arrogant. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">We think of some, particularly when we see the movies with the Nazi arm bands and you think of the arrogance and the arrogance of the Gestapo and so on, this was not the kind of man he was and he may not have even been that during the war, but I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Just a moment ago we were talking about the emotion finally coming out, I don't know if it did at one point and we got sidetracked, I want to just come back to that question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  About his emotion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  No, your emotion finally coming out at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> or did it just?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  No, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I was very careful never to let that emotion out, I could not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  No, afterwards, afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Afterwards sure, it came out the moment I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It came out as I discussed it with other film makers, when I discussed how you handle a thing like this, was it handled properly, how do you handle a thing like this where if you set up as we said at the very beginning, the structure of a Jew from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> going to see Hitler's number two man. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And nobody can ever answer it, about the only thing everyone agrees with is that you have to keep your anger deep down, that you really can't, and as he said, I, I, I obviously must have been very funny at some point because if he said I hide everything I feel behind a sense of humor, he knows or knew what I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I mean let's not kid one another, he knew I was Jewish, he knew what I felt, he knew what I must have felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So if he said a thing like that, just as I said, he hid everything he feels behind 20 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We both were wearing the gloves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  And the mask.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  And the mask, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Which in a sense is not the best way to get an interview, it's easier to interview a doctor who's a neurosurgeon, ask him about brain surgery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  That's what I wanted to ask, I don't know if there's something we haven't touched on that we should say about the interview, about the tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  The tapes, there's nothing more I can say about the interview or the tapes, I would like to find the other two tapes, remembering that they also were accompanied by film and so it would be interesting to see at this point if one of the questions you asked about came off on film. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Was there any point where he showed any of this other reaction, emotion or whatever it may be, discomfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I would have to see the uncut film because even the cut film would only have the correct answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">But in seeing the uncut film you would know because we went on I don't know how many rolls or how many hours we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">In order to do 10, 10 minutes films, plus a film on the architecture in a totalitarian regime, which was 10 minutes, you're talking 100 minutes of finished film. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I don't recall what we shot, we must have had a truckload of film when we went back because we kept rolling through all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Today with videotape, it would be cheaper, but...
QUESTION:  Yeah _ didn't you have to stop for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Yes, well every time, every, one day when we were out there, we surveyed it for the first couple of days, it was perfect, the birds were chirping and the first day we were going to film, there was a storm over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , we didn't know this, all we knew is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet</span> came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Then another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet</span> came over, then another and you know that, that's it for tape and I kept stopping the tape and stopping the film and he said, "Oh," he said, "whenever there's a storm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> circle over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So for about two hours we had nothing but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> circling over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Fora film maker this is death, this is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Overall it's, look, it's been with me this many years, I still read about him, I still can't get enough about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">If I see him on television on some film about World War 2, I still sit up and take notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Having lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> nght after the war, I know the VonSay(ph) house, I was very involved with that whole <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">As a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there were, there were lots of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">In fact, to show how it works, when Cheryl first came over and to show my anger, we were living in Max Schmelling's(ph), Max Schmelling(ph) was a boxer, was a heavyweight boxer, who was the German champ, who was beaten by Joe Louis and in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and a woman came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We had just received a package from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> to supplement our GI rations, which were plentiful anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And there were lots of people there, there were lots of displaces persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">There were the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and we did know some DP's and we did go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and we were very involved with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And in radio, I was involved with the documentaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and a woman came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and Cheryl came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the woman said, "I'm hungry, is there something I can have to eat?" </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And I said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And Cheryl said, "You can't do that to somebody who is hungry." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And she went in and she got a can of salmon and she gave it to the woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And we had our first big married fight, because I was so angry that they had starved people, that they had put them in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , I mean I don't have to go through the whole litany, they had done all these things and she said you can't turn a woman who is hungry away. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So obviously then and obviously even to this day, my gut feeling 1s, I find it difficult to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I find it difficult to hear German spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I find it difficult to meet someone of my generation who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1940, '41, '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Can't help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So in that sense I've come away with a very, an even stronger emotional feeling and my speaking to Albert Speer is just one of those little bricks in that whole thing of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> how I feel today and I would do it again, as I said to you before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
