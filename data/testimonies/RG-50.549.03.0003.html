<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Yeah, that’s better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Prior to the liberation, we were locked in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were shut and they were supposed -- supposedly trying to kill us, but there was not enough time, they had to escape because the Russian forces closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And the sight through the locked shutters, we could see that the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> were empty, and the SS was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And this was the moment that we realized that they abandoned us. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And that was April the 26", I believe, of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Since I was badly hurt, my friends were holding me, and broke the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and ran to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , brought some margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We stuffed ourselves with the margarine, and we decided to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that the commandant used to live, with the garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">There were several of us, one girl had her mother with, and somebody brought two eggs and two potatoes, and at that moment the commandant came back with a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And we were frozen stiff looking at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And the poignant part was that he was afraid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we decided to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">March 16, 2001 My friends were helping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We went through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , there was a great deal of firework -- not firework, fire stemming from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They were being bombarded, and we ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We joined with two Polish men who worked there in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We reached the <span class="DLF">front line</span> and first -- we saw the first Russian, and this was the -- suppose our liberation - supposed liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Pretty soon we discovered that this was not the freedom that we were dreaming of. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Freedom was very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We thought of the normal -- normal life that will come of finding the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was very difficult period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Could you -- could you say a little bit more about sort of the first impressions of the -- the liberators that you had? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">What was the condition at the -- at the fe -- you -- you went to the actual <span class="DLF">front line</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It was actual <span class="DLF">front line</span> because the war was still going on and the shooting was on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">As a matter of fact, one of the girls was hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We just didn’t have time to look, we were running like an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The first Russian was of Asiatic origin because his face, the features were Asiatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And he was very dirty, I remember his big, black leather boots, filthy uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was the liberator, and we thought we should kiss his boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He told us -- he motioned to us to go back, and the Russians gave us help. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The help consisted of a barrel of herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And we ate the herring, and of course the -- we be-became very thirsty, there was no water, the pipes were broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And they told us to leave, my friends held me. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We reached the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the <span class="DLF">roof</span> was gone from the bombardments. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was very well prepared with food March 16, 2001 and sleeping equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We lay down -- we ate, we lay down, and the very same night, two Russians came, and raped two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So --

ANSWER:  I was --
QUESTION:  -- did you get medical attention, anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, you have to understand the circumstances, the Russians were fighting, 1t was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I didn’t see anything there of -- of nor-normal food ration, or even [indecipherable] Red -- Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But they had some bandages and they gave me the bandages and I was bandaged around my body to hold my ribs. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">That’s all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And when -- once we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , 1t was some sort of a <span class="DLF">trapdoor</span> going down, which I wasn’t familiar with before. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and one of the Russians was drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Wi -- he started to shoot at the jars which were lined on the shelves, and the pieces of -- pieces of the glass embedded in my left leg, and I was lying down on one of the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> , and I ask one of the Polish men, please protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I -- when the times will be normal, I will give you -- my -- my mother, my family will give you anything in the world if you will help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He covered me, and he sat down on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I was lying there and my leg was bleeding, but I didn’t make a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That was the night that two girls -- March 16, 2001 one was taken out, one was -- they blew the candle out and they raped her, and the other one came bloody back. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">This was my liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Very bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We wondered if this is -- 1-1f this was worth it, to survive to see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The next day we left for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The freedom was very bleak. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I was petrified of the Russians now. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, after a couple of days, next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to ours was occupied by the former French prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I talked the them and they decided that they will take me to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and protect me, and I stayed with them for quite awhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Now, after awhile then, things changed, people started moving back to their native <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Did you go to -- well is -- let me not ask as -- as such a question, what -- what happened after awhile then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Well naturally, I thought that my family survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I was unaware that everybody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So I wanted -- my first thought was going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And there were some Polish people with some sort of equipment that they were going towards <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they March 16, 2001 had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> , and they took me -- they had Polish flag, and we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lignitz</span> , I remember, and then -- the names escape me, but I know that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lignitz</span> , and we were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> big, and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was already organized, and people already had ration cards, and we slept in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we were assigned to. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But I still wanted to go to my native <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and there was -- there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> already, on one of the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , and I went with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , of course everything was without money and no possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">A human being is very strong, unbelievably strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , I was just standing there with nothing and I saw a man with a s -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and I ask him where he 1s going and he said he is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , which was my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I ask him if he will take me, and he agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And that’s how I reached it. </span><span class="sentence" id="101"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was completely destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">There was -- I -- I had uncle and aunt, but I couldn’t find the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Everything was in ruins. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So I was very glad that I was getting the ride, without money, which I didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He went -- we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , I believe and he went out to eat and he left me in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he came back, I think he brought a piece of bread, but I’m not too sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> and -- of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6dz</span> was not destroyed because it was occupied very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I tried to go to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was not let in. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The Polish people occupied our <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">March 16, 2001
QUESTION:  -- and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was still there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  All the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on our <span class="DLF">street</span> were absolutely in perfect condition, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6dz</span> was occupied by the Germans, I believe on September sixth, maybe fifth of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had only the first day of bombing and it was not destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was standing, and the so-called superintendent was still the same one. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And when he saw me, he thought that he -- that he saw a ghost. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He said in Polish, how come I survived, why did I come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">This was the greeting I have -- received. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">When I wanted to go upstairs to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Lédz place</span> , the people wouldn’t let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And I went down and the super said that the Germans own -- took everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The carpets, and whatever there was there, they took it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I went to -- two <span class="DLF">streets</span> further. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There was a -- some sort of a <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> that had information, people who came were putting down their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I looked through their list --

<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  My feeling about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The Germans started the war, the Germans were the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">However, Poles were my countrymen. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I grew up there, I loved the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I loved the literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I was, you may say patriotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I had Polish girlfriends, and I thought on coming back that I will meet some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I -- I was bitterly disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">That stems already from before, because when the war started, my friends didn’t come to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They could have in the beginning, before we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But not having family left, and not wanting to contact any of my Polish ex-friends, my -- my idea was to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> forever and ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I didn’t want to have anything to do with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>

feeling, it was like the history of the millennia came through my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I reminded myself that my grandfather had on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , some sort of a picture and there was saying, Oh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , if -- can’t quote it. </span><span class="sentence"

where the rock 1s, and this is allegedly the rock on which Abraham was supposed to sacrifice his son, and God stopped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I don’t know -- these were legends, but to me this was something that history repeated in all the hundreds and hundreds of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So I sort of became a little part of the history, touching the

ANSWER:  Nobody urged me. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I felt -- first of all, the family said, when we saw that we are doomed, that if someone survived, some -- that one should speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">There was no question about it in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I would not dream about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">In the beginning in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , my English wasn’t good enough, and it was absolutely negligent, I didn’t speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">When I learned and I became fairly fluent in English, the obligation started to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I said, I promised, I have to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And I started with some of my friends who were American born, and little by little 1t grew. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">People listen and they said, oh, you know, we have a group of women, this will be interesting to invite you. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And since I live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> , | did this for over 20 years here. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And I was always recommended. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I never put my name in the papers that people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">But -- especially the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They invited me three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And I said to the teacher, “But I’m repeating myself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They said, “What do you think we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We repeating our lessons, but each time 1s a different class, March 16, 2001 different people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So I fulfilled my promise and my obligation, and I never wanted to profit by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I did this because this is my absolute responsibility to the people who perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And if there are some individuals who do profit by it, ’'m sorry they do. ’'</span><span class="sentence" id="691">m happy that they do some good by speaking, but I feel that 1t’s almost unethical to profit by it in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">There is no glory in it, to -- to -- to be invited guest of honor here and there, and -- and have pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It -- 1t doesn’t apply to me.</span></p>
