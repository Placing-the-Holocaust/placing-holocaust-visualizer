<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  I wonder if you’d talk next about your motivations in becoming a Nuremberg prosecutor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I'd been with -- I’d written a senior paper during my last year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , concerning the structure of national socialism, as we knew it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And I read a few books, particularly by professors from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And the book got a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating, and so I had an early interest in the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and ‘34. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Then I went off to the London School of Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from Hitler, who -- with whom I became friends and went out to dinner with and parties and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So I got to form some friendships that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Then, of course, came the war and I was overseas for nearly [phone ringing]. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Well, what was I saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Oh you’d -- were at the London School of Economics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I saw the wedding of Herman Goering and Emma Sonamen on April 10, 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I traveled into the -- the ruhr, because I’d met a German young man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , who offered to show me the good hoffnoseeter and to stay overnight in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He did this knowing that I was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather re-reserved, because I don’t think they wanted to -- they didn’t want to take a chance of exposing themselves too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Anyway, I also went out one evening with -- somewhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , with the Reverend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later became the American pastor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He ra -- He later wrote the book, “It’s Your Souls We Want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And Stu Herman and I became lifelong friends, we’re still corresponding. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">After I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> for three years and my club won the moot court arguments, and the case was based on a -- a -- a labor case. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So when I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I went to the Labor Board and they hired me in a half an hour, based on the fact that I’d contributed to this brief, which was on a point that was being argued before the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So that started four years of trial work. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They used me as a trial lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Then came the war and in 1942, I enlisted and within a month was again back in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , as a sergeant and later a warrant officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for six months until the -- after the invasion of <span class="REGION">Africa</span> by the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I then went to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> , as administrative officer to the Inspector General. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">In that capacity we traveled all over <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> , inspecting American army installations. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I then -- An old friend of mine, Gerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of the German labor branch of the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, came to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> and asked me to come up and become the training officer for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">labor desk</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I had a hard time getting away from my boss, but I finally managed and for some six months I trained Germans who had fought on the -- for the Loyalists in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being trained to do parachute jumping, to do signals -- signal work so they could send out messages after they’d jumped into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Then I got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to come and become the training officer at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">central desk</span> of OSS -- a central <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> for labor and German operatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h- l-y, whom I’d known in <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> , saw me with my parachute wings and said, “You ha -- should come to work for the labor branch, helping us settle strikes and gathering labor for the short supply labor industries in the midwest.” </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I said, “I don’t think the OSS will release me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="31">His boss was Colonel Brennan, who later became a Supreme Court Justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Colonel Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was my top boss and later a member of the Supreme Court and convinced him that I should perform this service. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, while that went on, the war finally came to an end and I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law for the labor board. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">At that time, s -- r -- Justice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed to be the US Chief of Council for war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He made a statement which was released to the press on June second, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I was so struck by it’s -- not only it’s understanding of the w -- the way Hitler had come to power, but of it’s determination to see that the Nazi regime was exposed from beginning to end that it’s top leaders were brought to justice and to an explanation of why they had committed the evils they had committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I didn’t know how to get with Justice Jackson’s group, because I didn’t know him at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So I went back to OSS and my old fraternity brother, Robert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the three assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the head of OSS. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">General Wild Bill Donovan. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I had told him my dilemma, and he says, “Well, we can take care of that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So we went down to see the general council of OSS, who is another Donovan, a James Donovan. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And Jim Donovan hired me within a half hour and for the next month or so, I busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS reports on Nazi Germany, and they were terrific and very well done. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And a professor by the name of Noiman had written a book on Nazi Germany -- just a second -- Noiman had written a book called, “Behemoth” and I studied that in some detail and then went in to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I told him of my background and he said, “Well, I -- Of course you’re interested in the destruction of the trade unions by the Nazis.” </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He reached back and pulled out a German book that had been obtained by OSS through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And, an appendix in that German book contained the order of Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> who committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And Robert Ley had written this order on how the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS were to take over the trade unions. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Well, this gave me the basis for not only a brief and for a -- an eventual presentation to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> , it also gave me leads to labor leader with whom OSS was in touch, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and some of them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then went into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to visit some of these trade union leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I got affidavits from all of them and those affidavits were all introduced in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> -- first Nuremberg trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Neither one of the affiants was cross- examined by the defense, they didn’t question at all the -- the horrors that surrounded that particular aspect of the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The result was that that made some impression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson, Colonel Robert G. Storey, who later became head of the American Bar Association, he was quite impressed by this work and said, “You must make some -- a presentation to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> ,” which of course delighted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And he assigned me the case of a Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who later became the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Let me interrupt to ask a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Do you think that had you not sort of pushed yourself forward, you would ever have been approached to play a role? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You s -- You were peculiarly fitted, I think, but I wondered if it’s because you were aware of that fit and felt at once, very strongly, that this was something you wanted to be involved in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yes, as soon as I heard Justice Jack -- read Justice Jackson’s report, I knew there was where Sprecher should next go. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And so I’d determined to get there one way or the other, and it turned out to be a relatively easy path.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  I also want to go back to what we talked about before, really, your motivations, but in becoming involved, did you feel that you had something personal you wanted to achieve? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I don’t mean for the sake of your personal ego or career, but did you feel passionately about what this prosecution was going to achieve?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  I felt passionately about what the prosecution could achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  And then, what did -- what do you feel the Nuremberg trial -- what do you feel the effect was on you later? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The -- Y-Your own writings bear testimony to what happened, but if we move forward, how do you look back on it and do you feel that it’s been evolving over many years, the impact?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  The impact of the Nuremberg trial on American public opinion was considerable for approximately one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And then, with the coming of the -- after the war, with the coming of the Cold War, American opinion and the journalists and so on, turned very rapidly toward discussions of the Cold War and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials were very much played down and not talked up for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I turned away to other things here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and then got involved in some business affairs and then got into Behavioral Science and teaching at <span class="BUILDING">George Washington University</span> in Behavioral Science, which is a new <span class="DLF">field</span> for me, but I really worked hard to get there and a couple of professors were kind of pushing me to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And then I began to get interested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> again, particularly after I th -- more or less retired, although I -- I didn’t completely retire from training and consulting. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But I slowed down a lot and I started to first work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had particularly prosecuted, I’d made the principal presentation against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Then I decided I’d switch to something which was talked more about and that was Julius Streicher, the top Jew baiter of all time. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But then, a lot was written about him, and so I started to move toward the idea of seeing if I couldn’t contribute something different by writing the most elaborate book, the most comprehensive book on the Nuremberg trials, one which would agree with most of the conclusions that many other writers have made, but which would go beyond that, into the depth of the evidence, and particularly quotations from the contemporaneous documents and from the testimony of the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> -- 21 defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The consequence was that I finally developed a huge book, far too long for publication. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was rejected by a number of commercial presses as being financially unbearable with it’s length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I then started approaching university presses and they all insisted that the book should be reduced somewhat in size, so it’d fit into two volumes, rather than three. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And so I spent a couple of years doing the difficult task of condensing. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And finally, the university press of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , based on all the commendations that I had and their own scholarly research, decided that the book did have a special role to play and so I’m -- was very glad to sign a contract with them and my book will be published in late December -- or late No-November or early December.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  And of course the length publishers want has nothing to do with the value of something to posterity. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You know, your material and work is there to be handed on, in full length.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Yes, that’s what distinguishes the book mainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I don’t attempt to be the final preacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to make the account of the trial available, so that many scholars and a lot of others that are r-really interested and willing to spend some time, can really delve into the contemporaneous documents and particularly into the motivations of the defendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It’s so false for people to think of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in terms of defendants saying, “I was following superior orders.” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">These defendants worked for years for the Nazis and superior orders defense applies mainly to lower people in the -- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and shoot somebody or to commit some atrocious crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The people at the top give their loyalties to a regime over a period of time, and they do it for many different reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It has little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Most of the enthusiastically worked for the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Some of them, of course, had great reservations and some of them wept as they gave their testimony, being very sorry indeed, for having associated themselves with such an evil course of conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  When you talked of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and the fact that it was only for a year that 1t was extensively covered in the American press, I -- I’d like you to say more about that, because I’m sure you feel that the very holding of the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> was immensely important in documenting what had gone on. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I -- I was just reading about Benjamin Firense a-as just one small example of somebody gathering evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But I’m sure we gained immensely through -- in many ways, through holding the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes, Professor Firense came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and when he find -- found out about the Einsatzgruppen, he immediately started to make some proposals to General Telford Taylor about his leading that -- the case against the main leaders of the Einsatzgruppen, the special task forces which killed millions -- a couple million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he did this with great ability and aplomb and he presented the case almost entirely with documents in an -- less than a day and one half. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The case went on for months after that, by the defense, but the prosecutions case, in the shortest Nuremberg case of all -- the short -- the shortest case of the prosecution, was the one conducted by Firense. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I became the head of several divisions, the subsequent proceedings division, economics division, chief of the I. G. Farben trial team, and later, deputy chief council in charge of the official publications. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">At -- Firense had been offered the job, by Telford Taylor, of being director of publications. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He turned it down in order to become head of the Jewish successor restitution organization and he recovered from German firms tha- who had employed slave labor and who’d taken property from Jews, he recovered vast quantities of money for the people involved at -- the survivors of the -- of the people that were involved or the -- some of the people who still survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And to this day, he’s one of my best friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  What -- You’re in touch with a number of people whose experience was somewhat simu -- similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You mentioned for instance, a -- as a good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Have you talked with these colleagues about the impact or the effect of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> on your lives, and is there any similarity, sort of commonality of experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  I’ve talked to almost all the survivors, in fact, I was the chairman of the executive committee that put on three Nuremberg reunions, beginning in 1979, nine -- then another 1991 and one in 1996 at the -- more or less at the 50th anniversary of the end of the first Nuremberg trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I’m in touch with almost all these prosecutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I’ve sent them chapters from my forthcoming book. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I’ve asked for their criticisms and their comments. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I don’t think anybody surviving knows as much about the people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> than -- than I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I don’t think so, because of my continued work on this subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I have constantly wanted to be in touch with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  And what do you think the impact has been? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Has it colored everything that you’ ve done subsequently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I -- You don’t do anything as significant as the Nuremberg trial was, in reviewing a modern dictatorship, without that having a tremendous effect emotionally, on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I think the importance of the trial is much more on what it revealed than in the fact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitted three. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The effect of the trial later on, was very mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">For some years, it had very little effect, and then as war crimes were committed in ce-<span class="REGION">central Europe</span> , particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and then later in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , world attention turned much more to what international law was, that international law was being violated, and that there was no established structure to deal with these crimes, and that no <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So then you started to get the foundation laid and an international treaty signed to create the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, and later on the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> also created the <span class="BUILDING">Rwanda tribunal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The <span class="BUILDING">Rwanda tribunal</span> has had a great number of difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was poorly staffed, poorly financed and was not well taken -- it was not well administrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">On the contrary, I think the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal are very promising. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They do not have the number of contemporaneous documents or the great amount of contemporaneous documents which we had in the Nuremberg trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">This means they have to rely much more on investigations and interrogating witnesses and that’s a much more difficult job to do when you don’t have all the knowledge that we had about the detailed operation of the Nazi regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  What are the main shortcomings of these later tribunals?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  International opinion does not regard them as essential to scoring the up events and il-illuminating the background and the nature what went on in the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> that led to some of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They aren’t international opinion on the whole, is not in the same position of knowledge with respect to what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And you don’t have the same push, the same public demand. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And the tremendous number of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> are so troubled by their own internal problems that they have not pushed the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> or the established tribunal to do more, more quickly, and they haven’t given it as much funding and -- as they should. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">There are some very able people that have gone into the leadership of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and I wish them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I think that they are going to make a -- a big contribution in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  I wonder if you’d talk about areas of involvement in your life later, that you see as having a direct involvement with your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I was asked to make a number of speeches at conferences of one kind and another and of course I was instrumental with health and my wife and others in putting on these three Nuremberg reunions. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And this took up a lot of time and -- it meant that, however, that we were able to call back my former associates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and keep in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="129"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> is not something that wears out of your life with time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It -- It becomes a -- an <span class="REGION">area</span> where you think about it at night and you think about it in the morning and you wonder what can the world do, what can -- how can public opinion be advanced so that they’re willing to reduce the rights of national sovereignty to a greater extent and to make the international law really international and enforceable by international agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">There are a tremendous number of isolationists and people who raise their hands and say, “We don’t want any foreigners in a position where they can possibly judge Americans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There’s a certain appeal in that for citizens who are not too well informed, and it’s regrettable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Do you think there are grounds for optimism though? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Do you feel things are getting better or getting worse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  No, I think things are getting somewhat better. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I don’t think the pace 1s nearly as great as it should be and certainly not as great as I would like to have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  And how can we change people’s attitudes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  By more education in international affairs at a younger age, for younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">By having more of the -- the books that have been written on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> circulated more widely, building up interest in -- in a broader public education, so that people are more aware of -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Drexel Sprecher. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">This is tape number one, side B. Do you think your trips that you made as a young man to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , | think it was 1929 - 1934, was that a part of the forming of your own internationalism, if you like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Oh yes indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The fact that I studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and I met many refugees from Hitler, that I traveled into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> while Hitler was in -- in power, in 1934 and 1935, the fact that I worked with anti-Nazi Germans in the Office of Strategic Service, just left an -- an indelible imprint on my -- my whole life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  What about the imprint left by your parent’s values? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">What you had absorbed from them or been taught by them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  It had very little influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I came from a middle class, lower upper class, small town family. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My father was a banker. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He’d been president of the Wisconsin Bar Association and I don’t think he paid very much attention to the Nazi regime until I began to become active in my thinking about the Nazi regime and told him something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He was certainly never sympathetic to the Nazi regime that I know of, but he was not active with respect to international affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Now, he did have -- your parents did have religious views, so would you not have perhaps had a strong moral sense that you would have absorbed from them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Well, you touch on a very important point, not so much because of the moral values that my parents had, but they sent me to a small <span class="BUILDING">college</span> my first year, <span class="BUILDING">North Central College</span> , and there I met a minister by the name of Ralph Marion Holdiman, who was a very active Christian Socialist and his ethical values were very stretched into the <span class="REGION">political area</span> and by the time I was done with that first year away at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I was -- I was beginning to see the roots of Fascism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and of course then, when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> , Hitler came to power during my junior year, and a number of professors played this up as one might expect, because it was certainly a tremendously forbidding development in international affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">One of my professors was Selac Perlman, who was the chief historian of labor developments in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And I can remember one day in a seminar that he burst into tears as someone mentioned what was happening in Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And it was a very moving moment and I can still remember it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Max Carl Otto was a -- an American of German descent who was very anti-Nazi and he was also one of my heroes at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I was asked to run the conference on war at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> , shortly after Hitler came to power, and we gathered leaders, including people from <span class="BUILDING">military academies</span> and professors from both <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> and other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , some ministers, like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred W. Swan and others and they made talks and there was questions by the students and there were some demonstrations about how important the whole thing was, by some of the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And that put me on the bandwagon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  And it does seem as if the early years have those strands, if you like, that become a theme throughout your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I’m thinking of the group you were involved in as a student, Coinose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Coinose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Oh then, I wonder if you’d tell the story too, of Beverly, that you mentioned once.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Oh it -- I -- I made a number of f-friends at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> , who had strong ethical feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Catholics, Protestants and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And a number of us got together and got the idea that if we held a number of meetings, it might help make a contribution to fighting this -- this racism and contribute to the broader education of students. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">One of them was Beverly Rabinoff, who was a Badger Beauty. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She was one of the five women elected to that noble category because of her good looks. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There were an -- a number of other people, George Dugger, Bill Blaiser, who were Aryans who were very active in this movement and we called it, “In Common,” which was from the Greek word meaning in common -- coinose. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We held meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We didn’t allow people to join Coinose unless they had at least a B average and unless they’d done something on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Well that made it kind of a distinct group and people kind of looked at us in a different way than if we’d just said, “Hey, everybody can join Coinose.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And it turned out to be a very useful thing, they got a ver -- very great amount attention, including by the president of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  But you -- What it was -- after, I remember you talking about including Beverly in a -- I think it was a fraternity dance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There was quite a bit of segregation at the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> back in the 1930’s and there were Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish sororities and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And the -- there was very little mixing of -- inside the frater -- the sorority or <span class="BUILDING">fraternity houses</span> of Jews and Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So Beverly Rabinoff, being a good friend of mine, I said to her one day, “Beverly, ve been asked to go to the Tri-Delt House,” -- the -- one of the sororities, “for a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And I’m wondering if you would like to be my guest?” </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And she said, “Oh, that’ll upset things a great deal.” </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And I said, “Well, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">After all, you’re a Badger Beauty, and if you go in there, we’ll cause- with me -- we’ll cause quite a sensation.” </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So we ap -- walked into the <span class="BUILDING">sorority house</span> at the time of that party and people’s jaws dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">However, within minutes, everybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabinoff. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">All the men wanted to dance with her and I was left alone throughout most of the evening while other people danced with Beverly Rabinoff. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So that was a small contribution to integration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Do you have a lot of other examples like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Well, in my <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> , which had no Jews, Phi Gamma Delta, I got el -- Edward Ellsworth Ross, who was a former Phi Gam to come and talk and I urged him to talk about the segregation problem and things like that, which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And so there was some things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The dean of students, a fellow by the name of Holt, H-o-I-t, his son was in our <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and -- and the overall dean was Scott Goodenite. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Bill Blaiser, who was the head of the student union, and I, went up to see him and told him that we were about to try something, that we wanted him to know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Some Jews had gone onto the <span class="DLF">pier</span> that stuck out into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Mindoda</span> , of one of the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity houses</span> -- I forget the name of it right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And a fellow by the name of Max Knecht, K-n-e-c-h-t, who was the boxing champion of the big 10, went out with a couple of his fraternity brothers and threw these Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And this, of course, made a lot of newspaper publicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Blaiser -- Bill Blaiser and I didn’t want it to die at that point, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goodenite</span> and said, “We’re going down to see --” Blaiser was over six feet tall and so was I, and together we weren’t too afraid of Max Knecht. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So we went down to the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> and asked to see him and he blustered out and said, “What are you liberals doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We said, “We’ve come to tell you that if you were to repeat what you did before, we can give you the straight word that you’d be ostracized from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and that we would gather a group of people and throw you in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> just to show that we wouldn’t take this kind of thing any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he said, “Rrrr,” and turned around, banged the <span class="DLF">door</span> and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But Max Knecht never threw any more Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Now, you said that he was calling you a liberal, but what was your family background, liberal or very conservative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Very conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And -- But they didn’t have any strong pred -- prejudices about race, as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We only had two Jewish families in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I lived in and both of them patronized my father’s <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And I bought my shoes there and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  What about your own politics and the way in which your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> experience might have colored that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Well, I became very active in politics after I returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Up to that time, I had been an active Democrat in the sense of making a few contributions to the Democratic party and congressional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn’t been very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , my wife was also an active Democrat and I settled out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland area</span> , which 1s largely an area of relatively wealthy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And a lot of brainy people, a lot of intellectuals who had done well. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So we formed -- I became precinct chairman and we also formed a -- a group out there, which was calculated to give talks about -- in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and otherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so forth and the local pastors were all for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Reverend Gloid Alice in the <span class="BUILDING">Methodist church</span> was one of our great supporters and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So, yes, this did have an e-effect and I went down to the <span class="DLF">hill</span> with the idea of becoming an assistant to somebody that was helping on small business affairs, since I was running a couple of small businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">A <span class="BUILDING">land development company</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">construction company</span> out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And I met Senator Sparkman, head of the Senate small business committee, and Rite Patman, the head of the House small business committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I went in to s -- They said I should go see Paul Butler, the national chairman of the Democratic party and I did and he established the small business division of the Democrat national committee, which was composed of me and my secretary, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And we developed a lot of literature, which was broadly circulated to the state parties, county and local people, concerning small business issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So that was my first move, actively into politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">About a year later, after the 1956 election, I was back to doing what I had been doing before, someone said -- Paul Butler, the national chairman, was forming a new s-structures to the Democratic national committee, which was going to pull together the political organization and build up more <span class="REGION">precincts</span> and ex-extend the amount of public relations that the national committee was going to have with the local organizations between elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So I went in to see Paul Butler and he immediately said, “Well, I’d like to hire you, but I have to consult with the advisory committee on political organization.” </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So I flew out to <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> to see former congressman, Neal Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state chairman of the Democratic party in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And he introduced me to the Michigan leaders, and we sat down and had a dinner together and they queried me and they came back with the recommendation that I be made deputy chairman of the national committee -- deputy chairman for political organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And we then hired a total of six regional representatives, each one of whom had six to eight states, and he -- they traveled around, building up ideas of better Democratic organization, and not trying to be pushy, but ta -- get more people involved, hold more meetings and they would be available to see what was happening in another state, to help -- still a different state, ye- other notions and ideas and try new things out and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Now what would the group have grilled you about, when they met with you over dinner, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was a very friendly discussion between active Democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And of course, they were interested in the fact that I’d been a prosecutor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and that I had edited the official volumes on the later 12 trials, the so-called Green series and I think they were kind of glad to have me come aboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  No, I just wondered what role <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> might have had in -- in that, and you answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  I don’t think it -- I don’t think it had much direct role, it -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> exposures of things that were against democracy and the dictatorship, of course, contributed to democracy and I often mentioned the Fascist dictatorship in my discussions, naturally, because they’d been such a big part of my life, earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Your years as deputy chair, wh-what do you look back on as your accomplishments in that role?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Well, we were asked to come to the Democratic National Convention and to make a presentation to the whole convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So Paul Butler introduced me and I said, fac -- many of you people here, that are active at the state level, know what has been done by the political organization wing of the Democratic National Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Well, I want to just -- just tell you a few things that we have done and will be doing and to ha -- allow you to ask questions, encourage your questions and then I want to have each of the regional representatives talk to you and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So, up here, in a little book that contains the proceedings of the Democratic National Committee convention in 1959, you'll find about 10 pages where we spoke for perhaps altogether, up to nearly an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  What were the most important issues then? </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You were 1n that role from -- Was that 1957 to 1960?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Do you know, I -- I have a hard time now, figuring out what the roles were that we most talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I think they generally involved the idea of more social reform that would benefeet-fit people. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We had a -- a senior citizens group as well and we had an agriculture group, a farmer’s group. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We had a labor group, and they were available to help push democratic ideas through the democratic digest and through special releases and through the many speeches that we helped influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  What about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and your -- your post-<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> sort of sensitivity in the decades after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I’m thinking of major events, the Civil Rights Movement or the McCarthy era or the Feminist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I think you would have been a person with sort of strong views on -- at all these times, a clear sense of what was right and wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Well, yes, but I -- I think it’s rather difficult for me to go into all the ethical and political implications of that time back there, three years before 1960. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We helped elect President Kennedy and we were delighted with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I can still remember when he was leaving the <span class="DLF">platform</span> in -- at the 1960 convention and some poor photographer had gotten off to the side and -- and had missed him, so I flagged him down as he was walking across the <span class="DLF">exit ramp</span> , and he stopped and waved and this fellow took a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Well, little things like that are those that stick out in your mind as you look back. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The fact that you -- we had a big conference in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> and -- and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">head table</span> of about 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The head of the party in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> had the central seat and Kennedy sat next to him, in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I sat in seat 17, on the very end and I said nothing, because I wasn’t called on to say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We’d -- We weren’t -- We didn’t -- The [indecipherable] organization side of the Democratic National Committee encouraged other people to be active and talking and doing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We were not the public relations side of the committee, which created speeches and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  But it would be hugely important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Yes, it -- some people have said that’s -- without our work, that Kennedy wouldn’t have been elected. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Well, I think that’s problematical, but in all events, we were certainly a large contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Did you talk, you know, in these -- a-at these times? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Would your experiences at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had been something that you’d -- would often -- would it often come up in conversation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  You have a chapter in your book on the legacy of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , but I'd wonder if you'd talk about that in general terms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Well, aft -- right after the first trial, the general assembly of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , enacted a declaration on international law and affirming the principles of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I’m not sure that that made a tremendous efe -- had a tremendous effect on the -- large numbers of people, but it did contribute to those who were concerned with international law and with strengthening the United Nations and international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The Nuremberg trial set a precedent for trials held immediately after the first trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> there were 12 other trials, a total of about 190 other people were tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Then there were trials in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British war zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There were trials in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French war zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We didn’t hear about any trials in the <span class="REGION">Soviet zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The Soviet representative at the first Nuremberg trial, left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> the -- just after th-the tribunal made it’s decision in the first trial and they never associated with the later trials, at their election. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">However, they did allow our representatives to carry on investigations in the Soviet zone and they were cooperative in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">About two years later, during the later trials, a press contingent of Soviet journalists, did come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> for one or two days and I recall sitting in with General Taylor as he was asked questions by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And of course, we tried to turn it around and ask them a few questions as to why there were -- had been some trials that we knew about in the eastern zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they were rather embarrassed by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Toward the end of the trials, the Genocide Convention was enacted as a treaty and it is of course, since been ratified by almost all nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">it took the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> quite some time to recognize it, because again some people, raising the banner of sovereignty were worried that the Genocide Convention would give other people the right to look into what was happening in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The declaration of -- of human rights by the General Assembly was [indecipherable] related to the rights we ex -- expounded at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And Eleanor Roosevelt at that time, said, “This is a fine declaration on human rights, but without some legal obligations, will governments be inspired to see that these rights are enforced?” </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And of course, that was a very incisive comment. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The -- As I’ve mentioned, the international law committee of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> did reaffirm the Nuremberg principles and this led -- after we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , this helped lead to a tremendous number of trials of Germans, by the <span class="BUILDING">German courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">This is something most people don’t know anything about. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">There’s a whole book on it by a gentleman by the name of Rukerle, who was -- who was in charge of keeping track of these war crimes trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And there’s been a tremendous number of books published in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which deal with the Nazi regime and an American photographer by the name of Ray Daddario, has cooperated with the German authorities in publishing a number of photographs concerning the Nazi regime and the Nuremberg trial, and these have sold very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> there are at least two striking exhibitions that refer back to the Nazi period. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">One is in the old <span class="BUILDING">Reichstag building</span> , and there they have a photographic exhibit that must be a half block long, where you walk along and you get pictures of the development of the Nazi regime, including it’s horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">A little ways away from that, there is a -- what’s called a Platzenzae memo-memorial. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And that’s a very striking memorial. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It has a -- a <span class="DLF">marble wall</span> which says, in German, “To the victims of Fascism.” </span><span class="sentence" id="285">A little ways away, there’s a circular statue -- there’s a statue with a -- a base which is circular and it has arrows which point in the direction of various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And it’s very striking, you can’t think as you walk by that, without realizing that in each of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , hundreds of thousands and in the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , millions of people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The German Minister of Justice has spoken out about the significance of the Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There’s been a tremendous turnaround in German thinking, partly as a result of the Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Course, one of the striking things about the Vietnam war is that a couple of our officers also went on a binge of killing Vietnamese citizens, the kind of thing that can happen when an ideologically motivated person is not constrained and 1s willing to kill people, certainly outside the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">This led to the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley, C-a-l-l-e-y, a junior officer in the US army. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So this is one case where we’ve applied international law to one of our own officers, which is a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The greatest thing that’s happened by way of specific action, took place under the administration of President George Bush, after Saddam Hussein and forces of <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Kuwait</span> -- End of Tape One, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Yes, in 1990, after Saddam Hussein invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> , George Bush -- President George Bush, after consultation with a number of people that were leaders in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and the Secretary General of NATO, he ordered military forces of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to take measures to push back the for -- forces of Irag. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">This was done in a magnificent fashion, by a -- special troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The trouble is that an agreement was made with Saddam Hussein, which didn’t provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and which didn’t provide for any war crimes trials, and which allowed him, over time, to re-institute a dictatorship of the first water. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Now, that is utterly different than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , where we -- the allies that occupied the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they not only conducted war crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to slowly develop and to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We did not have the wisdom to do that, as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and -- in connection with the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> at the time, which 1s a most regrettable thing, and yet it does deal with the thing that started out very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">An inconclusive truce. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I suppose the next thing would be what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and -- beginning in 1991, when military forces of <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , there were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a Nuremberg trial certainly did help, with respect to the creation of the international criminal tribunal for the former <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The war crimes are being studied on a great -- a greatly improved scale, by a number of <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The -- At American College of Law, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , it’s a part of the American University, a professor by the name of Diane F. Orentlicher, O-r-e-n-t-l-1-c-h-e-r, is the director of the war crimes research office, and she has led a group which has helped investigate the details of what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and passed them on to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> didn’t have an adequate staff to do as good a job as it might. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And that very creditable work has been appreciated by several of the top prosecutors, including Louise Arbour, A-r-b-o-u-r, and a conference was held at the Washington College of Law School -- the Wa-Washington College of Law, and several of these representatives, the very top ones, from the International War Crimes Tribunal in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , came and participated in that trial, which got fairly good publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  And you were involved in that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Yes, in a minor way. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I -- I made one little talk and so forth, but thank goodness she had trained and gotten a lot of people who are presently active. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And so my contribution was very limited, and should have been very limited, because they were all sa -- the top people there were all familiar with what had happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and what I might say would be redundant and not too useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Are we moving quickly enough, do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I mean, we’re -- I’m -- I’m thinking of the year 2000 and really this is a new area of -- of law that’s evolving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  Well, what’s evolving is not so much the law itself, because I think that’s relatively clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It’s acceptance by many of the sovereign nations that’s still not appropriate, number one, and number two, we don’t have an international structure that’s sufficiently powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty earlier this year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , the Rome treaty, is a big step in the right direction, but look what year it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It’s the year 1998 and that’s still -- that treaty still has to be ratified by a number of leading nations, including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So th-the -- these is -- this is a very unpleasant <span class="REGION">area</span> for someone like me, who would like to see that moving much more rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  How do you think we can change, most quickly, mankind’s viewpoint on this? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I mean, you went through a particular experience in your life, but how can that education you had, that sensitivity be spread to more people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Well, it isn’t just a question of spreading sensitivity to more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">If people are poor, if people are struggling to stay alive, they tend to be willing to follow a person who has simple answers and who claims to have an enemy, particularly a neighbor or a group or arace. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he drums up agitation about that and these poor, relatively uneducated people throng to his support. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So the question of war crimes really gets down partly to the world’s ability to feed more people, on the one hand, and to curb population growth on the other, so we don’t have these tremendous cases of people struggling to stay alive, in terms of limited resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And the question of educating people who are struggling and fighting among themselves and having great difficulties, to sit back and think and learn, is certainly a central difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  Do you have great concern over the increasing discrepancy 1 -- within the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , of wealth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Yes, indeed, yes indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">How many people are living just above the standard of living or just below it? </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And here we are, supposedly in a very prosperous ca -- time, and yet there are just tremendous numbers of people who are ill-educated and don’t have the opportunity to forge ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The -- The remaining unequal treatment -- the continuing unequal treatment of women, is certainly a significant area where more people have got to become concerned and to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">What -- I’m -- I -- My main worry 1s -- is <span class="NPIP">places</span> like <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , where you have civil wars on every other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> going on, and undoubtedly war crimes or civilian crimes that are at such a broad rate that they have to be classified as something of -- as violations of international law as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">These things have got to be addressed and more people have got to get to work educating more people, who will do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  When you refer to women, were you thinking of women within the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or really women worldwide in the -- the haves and have-nots of -- you know, the lot of women in the <span class="REGION">developing world</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  Well, I think Marian Wright Edelman, who’s -- heads the Children’s Defense Fund, and Hillary Rodham Clinton and a number of other people are trying to do something to a-advance the treatment and education of children, as well as to involve more women in the economic affairs and the political affairs of this <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And, you know, more power to them, but it’s a long way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So many people are struggling from day to day that they don’t have time to really sit down and think things through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  I wonder if I could ask, I’m -- I’m thinking of today as just one example of a day and with each day’s news, I would suppose that you have an interesting viewpoint on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And a -- I was thinking today of the election of a new political leader in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and w-within the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I’m -- I’m thinking of the Lewinsky case. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">There may be other things you want to comment on, but a -- I just think that your own life experiences give you sort of informed views on things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  No, I don’t care to become a great commentator at the age of 85 years, concerning all kinds of domestic affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I think o-others can do a lot better job of that than I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I think that the election in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of the new Prime Minister is a -- an indication that there is still more attention being paid in Europe to international affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">His election I think, like the election of Tony Blair in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , is la -- is more encouraging, because I think it will strengthen NATO and strengthen adherence to international law and treaties. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I think it will lead to more crossing the <span class="DLF">boundaries</span> with respect to reaching people who violate international law and commit atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">As I think I pointed out before, the -- under Cole, as -- as well as I think under the new Premier, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will not be in the background, with respect to taking the lead on strengthening international law and NATO.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  How do you think your own views have changed with time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was an extension in international affairs of some of the ethical principles that had been ground into me for many years before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So I didn’t feel I was moving into new <span class="REGION">territory</span> with respect to decency and ethics, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I knew I was moving in -- into new <span class="REGION">territory</span> with respect to getting international structures made, which could begin to deal with some of the things which were -- which need to be handled on an international basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  What are you proudest of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Well, I’m of course proudest of having served in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> for four years, and for having been editor in chief of the 15 Green volumes, called, “Trials of War Criminals,” before the Nuremberg military tribunals. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I suppose that’s what I’m most proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I hope Pll similarly be proud of this book, but we have to see about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  Well, that’s part -- that’s in a sense a natural progression. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But did you have a sense that -- that your parents were immensely proud of you and what you’d accomplished? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Did they understand the -- the significance, do you feel, at the time of their deaths?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  I think my parents were very proud of the fact that I recetved some recognition for my work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , and that I had become a supergrade and a Deputy Chief Council, but we didn’t talk too much about those kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We talked about m- many more local things that were of importance in <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> and my father and I took fishing trips in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and we played golf together and enjoyed each other, but we didn’t engage in a tremendous na -- amount of discussion about my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They obviously were proud of some of the things I’d done, but we didn’t talk much about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Drexel Sprecher. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">End of Tape Two, Side A Conclusion of Interview </span>
