<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Where's that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or I would call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">A small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...uh...west, [in the] south of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh...very close to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Uh...Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood, your family when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  I am...I was the oldest of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh...I had two sisters, and a little brother who was born in 1933, so he was 6 years old when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My...We lived on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warszawska</span> ...<span class="DLF">Warsaw Street</span> , No. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">10, lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Most people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in...lived in <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> if they lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh...We didn't have private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Mostly, they were <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We had a...uh... nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My father owned a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...uh... where he would...it was a..uh...<span class="BUILDING">knitting factory</span> , but only children's wear, infantâ€™ wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I remember...I remember loving to go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> because it was always white, pink and blue, and light yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Pretty pastels. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Uh...We were not rich, but we were quite comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Most of the time, we had a maid and a cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">When times were really rougher in the business apparently we would only have a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Uh...Then my mother had to do the cooking, and...uh... she didn't like to do that so...uh...as soon as she could, she would get herself a cook again. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh...My mother...that's not fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It's not that my mother didn't like to do it, she had what she called some asthma. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And she maintained that the asthma was...that she wasn't well when she was near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , that 1t made her cough and just not be comfort...not feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think now, in retrospect, that my mother was highly allergic to certain fabrics...uh... wool. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I think the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bad for her, and she used to go and, you know, kind of help my father a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But even if she...and we had rugs at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We had Persian rugs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and she had a Persian runner in her <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">She slept on feather pillows, and I think she had allergies to all of this because during the war when all of that disappeared my mother was much healthier. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So...
QUESTION:  Were you...uh...was your family very involved in the Jewish community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Uh...I...1t's hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My father was a very traditional Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> , but not...not hasidic, not...not ultra-religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I think this was my mother's influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">My father...uh...my father was always much more religious, much more of a believing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My mother was more...uh...the word in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> would have been used modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She...she was...uh...she was more maybe of a skeptic too. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">She kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> for my father and I, and she was observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I... am sure she didn't ride on Sabbath, but she didn't...but I would catch her fixing her stocking, you know, my father didn't...wasn't around looking or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In other words she was...she was much...uh.... So in that sense...uh...was my father involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I suppose so. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was 13 when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I know he used to belong to a...to a little <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I know he used to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I am calling it a <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> because it was not a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It was a little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My mother only went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> during high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But my father used to go every Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">This is what I...I..., I loved my father very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I...I know he was a very good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I remember that even though he was an observant Jew, he used to take money with him on Friday evening and put it.... Somebody told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I didn't...maybe my mom, later on.... He used to look at the hangers, at the coats hanging; and if he found a coat that looked very ragged, somebody passing through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , somebody poor, he used to put the money into this pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">This was giving in secret, kind of. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My father didn't know who he gave it to, and the man didn't know who he got it from. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And my father also used to bring often what you call an ["oreach" (ph)], a guest for Friday evening, to dinner, somebody poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh...That's the extent that I know that my father was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">How he was...whether he was involved in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> or I don't really know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Could you tell me a little bit about your daily life with your, as a child, with your siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Well, I was...uh...as I say, I was 13 when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The last year of my life I went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which 1s a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , name for a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I had finished six grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> until I was 12, and that last year I commuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B_dzin</span> which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> next to ours to a...a...<span class="BUILDING">Jewish Polish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I say Jewish because... uh ...the curriculum in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was dictated by the Department of Education in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I am sure was a accredited, very fine <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh...But the student population was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Not all the teachers were Jewish, not all the professors as we called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And, of course, the important thing is that one of the languages taught in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was Hebrew as a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And then history, Jewish history, and bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Uh... This was my first exposure to Hebrew, as a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I had one year of Hebrew before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The reason I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B_ dzin</span> 1s because...we had a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> , the same type of a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> ; but my father came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B_dzin</span> and my father thought that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B_dzin</span> was better. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I think he was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was a...a better <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and he wanted me to go to a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was not happy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Many of my friends were going to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and I didn't like going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I used to get up in the morning and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> was very near my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because we lived one block away from the <span class="DLF">street</span> on which there was a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I used to run for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> usually after 2:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We had dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I usually...1 remember that dinner was about 2:30 and this is one thing I had to be very prompt for. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My father didn't... didn't like anybody being late for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This was for our meal that we spent together as a family everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">After dinner, my father used to go back to his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Uh...I usually did my homework, played with some friends, fought with my siblings. (</span><span class="sentence" id="95">Laughter) It was a very normal, usual childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I had a very happy <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I came from a very...I was...] was a very happy child...uh...until the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  You'll have to move your hand over between the mike. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Uh...Can you tell me...uh...what recollections you have of the beginning of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Oh, I have very clear recollections because...uh...the war broke out on September Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="102"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> was supposed to start on September Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I was supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Remember I told you I didn't like this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I was very glad that the war broke out because I didn't have to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">This is how stupid I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I was just...1t's amazing when I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">At 13, I think I should have been a little more...understanding, but I...I suppose I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It's not fair to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But there was also that feeling of relief that I don't have to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And there was also a kind of change in our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">For instance, we had come back from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We used to go...every summer we used to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we came back around August 25th, which is very late. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">War was in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I mean we...we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so we didn't hear that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> things were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">People were being drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Things were really going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I know when we came back, my mom was trying to buy some food, just make sure that there's some food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because she had survived the first World War and she knew that times are going to be rough in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And she couldn't get any...any...any food that really was...any staple food. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She couldn't get flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She couldn't get potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">She couldn't get the kind of things that you need, starch, you know, to... and we were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so there was no...there was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But what she was able to...to get were all kinds of delicacies, because these were still available. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So there were all kinds of canned foods and lots of chocolates and halva and...and all kinds of fancy cookies...uh...uh...dried fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She bought what she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Well that was..., you know, for a kid that was also a little exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Uh... What was really strange is, 1t didn't take long for us to really get hungry for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">That was really something. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was... there was no bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There was no...there was no meat... no...uh...there was no food, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">There was fun food, but you, you know, and, of course, my mom wasn't that...you know, she was holding on to it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I remember my brother being very...very unhappy when we finally were able to get some bread when the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , when we stood 1n <span class="DLF">lines</span> to get the bread after the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">How my brother was asking my mother for another slice of bread and my mom said, "No, just one slice of...slice of bread." </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was...I remember it was so...it wasn't hunger yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We weren't hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was just the idea that things were missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I do remember that the Germans walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , on September 3rd, because you see we were so close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I remember (cough) that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Everybody was...nobody was going out onto the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">People were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> rolling into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There was tremendous noise, shouting. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There were some shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">People may have been caught in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I didn't see any of it, but I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I was afraid to go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> even though some of our <span class="DLF">windows</span> were going out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And...uh...(Coughing) (drinking water) and I, as I said, I...I just remember that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the beginning because apparently it was either we were not allowed to go into the <span class="DLF">street</span> or we were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And then I suppose we started going out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I do remember two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I remember apparently being told by my parents to go out early in the morning and try to get some bread in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I don't know...I don't remember whether I went with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I think I may have gone with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I know my mother didn't want my father out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we went and I remember we stood tn <span class="DLF">line</span> for a long time, and we did get a bread and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">That was the first memory of...of something that was scary because it was dark <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and the <span class="DLF">lines</span> were long and the Germans were standing 1n a kind of making sure that nobody was getting into the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And...uh...everybody was allowed to buy one bread. (</span><span class="sentence" id="159">Cough) About 10 days or 2 weeks after we were...after the Germans came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...uh...they came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...into our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">By the way, in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> ...uh...I don't know how many tenants lived there, but not all of them were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They came into the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and they started to shout, "Alle Juden, Raus!", </span><span class="sentence" id="162">which means "All Jews Out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They were telling us to come down to the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I remember my father and my mother, the four of us went down <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I think our cook was still with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She may have come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">She left shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">She went back to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And they took my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They took all the men, and we went back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I don't...I don't remember how long my father was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I am sure it wasn't very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Maybe a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">What I do remember is that my father had auburn hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">You have auburn hair, don't you? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My father had auburn hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">When he came back, he was practically grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I...[ do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He was born in 1900, so he was 39 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">He was grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And...uh...I also remember that not all men came back, because we heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Apparently, they...they killed some, just at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But it was also at that time that they chose, that they asked the people who...who was a member of a committee of the Jewish...uh... Jewish Community. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">If...1f...every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had a Rabbi, had a Jewish Community. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I do remember that...uh...no, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I...I was told that the man who was chosen to be the head of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was a man by the name of [Moinyek Meren (ph)]. [</span><span class="sentence" id="188">Moinyek (ph)] is a probably somewhat Polish name for Moshe. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">His name was Meren. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He was a...he was probably also in his late 30s, maybe my father's age, and he had...he had worked for us at one time before the war as a...uh...I don't want to call it traveling salesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He was a salesman, and he was...he had a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> where he would...uh...go0 in and had customers he sold, you know, the products of my father's. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You know, my father produced that was, you know, made in our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And he became the head of the committee of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> , and probably other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Uh...My father, as I said, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and shortly after that something else happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Two things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">First our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was taken over by what the Germans called a "Treuhandler." '"</span><span class="sentence" id="197">Treuhandler" means somebody that the Germans could trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was a German who took over the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but my father was working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">He was in effect probably teaching the Treuhandler and, you know, how to run the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="200">NB: German "Treuhandler" = trustee or custodian| And he...uh....because of that, he was allowed some...he was probably getting some money for his work, and he was given ration cards, and so was his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Everybody had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The fact that my father worked was very important because then we were allowed to get...uh...cards so that we could...we were able to buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was all rationed, but we had the coupons to buy whatever was allowed for us to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now let me tell you a little bit about our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because it was a little different then for instance, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Until the end of 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> was what you called an open ghetto, which means that we were not...we were not walled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And many of us stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">For instance, we stayed 1n our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in 1940...at the end of 1942, except that they had...we didn't have the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> all to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We had to share it with other refugees, with other Jews who were.... We've had for instance a family living with us that came in from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They were German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Uh...Some Jews had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It depended on...some <span class="DLF">streets</span> became what you called "Judenrein," "Free of Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Those... uh ...the people who lived on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that became Judenrein, that the Jews were not allowed, they had to be moved into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where the Jews were allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">My <span class="DLF">street</span> was still one of the streets that was part of the open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And we lived in that <span class="DLF">street</span> , on that <span class="DLF">street</span> , as I say, until the end of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And interestingly enough in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , there were still the Polish tenants were still living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So while we were not allowed into some <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and some of...and the Poles were allowed into some <span class="DLF">streets</span> , the Poles could come into the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Because of that and, as I said, because it was that kind of an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was a possibility for some barter, for some dealings with the Poles; and maybe even with some Germans, although I don't know, or "Volksdeutsch," half-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And because of that situation in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in terms of hunger, until about 42 was not that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">It was...it depended...I shouldn't say that...1t depended really on what your situation was because the rationing...uh...the food that you were allowed, legally, was really not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But if you had some other means, you could if you had some hidden jewelry, you could get something on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So you could supplement your rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And in that sense some people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> fared better than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">People who were poor to start with, did worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">People who had something, did better. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Now that doesn't mean that people were able to keep everything they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">This brings me to the other story....uh...because also shortly, that was all in the fall of 1939, there was a knock on our <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And there was a German woman and two SS men were with her and she...they came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and she walked through the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she turned to the SS men and she said, "Ich habe gernes. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Alles." -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="229">T like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">All of it." </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And they send in some people a day later...uh...probably they brought in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they unloaded, they took everything out of...out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I'm talking about our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">All our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , rugs, whatever...whatever she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She was a nice...nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She sent us an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , some old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Uh...wardrobe, probably what she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">She must not have been a very well-to-do woman, but you see she became rich because she was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> left then and, of course, the German I am sure you know that...that there were from the beginning, they were collecting everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">First you had to give...give away all your gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Then they came in and they took all your silver (cough) so that there were a lot of things that my parents, I am sure, had to give away, but I am also sure that my mom, or my parents may have hidden some things, because I know that in the beginning of the war we were able to get some extra food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Uh...Then it got much worse, and about a year...1939...19...in 1940, things were semi-normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I shouldn't call it normal, but life just went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">My father was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Then my mother had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But I and my sister and even my younger sister were privately tutored. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">That was not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="247"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> , of course, were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">There wasn't....there were no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But my parents...my parents, you see, were hoping that the war is going to end. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They didn't...they didn't envisage anything like that, and they felt that we needed to continue with our education so...uh...as little as they had, they paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We had...there were some teachers, professors who used to teach in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and...uh...when I say I was privately tutored, I don't mean that I was tutored on a one-to-one basis, but what we had is we would go to our...to a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's home</span> during the day and there were, let's say, 12 of us, and we would learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We would study Polish literature, history, geography...uh...some sciences, but that was difficult because we had no <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I remember working very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">This was, see, now I was very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">This was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I...I...I think I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> til the beginning...(sigh) 'til the beginning of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">When I say in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was...I was getting...taking lessons, even though somewhere around '41, I think in the summer of 1941, I started working somewhere in a...in one of those ghetto resorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">In other words, <span class="BUILDING">ghetto factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But probably not full-time because I still had some time for lessons, and then I no longer could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I had to work full-time and I had to give up, but I know that I studied a lot, and I even took some...a lot of Hebrew during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Because it was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I also tutored my younger, my kid brother who was only six when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I taught him how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I taught him a lot of mathematics, and he was a whiz anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He was very good in mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So I...uh...so in that sense there were some, there was a certain amount of normalcy in our life because my parents, as I say, believed in the beginning that things are going to be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And...uh...I don't think they realized what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">In the beginning, my father, I remember, used to listen to a BBC radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">One of the neighbors had a hidden radio, and he would come back and tell us that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell; and then I think that it was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Of course, we also had a curfew and we were not allowed into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I think after 7 o'clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And that, by the way, was good in one way for me as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I read constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There were still <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> that you can borrow books from. </span><span class="sentence" id="275"><span class="BUILDING">Private libraries</span> , and I used to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I think that I...I got a...1 got my really basic education during this because I was reading constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I... suppose my parents encouraged it, but I really was always a bit of a bookworm and I... So this was, as I said, things started and...and nobody...nobody realized what...what was going to happen because, again, I am painting a...I am giving you a kind of picture of...now, of course, with it...uh... things started to happen in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">People started to disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Mostly, at that point, young people were taken to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and...uh... and people would just disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They would be walking in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they would be taken to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">People were also taken constantly to work in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I remember coming back from somewhere and being...I was still young, so it didn't happen to me often, but it happened to my father a lot that they would take people who had to shovel show, clear the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They were always looking for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">You know, in addition to the fact that people had to work, they were always catching people, if you will, for some additional work, but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as I say there was a militia and we were again, ...how shall I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The governing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was done by the....by the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Now when my.... Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">In 1942...Let me...I can't...I...you don't want to take that long so...
QUESTION:  Take your time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">In...two things happened in 19...things started... things started to turn towards the end of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The winter of 1941 was really a hard winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The winter before was hard, too; but this winter started it was a very cold winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was difficult to get heating. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Food was getting scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Things were getting rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">By...by the end of 1941, many people had been taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but again if they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Most of them were young men and women taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And in 1942, sometimes around March, they came and took some...the militia people, not even Germans, came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and, with a list, and I was on that list, and they took me...uh...out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to take me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Now in order to get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> uh...they didn't...we were not taken directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We were taken to what was once a...the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> , which now served as a "Durchgangslager." "</span><span class="sentence" id="300">Durchgangslager" means a transition [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit] camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We were put in there until, I suppose, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owners or people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would come and select people for different ... uh ... activities or different work. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And there was a camp for women, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> for women, and for men, and that night they must have taken a lot of men and a lot of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And...young, young.... I was not quite sixteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I was..., this was the beginning of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was born in 1926, so I was 15 and a half, and my...uh...my parents were apparently devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They shouldn't have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">If they had known about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they should have been glad that I'm not being...that I'm going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to work, but they didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they wanted to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I was my father's favorite daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I don't think people should have favorites, but I think my...I was my...I was a favorite of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And he was...he was heartbroken. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And he wanted to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And at that time, there were still people who were able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now the way you did it is you paid money to a family that was poorer than you were, if you could afford it; and somebody--but this was a voluntary arrangement--and that somebody would go for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And my father apparently found a family where they were terribly poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">There was...in other words, 1f we were hungry, they were hungrier, and my father apparently gave them whatever, promised to give them whatever he...I don't know, maybe he had a ring left... whatever he had...and their daughter...and I think my father.... That was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Their daughter was about 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">She was a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I think what bothered my father..., I think he was very troubled, was that I was really basically still a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I was only 15 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Now I wasn't the only one at 15 and a half taken; but for my father, this was...so they made arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And she was supposed to come in in the morning to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> , and say that she 1s my substitute, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Now I didn't know anything about it except, because we were...there were...nobody was allowed to come and see us, except that I would come to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and my father would pass by and he kind of motioned to me that...that they're trying to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And that morning my name was called, and I...and I was told to take my...whatever stuff I had because when they took me to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> , they permitted my parents to bring some clothing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So I had some clothing with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I took my bundle, whatever I had and I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I was walking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And as I was walking out, I noticed that my sister--who was born 2 and 1/2 ...who was 13--was walking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I...I was...I was... was...first of all, I had been in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> for...for a good week. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I was tired and hungry and dirty and sleepy and...because it was not a very pleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So I was very...I was...I was not quite there; but I did see my sister, and when I ran out and I...my father wasn't...people ...people are not allowed near, but when I crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I saw my father and my mother, I started to cry and I said, "What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Why is Pnina...why is my sister...why did she go in there? </span><span class="sentence" id="332">What happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And they started to cry, and they told me that that morning when this woman who is supposed to go for me was supposed to come in and they were supposed to take her, she had changed her mind and they were desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They...they had made all the arrangements, but they didn't have the substitute; whereupon my younger sister, who was a real tomboy, always was, said, "I am going to go for Bella." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And my father...my parents thought she's crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">First, of all what kind of an exchange was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I mean...and she said, "Don't you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I am 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They are not going to keep me. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They are going to send me right back." </span><span class="sentence" id="341">She was going to fool them. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don't know how my parents could ... I think that they were...I don't think that...I don't think that they were thinking clearly because it was...1t was a crazy plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But they allowed her to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And she was also very, my sister's a very strong person. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">She must have been very persuasive, and my parents were very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They must have been in a very bad state, and she was very upbeat about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I suppose, I... wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But I know that my sister went in there, and my parents expected her to be sent out a day later and she was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> , which is in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And...uh... I don't have to tell you how we all felt, ...how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She went for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And...uh...at that time, she was allowed to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Once a month we would get a postcard from her, and she wrote cheerful notes; that she's okay, that she's the youngest in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> everybody's taking care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And lo and behold, three months after she was taken to this <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> we got...we received a letter from the Jewish Community that she is coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and two days later...really three months after she had left...she went...she left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she came in from German ... from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with her belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">One of those unusual things, but this is very German. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Apparently...now then she told us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">When she got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> she told the Commandofihrer, the Lager...the German, that she was taken by mistake, that she's 13 years old, that she's a child, that she's not...and she wants to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And...uh...1t took three months, but they arranged to send her back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Now one of the...as I say, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was operating. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They could have very...they could have sent her...they should have sent her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Anybody getting sick in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , anybody claiming not being able to work was always sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I don't know why they didn't send her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I think it's...1t was this German bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Once she convinced the Commandofihrer there that she didn't belong here and that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and her parents were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , she was sent back to her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And...uh...she became somewhat of a celebrity, I think, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because first of all, the fact that she managed...first of all that she went for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Secondly, that she managed to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Very few people... no, I don't remember anybody coming back from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Maybe there was some case, but she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And...uh...she was such a celebrity that...(sigh)... celebrity...that in this same year--1942, August, a very memorable time for...for me, for us--we were...orders were posted all...all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that all the Jewish inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> have to come to the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We had a <span class="BUILDING">sports stadium</span> on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .

We were taken into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , and I started working in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">flax factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We had two shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We worked 12 hours in the day time and then the following week 12 hours at night; without a break, so that one day every two weeks was really hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Because you would come in from a night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">In the morning...I'm trying to remember how it was...or was there a break? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We used to come in....I know that there was one day where we would come in at night (pause) and sleep through. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Yah, we would sleep through, so they would give us a break and then we'd go on a night...on the day shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And...uh...the work was hard because we took the job of actually the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was manned, was wom...the people who worked there before were men, who were sent to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So we were supposed to do work that was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And we were, of course, not getting much food. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But I know, again, that 1t was not terrible, because we did get a pound of bread a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We received one soup a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Now the soups in the beginning were not too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There was some...uh...Kohlrabi...or some other things in it...spinach. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Later on, they got more and more watery. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But we did get a soup a day and a pound of bread a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Some black ersatz coffee once a day and once a week we would get a small, probably a teaspoon, of margarine, a teaspoon of some jam, and I think that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But this was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We were able to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And...uh...uh...I worked in the what you call [Riefenlager (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It was the first...1t was the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> ...uh...it was like...it looked like an open <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">There were no <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Or there were <span class="DLF">doors</span> that you could open because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were coming in right near that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and we had to unload the big bundles of flax from...from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> into that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ; and then inside that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , there were big machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They....they looked...they had...they looked like a machine with a big comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">You had to put that bundle of flax. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I did all of this, depending on what was my...my day. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Sometimes I would unload the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Sometimes I would stand near the machine, open up that big bundle of flax, put it underneath, because flax has little round...uh...uh.... seed and inside...actually a round little ball, and inside the ball there is a seed and it was out of that seed that they were making oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So you had to comb this through that machine and that...that would go down where they were collecting these...the seed. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And then we were supposed to send that through a battery tube...that went to a next department. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">This was a...this was a fully automated ... automated <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> so... The reason that I am telling you that is that all the Germans had to do, all the...we had SS men that walked us from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">All they had to do is stand over our heads because the quicker, the faster we worked that's how quickly the whole <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And that was very very important because..., and so we were usually given the roughest time because they were...they were always shouting, screaming at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">That doesn't mean that the rest of the women that were working the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> didn't have a rough time because they had to work as fast as we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And it wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">In...let me tell you two things that I remember that were kind of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">One is a very unusual story. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Our...our Kapo, if you will, was a lovely woman from our...from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who was a little older. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">She was about 23. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">She was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Her name was [Salka Abramezik (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">She's alive, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I saw her a couple of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">She had studied voice before the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , I think; in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">She had a beautiful soprano. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And...uh...she would...when we worked...and she was not a real Kapo of the kind...I mean she was...she used to come around and help us and she was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">She...she was not screaming at us or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And when night fell, when we were working on the night shift, we usually would get a break, a half an hour break when they would bring the soup from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because on night shift, we used to eat at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We would get our soup 1n the...at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So we would huddle around kind of sitting together because it was cold and she would usually dish out the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We all...always carried with us our bowls for soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And we would sit around, eat our soup and sometimes we would talk and sometimes we would be quiet and sometimes...sometimes when it moved her, [Salka (ph)| would sing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And that particular night 1t was very cold, and we were kinda of sitting very close to her and she started to sing Schubert's Serenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And she had a very, really beautiful voice, and she was really... even with a kerchief and...and...and most of her hair gone, she really was a very pretty, very beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And she was singing and it was so sweet, ...1t was a...just a lovely thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I remember that for those few minutes I forgot where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">It felt so warm and beautiful, to listen to her sing; and...uh...suddenly I...I...1 probably wasn't the only one, I noticed that we were not alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Somebody's watching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I turned my head very kind of slightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I was afraid to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I noticed that one of the SS men was standing near us, and he was looking at her singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">She was singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">She didn't notice him. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And he was really looking at her with rapt...what you call you rapture or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He really was enchanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It was obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I remember I was very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And suddenly she must have noticed that he was looking at her, and she stopped singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And he walked towards her and kinda of pushed us to the aside and he...she was sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">He pulled her up and he started to beat on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He hit on her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Right, left. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">He was beating on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And he was screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">He was screaming so loudly. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">He probably was maybe her age, maybe a couple of years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And he was screaming, "You have no right to sing to like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">You have no right to look like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">You filthy Jew." (</span><span class="sentence" id="634">long pause) I remember something else that happened in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And that was...1 don't know how much time I have and I...I want to tell you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> because I think it's important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  Take all the time you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Uh...One night it was also on the night shift, we heard that one of the girls working 1n the...in the last of the departments there. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I don't...I don't really know what do you call it, the department in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but it was a <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">It was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">It was the place where they already making the thread putting it on spools; so they had big combines, big machines with big...uh...uh...I don't know what you call them...like a big tape running made out of rubber, and the women that were operating that machine...they were usually very close to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Apparently one of those big combine machines...the rubber on it snapped and hit one of the girls in the eye, and apparently she lost her eye immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">She...it...1t swam out or..something...1n other words, she lost her eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And...uh...immediately...uh...somebody took her back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We had what you call a Krankenstube [NB: a <span class="INT_SPACE">sickroom</span> ], a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">There was a nurse, an inmate, one of the inmates who really wasn't a nurse but she knew, I suppose, how to give a...a....a...how to put a bandage...we didn't have much equipment, but if anybody was sick that's where...that's where.... And she...uh...she was taken to this Stube, to this...to this <span class="INT_SPACE">sick room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Uh...We heard about it because I suppose there were some older women in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that had some sense of...of...of getting organized, because I know they came down to us and they said...uh...that when we come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we usually had to be counted...it was on "Appell." </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We had to come in into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and we were counted and then we were permitted to go to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> --that we are not to go back to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but demand that she...this girl whose name was Rose...be taken to a doctor because there was no help. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">She couldn't get any help there and we knew she was going to die or send...send out. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And say it was foolish, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We all decided we're going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">It's one of those unrecorded things or maybe it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Other people who survived my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We came back from that...from that...uh...night shift, and when we were counted and our Commandofuhrer--fihrerin, the woman--started to shout that we can go back to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we didn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And she...she was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And she said, "What's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">You are to go to your <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And we didn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And then a few stepped out and said that there was an accident 1n the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> at night, and we are asking that this girl be taken to a doctor because there's no doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And she...she thought 1t was crazy so she started beating on us, particularly in the people on the first row. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And this was going on...she was beating us. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I do remember that I was one of the first ones... wasn't maybe in the first row, but I was in the second row. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I remember being beaten up pretty badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I don't even want to tell you how beat...badly, so I don't remember what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But I do remember one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">That when I came to, I was told that what happened is that the people--the owners of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the Germans who are still the foremen--when they heard that we are standing and not going back to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they became concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Concerned possibly that we won't be able to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">We'll be so exhausted or maybe there was again this kind of a sense of...of fairness that sometimes...but they insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They came and there apparently was a lot of talking between the SS men and lo and behold, this 1s a true story. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">That girl, Rose, was taken out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with...with that nurse and with an SS man and taken to a local doctor who--apparently she had had an infection--took care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">She went...I know she went about a half a dozen of times to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to the doctor, and they put in a glass eye in 1943 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graben</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">A German doctor put in a glass eye, and the girl survived and I know because I heard she's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I never saw her after the war, but I know she survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And that was something that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Now, of course, we could have all been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I don't think we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">This is...this leads me to the next story. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I still didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I was getting cards from my parents once a month, and then mail stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I knew something was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I knew on Yom Kippur in 1943, a transport came to our camp from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graben</span> ...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and among the women that came were women from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They had gone through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I remember seeing somebody who I...who may have been a neighbor, or maybe lived on the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I asked, "Do you know what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Where are my parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Do you know what's going on?" </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And I remember that she was so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">She didn't even go into any...she just said, "You mean, you don't know? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">They're killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They're dead." (</span><span class="sentence" id="689">long, long pause) I...I...I remember that I...I remember two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I remember the realization when she said to me...she told me they're... she... remember she used the word...she said, "They were ...they were sent to a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They were cremated." </span><span class="sentence" id="692">She was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , and by the time she made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graben</span> , she was at least for that time a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Frieda was my camp sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">She was Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">She and I shared everything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We were like sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">If, occasionally, she got an extra soup, she would save me a half of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">If I got anything extra, bowl of soup or something, I did some extra work or something, I saved it for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I want you to know that I...when I would take that bowl of soup...this I, this honest, I would take that spoon and I would go around that...I would mark it off to make sure that I know which half is hers and I would come as close as it is humanly possible to her, to the part of...to that marker because I don't think...and I never...I never gave her an extra spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But I never took an extra spoon from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I don't know where I took that strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">There were times when I didn't have that strength and I would like to tell you about it, but this time...but when it came to Frieda, I never cheated on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't think she ever cheated on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">In 1944, in the fall of 1944, we were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graben</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We heard rumors that the Russians are moving in, that they have occupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But these were rumors and we were sent on what you call the famous "Death March." </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It was November I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was cold, and we were marched for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I don't remember how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Then we were put into <span

was Frieda's older sister, and she was looking for Tila. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And when Frieda heard her name, she stepped out and she said, "I am not Tila," but I am her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">What do you know about Tila?" </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Because Tila was her oldest sister and she was taken out of their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> early in the war cause she volunteered...she was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they thought, to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and she was one of the very early inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">This is what Frieda found out from this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And this Tila was apparently one of those unusual women that whenever she could save somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> she did, and she saved this girl's life. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">She literally pulled her out...out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And this woman was looking for Tila because she wanted to repay a debt. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She wanted to...to find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">When she saw Frieda, she said ...1mmediately, she believed her because apparently... I...[ know, I met Tila after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They looked exactly the same except that Tila was dark haired and the other one was blond, but Tila had the same eyes, the same face; and she said, "Yah, I believe you that you are her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">You look like her. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And I am going to take you out of her because you will die here." </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And Frieda said, "Then you have to take Bella." </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And this woman looked at me and at Frieda and she said, "I'm not taking Bella. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I'm taking you. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I don't owe anything to Bella. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">If you want to come with me, you come right now." </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And Frieda was hesitating cause she wasn't going to go without me, and I said to Frieda, "Frieda, for God's sake, go. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">First of all if you can save yourself, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And secondly, maybe you can help me if you get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">You certainly won't be able to help me if you're here." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So she got out and she became a...a runner for a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Uh...And I think that because of it, she had a little easier time of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">She had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">She wasn't in this horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> and she had a little more food, because food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was given very sporadically. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">You never knew when you were going to get a piece of bread or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And again when she could, she would come in and bring me a potato or whatever she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I would get up every morning, I was covered with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I wore one of those...uh...concentration camp uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">You know, they were grey and blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Well, in the morning you couldn't see the blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">It was all grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I was totally covered with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">As long as I could I used to shake. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I used to take this thing off and I used to shake it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">If I could get some cold water, I would wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Later on, I am sure I didn't wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I would shake out all the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I would put that thing on, and half an hour later, I was covered with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I had typhus; then I had typhoid, which is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Typhus 1s a stomach illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Typhoid is a fever, headaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I don't know how I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And at the end of the war, I had paratyphoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But before that...before I had this paratyphoid, after I pulled through this both typhus and typhoid, ...uh...Frieda managed to find, for me, a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And she got me out of that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , which was the worse, into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where I could have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> which I shared with another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So this was not great luxury, but it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and I was permitted to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">What was my work consisting of? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It was working doing inventory, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We would go in the morning to a big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , where they had a lot of clothing, and we had to separate slips from panties, blouses from..., things that the Germans took from...they must have shipped it from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They were still...this was already...we...we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> at...in December of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It was a long time to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> and survive it, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to...that you could last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And this probably already March, end of... because I was liberated in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">This was somewhere in March, that I was working in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and the Germans were still doing inventory on clothing that they had...that they robbed, that they took from...from Jewish victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And...uh...what was the big thing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And that was how...how could I help myself by working? </span><span class="sentence" id="799">First of all, because I was working again, I was given a soup; but I could also steal something. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I could put on a pair of panties. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I could go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I was allowed...under my uniform, I was allowed a pair of panties, a...a skirt and a blouse maybe, and a sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Okayâ€™?

I was...I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I was bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">If he had given me just an opportunity to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn how to type or to become a bookkeeper, I would have, you know, been able to do something better than work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in a wrapping department wrapping things. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">But I think my uncle didn't... didn't think this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">He didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Uh...He capped my teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I had had some teeth knocked out during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So he capped my... you know, he took me to a very fine dentist on <span class="DLF">Sth Avenue</span> , and they did a beautiful job putting caps on my teeth, probably as beautiful as some of the Hollywood... Hollywood. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I had very, you know, I..he did a very nice job. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I had had some front teeth broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Uh...But he did not...he did not...uh...help me out any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">He...uh...Henry and I started going out about, just shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Henry then went..., uh...he worked for awhile in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> too, then he started working. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">He had a year of <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so he started working in [Mt.] Sinai Hospital. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And... uh...then he passed the New York Boards, whatever they call them, and he was accepted in <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> and we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">He went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I supported him. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I started taking courses in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , then I went to visit my sister in 1959 and I became a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">By the way, until 1959, I had a bit of a detour with my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I didn't...1 was Jewish, but I wasn't particularly traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I think Henry didn't go to work on Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">That was the extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">But when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1959 and I walked through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , I became a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I... came back and I decided instead of becoming an accountant, which I was considering because I was good with numbers, to learn Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I had remembered some, but not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I went...I started studying at <span class="BUILDING">Baltimore Hebrew College</span> , and I got my Bachelors of Hebrew Letters, and my license and in between while I was doing this, I was already teaching Hebrew and... Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">ANSWER:  Just maybe one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">As I started to tell you that I had a detour with God, and I did settle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I don't know whether Henry...I don't think Henry is a believing Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I think he's an agnostic, but I do believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And I believe...I do want to say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I believe that God is not responsible for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I think people are. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I think that people were given a choice, always, and taught what is right and what is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And the Germans are the ones who were responsible for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">They built <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I don't think God was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And that's how I can live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Otherwise, I would have a problem.</span></p>
