<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Which is where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Which is part of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Could you tell me something about your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Well, my parents — of course, to me they were the best parents in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father made a living for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And we were a happy family with two other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">There was three of us, a brother, we were two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And we had a beautiful family. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We had a large family, uncles and aunts, grandparents, niece and nephews, nieces, cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Unfortunately, all of them were killed by the Germans, by the Nazis actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And there's very little, very few of us left at the present time. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And what is there to talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We had a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We had a beautiful life until World War II came around and this is when our problems started and our life was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But we survived, minus my father, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It's just the four of us who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And where do we start talking about our lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Tell me what happened when the Nazis came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  When they came in we tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We thought perhaps we would go to <span class="REGION">White Russia</span> which supposedly, you could be safe there, but it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">After two days of traveling, we had to turn back and we came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">At that time the Nazis had already fencing in about 20 blocks or so — and all the Jewish people had to move out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and go to live in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And had some distant cousins living there, so we moved in with them and we lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father since he spoke many languages, he was taken by the Nazis as an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And so he would work during the day and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The rest of us — I would — I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My mother and my sister were taken to work to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> every day and brought back in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">While living there, of course, life was very harsh, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We could not go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You were supposed to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The minute we moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we had — they put up the yellow stars on each one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We always had to walk around in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with a yellow star, one in the back and one up front. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Frightening it was, but that was part of our lives and we existed like this for a few months until one morning very early we heard knocking on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and yelling, you know, “Get out! </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Get out! </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Get out!” </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So quickly we got dressed and we walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we were staying in. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The Gestapo was there and they told us all to go in a certain direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My mother put on me my beautiful rabbit coat that I had, a rabbit coat and a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And we started following the other people, and they took us to a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It must have been a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and they told us to get undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And they would make you take off the jewelry and everything, any valuables that you had on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They undressed — they told us to get undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We all did. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The women remained with the underwear only, and the men in their shorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my mother wasn't fast enough to take off her gold earrings, so she was hit by a Gestapo with the handle of a rifle and she fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We picked her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And all of us — there were a few hundred of us — we were all already undressed, and we had to form <span class="DLF">lines</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was a cloudy day, very cloudy, and a very fine drizzle was going down. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And all the women were so embarrassed that they were without anything on top that they all covered their breasts with their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And they made groups and we started walking the <span class="DLF">street</span> following the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">As we were passing some of those <span class="DLF">streets</span> and there were some Ukrainians who were cheering as we were walking by. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were applauding and cheering. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But this, this what was done to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We kept on walking silently without saying anything until we were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> going towards where they were taking us, there were rows on both sides of Gestapo and German Shepherds. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we kept walking and the drizzle was coming down and I was so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was so afraid that I developed diarrhea. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But you are not allowed to talk so I didn't tell my mother anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We just kept on walking and walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And then my mother said, "Children, you have to pray to God." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And as we were walking a black cat crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> and somehow somebody said, "Okay, now you know where we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We are going to be killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But my mother said to us, "Don't think that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Don't think that way." </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we kept on walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">When we got to the <span class="DLF">field</span> and that was an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> , there were mountains of clothing from the people before that were killed and their clothing was taken off there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They told us to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> to wait to be killed and at that time the sun came out and the day was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The sun was shining. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The skies were blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And so many people standing naked in that <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And my mother was looking around and she saw this tall Gestapo man. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Very, very tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And she took a chance by walking out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and walking towards him and asked him, "Do they kill non-Jews here." </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And he looks at her and he says, "You're not Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And she says, "No, I'm not." </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And he said, "Well, what are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She said, "Well, my husband was taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He is someplace in one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> ," she said, "and I decided with my children to come and find him to visit him." </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So we were walking on this <span class="DLF">road</span> and as they were bringing down the Jews, they took us along and nobody would listen to us." </span><span class="sentence" id="88">With that, with one of his hands, he took my mother's hand, my hand, and my sister's hand and he took us out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and he said, "Come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He took us into that abandoned little <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> and he told us to sit and wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In the meantime he told my sister that she should bring some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So he took her to one of those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and she just picked up whatever clothing she was able to get for my mother, for myself and herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And she brought it in and we started putting on the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There was some other people in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and one of them was a lady with a baby in her arms, and she recognized us. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian, because the Ukrainians were collaborators, and they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They spoke — and they spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So in order for the Gestapo to understand, you know, what we were saying because we're talking to him in Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My mother was talking Ukrainian to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So this lady turns around and says to him, "They are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Why aren't they killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so he hit her, and we just sat there frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We didn't know what to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We couldn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he took us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We were already dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And he said to us — he said to the Ukrainian, "You take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You will escort them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Because you could not possibly walk on the <span class="DLF">road</span> back when this was — when they were walking all the Jews to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So the Ukrainian told us to follow him and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">As we were walking back, on the side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , of the <span class="DLF">road</span> my mother saw many of our neighbors who were walking towards the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And all she did was sigh because it was very painful to see them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So the Ukrainian didn't say anything and when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and my mother said to him, "Thank you for bringing us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ," he said to us, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We're not letting you go because you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You are Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And my mother says, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I'm not." </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He says, "Yes, you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I saw you, how you sighed when you saw them, the Jews walking that <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we have to interr....“* My mother started, of course, lying and saying, “no” and tells him the same story that she told the, the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he says, "No, we have to take you in for interrogation and, and then we'll see what happens and then we'll let you go." </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So my mother said, "Perhaps I can, you know, give you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I have some...” you know, some things she had saved whatever. “</span><span class="sentence" id="122">T'll pay you. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Just let us go." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And he said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He took us to a little <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> which was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And we were put in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> maybe was 10 by 10 with other criminals and other robbers and thieves and everything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They put us in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And every day, they would take us a few blocks from that <span class="REGION">area</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo office</span> for interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And so they were, you know, asking my mother questions and my sister and, of course, we kept telling them the same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Nothing — me they didn't touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was just my mother and my sister interrogating to see if they lied or if they were telling the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they just couldn't find anything out and this was already like three, four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">One day they decided that the only way they will be sure to find out if we are Jews are not is if they interrogate me. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I was about five and a half at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So they came to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I remember this Gestapo put me on his lap and said to me — asking me my name which, of course, we changed our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We changed our identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We changed everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And he started telling me what a beautiful little Jewish girl Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I sort of jumped at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I says, "How can you compare me to a Jewish little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I am Christian and I am — we have nothing to do — I have nothing to do with Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I don't even want to look like them." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Well, he kept interrogating me for about an hour and he kept on every second, you know, second word or third word “Jewish little girl, Jewish little girl,” and I kept saying you know, "That's not me and we're not and we're just Christians and that's all." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Well, after that they realized that you know, they're wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">That for sure we are from where we told them we were and we were going where we were going, the whole, the whole bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But then they decided after checking out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that my mother gave them, there was no one under such a name and the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There was no such address and so on and so forth — there was no such people. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They realized that there was something not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So they decided to have us interrogated again. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So the next day, we were, all of us, walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> going towards the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And of course, there was always a Ukrainian who would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> saw her and she said to her, "You are still alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="152">With that, the Ukrainian realized that we have to be Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And so after he took us — he didn't say anything, but after he took us for the next interrogation they decided that we have to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We have to be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So they brought us back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And the way the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was situated was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> were our guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So if you want — had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> , you would have to walk into their <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , ask for permission and then, you know, either they would go with you because the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> was outside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or they would, you know, or they would keep one of us like if I wanted to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> my mother would go with me, but my sister would remain in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Or vice versa whichever way. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">There was always one of us had to stay in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because they were always, I guess, afraid that we'll escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Well, after hearing between the other inmates that we are going to be killed my mother quickly thought of escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And so that evening that we decided to escape we watched the guard that was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He fell asleep so we couldn't out walk all of us together because we didn't want our inmates to be suspicious of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So my mother and I started walking out thinking that if he wakes up and asks us where we're going, we going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> and my sister remains in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But he did not wake up, and we just walked out and as we were going down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and you're supposed to turn in to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> the <span class="DLF">front door</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And so my mother said, "We go." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Now there was somebody standing in front of that <span class="DLF">door</span> , but as we came closer to leaving it the man just walked away and we ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Now, my mother did tell my sister where we're going to be so when she escapes the same way as we did then we will meet in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where some of our people — not our people, our neighbors lived and we decided that's where we're going to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And it so happened that as my sister started walking out after we had left — my mother and I had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">She started walking and he woke up and he said to her, "Where are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And she says, "I'm going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And he says, "Aw, go ahead, your mother's there with your sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Except he didn't know that we're gone already. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And so my sister escaped too. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We did meet in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> by the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And they were hiding us until we decided that the best way to hide will be in our <span class="DLF">back yard</span> where we had a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And so we told one of our neighbors that we'll be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and so she would once a day bring us something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was like two stories high. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we didn't know, of course, where my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We hadn't heard from him and he didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So here we were in our <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and this neighbor was nice enough to bring us food once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But obviously somebody noticed that she was carrying food to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there sleeping in the — you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> on the what we call it — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and everything — we just stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Somebody called the SS and they started following the lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And she realized that, so she started screaming, "Save yourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Save yourselves." </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She never made it to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> but she was just screaming loud enough for us to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So my mother and my sister quickly ran to the other end of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and with their bare hands they broke two panels of heavy wood and we jumped, we jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">From the two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> we jumped down and we started running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So by the time the Germans broke into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , we were already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Now we really hadn't no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go so we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was, of course, the other Jewish people and my father was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So we were reunited and we were there again about — let's see, that was in '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We were together until the second pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Now when they started talking about killing us again, my mother and, of course, with my father, they decided that we have to try and escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was always surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was actually with wires, <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was barbed wired and you had guards by the <span class="DLF">entrances</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So my mother and my father decided that we have to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We cannot stay for the second pogrom which was a few months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So we could not escape together. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We had to separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So my mother took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We were first to escape at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We just climbed out between the barbed wire and we went to one of our neighbors — not neighbors, to some friends that we had, Gentiles, which were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Thanks to them, I guess, we're still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then next — like an hour later, my sister and then we were reunited, my sister and my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We waited for my father and he never showed. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We didn't know what happened to him, and we couldn't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> either because the following day there was another pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So after that we were always hopeful that we will find our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">In the meantime, we had to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We had to run away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because the second pogrom was already meant to clean out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> — to clean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> out of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So my mother knew someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Of course, my mother — my father also knew this gentlemen who was a motorman on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And she paid him off, he should smuggle her and my sister out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Now, like I said before, we didn't know where my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Now she could not take me along because “A” I was too little and it was very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was in the wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And it was very cold and the clothes that we had really wasn't warm enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So she made arrangements with a Gentile lady that she should hold, you know, keep me in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then in the springtime this gentlemen who smuggled my sister and my mother out of — to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> that he will come and he will take me, too, and bring me to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The lady agreed, and my mother gave her whatever we had, you know, just to make sure that I'm safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">She lived — she had two of her grandchildren living with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They did not know that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I don't look Jewish either. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And so she kept me in back of her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">She had like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> and that — this 1s where I used to stay and I used to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In fact that <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> was so infested with, with mice that at night, I used to cover myself with a, with a blanket that she gave me and feel those mice crawling all over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">My mother had left before. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But before she left she told me that she has to go away with my sister and she gave me a hundred rubles and she told me that in the springtime this gentlemen whom I knew will come and he'll bring me back to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That it's only going to be a little while and I'm safer staying with this lady and her grandchildren here. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">My mother left, but before she did I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I said, "I have a headache. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Don't leave me." </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But she said she has to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I guess I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And so she gave me the hundred rubles and I remained in the <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">With her grandchildren, I used to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">After two weeks the lady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found tn their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> will be burned and the family will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You know, the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So she was really afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And so she told me I had to leave her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> two weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Well, at that time I was infested already with lice because nobody gave me a bath and I slept in the same clothes and I lived in the same clothes and I lived in that <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> with the mice. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And so I walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And the first thing I did was go into a — to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> — a <span class="BUILDING">religious article store</span> and I bought a big cross and I spend my hundred rubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And then I was so infested with the lice that my head, my skin was all rashes and bloody from scratching it so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And so I felt that I really needed help and I remembered this lady whom my parents were friendly with and I remembered that we used to visit them every so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">That it's quite a bit outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I didn't remember the address and I didn't remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But I just remember how we used to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I — that's how I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And I made it to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And it was winter and cold and the snow was snow maybe five, six inches of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I made it to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and as I got to her <span class="DLF">gate</span> her dog started barking so she came out to see who was at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and she sees me and she says, "My God, Come in quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Come in quick." </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And she takes me to her <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> because obviously she must have noticed that I have lice crawling all over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So she wouldn't take me into her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but she took me into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and she — quickly she took off my clothes and put on other clothes and she said to me, "Where are your parents?" </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I said, "Everybody is killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Everybody is dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Because I wanted her to have pity on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">She took me to her <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">She shaved off my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">She gave me a bath. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">She gave me a glass of hot milk and a piece of black bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I ate it so fast that I got so sick that she thought I was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And she couldn't call a doctor and she had to pull all her shades down. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Nobody should see that she has any strangers in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And she had a son who was at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she didn't want the son to know either because the son did know me and he knew that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So she gave me a bath and, and she put on one her — of her white gowns on me and it really felt good because I felt clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And she put some Vaseline on my head and she kept me in her <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for a week, a whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Now her son didn't know that until one day about three, four days later he said, "Why is your <span class="DLF">bedroom door</span> locked and the shades are down?" </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And so she felt that she had to tell him, otherwise he might, you know, he might talk about it on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then they'll send the SS and this 1s what's going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So one evening she sort of surprised him. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">She said to me, "Come in, I want you to see my son and I want him to see you." </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And when I walked in, he almost died because I was wearing her white gown and my head was shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And he just became so wild, but she said to him, "Don't you ever tell anyone that you’ve seen Frima." </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And he said, "I promise, I never will." </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And so I stayed with her for another week. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">In the meantime, like I told you when she gave me that milk and the bread and I got so sick, she didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So her husband and the lady whom I'm very grateful to, she was giving me enemas because I was already blue in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I couldn't talk and I was stopping — I was slowing down with my breathing. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That's how sick I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Well, after the war she told my mother that as she was trying to save my life she said, "At the same time I was thinking where am I going to bury your child. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I mean nobody supposed to know that there's a Jewish kid in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But anyway, I guess, God was very good to her and was good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">After a few enemas, I'm finally — I woke up and I was stronger and I was able to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And after staying a week with her, she said, you know, she can't keep me any longer because she was also afraid that people might become suspicious — her neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And so here I am without a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, without a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I knew I couldn't go back to that lady who told me to leave the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So I decided that since she had under her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she had a little — like a little opening with a <span class="DLF">door</span> , where her dog used to sleep that that's where I'm going to sleep too together with her dog, without her knowing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so what I used to do 1s walk around during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Just walk during the day and go to some of the people that I knew and they would give me a piece of bread or give me a potato and I would continue walking and walking and walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And then at night when it was already dark in the lady's house and it was quiet, I would sneak in. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And the dog knew me and he loved me and he didn't even bark. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So he used to lie on my legs, keep me warm, and that's how I slept through the night until also very, very early in the morning, I used to get up and pray to God, of course, and put on my kerchief and start walk out from the — from the — under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and just walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And one day as I was walking through the same <span class="DLF">streets</span> that I walked before I heard a couple of young boys saying, "Gee, she might be a Jew because I've seen her walking here once before." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Well after I heard this, I never walked in that <span class="REGION">area</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I just continued walking to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And one day I decided to go back in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we had a cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was a Persian cat, beautiful gray, dark gray cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And I wasn't even near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the cat recognized me and he started following me. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Now the Nazis didn't like cats. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And as I was walking and the cat was walking after me meowing and meowing, I couldn't pick him up because they knew that most of the Jewish people had cats. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And so I wouldn't pick up my cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I just kept walking and he followed me until I was passing the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And there were two guards sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they saw my cat following me and they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They killed my beautiful cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I just kept walking as if I didn't know anything and as if I — the cat did not belong to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And so I continued walking for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And that was my daily life, sleeping with the dog, walking during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And one day when I came back to sleep with the dog, I saw a light on in the <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span> and so I imagined they might be awake and therefore I should not go in, you know, go under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So next to her there was a bombarded <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There was only four <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Nothing in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Full of rubbles and wood and stones and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">That's where I lay down, between the rubbles and I — in order to keep warm because it was winter I would blow in my breathing the hot air into my jacket — 1n that little jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I wore a little jacket, a little skirt, and I had somebody's stockings and that's how I stayed through the night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And, of course, the next morning I did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I walked again. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Then the way that my mother told me that sometimes in the springtime that this gentlemen will come and pick me up and bring me to her, so I knew that when he'll come and ask the lady for me, she'll tell him she doesn't know where I am because she did not know where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">She did not know that I was sleeping under her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with her dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So when April came around, I would just circle the <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> so when I see him I would, you know, get in touch with him and he'll be able to take me to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And that's exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He came once and she said she doesn't know where I was, but then somehow he decided to come again because my mother told him that this is where I'm going to be, that she is going to keep me until he will, you know, he will come to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And so one day as soon as I was in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , I saw him and that's how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Now he made arrangements and late at night the following day he took me to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and he hid me in one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> full of coils. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And then in the middle of the night, he transferred me to a different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he just told me to lie on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , which were transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German jeeps</span> transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I met another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">She was about 10 years my senior and he was smuggling her also. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So the two of us were lying on this open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and without knowing that in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> there was a German sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He was the watchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And, of course, the gentlemen didn't know either that, you know, the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that we were on that there was danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And so we're traveling through the night towards <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Now <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , although it was occupied by the Germans, they had some kind of agreement that the Jews will not be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They will live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and work, but they will not be killed unless they're on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So it was sort of a little safer for the Jewish people to, to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We traveled through the night and then at dawn, I hear a <span class="DLF">door</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And the two of us are lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Now she had a Jewish accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So although I was a little younger, I told her not to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">She has to be quiet and they really wouldn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And we'll just make believe we're sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And we hear, you know, the Germans with those boots, those high boots, just stamping. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He was — came over to us and we just made believe that we don't, we don't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But we were sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But, of course, he kicks me in my back and I made believe I just woke up and he kicks her and he starts yelling in German and I do not speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But since I spoke Yiddish I could understand a little bit, but, of course, I wasn't going to speak to him in Yiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we, we lost my — we lost our mother, and we're looking for my mother and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Anyway, he was furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He kept yelling in German, and I kept talking to him in Russian and crying, you know, "My mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">My mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">My mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Well that was early in the morning and then about an hour later or so we were coming closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where we were supposed to get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Well, he was so furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and he made us walk down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So although I was begging and I was crying and both of us were crying, he wouldn't hear of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">He just told us to get off and he kicked us off, and there we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we're standing there and crying and crying and I kept on begging him and begging him and finally I changed his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He told us to come up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And so it didn't take too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">After that we arrived at our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , and my mother wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But some people with whom my mother was were there, and this gentlemen who was smuggling us, he brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where he was supposed to meet my mother so she can pay him. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Except the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my mother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wanted that money, of course, for the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So he threw them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And so when I came there my mother wasn't there any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">My sister wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the people told me, you know, that my mother went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was a couple of hours from that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So they took me to the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he was Jewish and his wife — they had no children and I was crying and asking him, "Where's my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I want to be with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Take me to my mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And he said — and he was trying to convince me that my life will be so much better if I stayed with them and I won't be missing anything and I'll have dolls and I'll have toys and I'll have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I kept saying, "I want my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I want my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Please get me back to my mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So finally he said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And they — there was what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> going every — once a day to different little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where, you know, some of the people lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So he got me on one of those little, little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> with a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">There were few men, and I was the only child with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And as we were traveling through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , there were always, always like groups of — I don't know if you call them bandits or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They were always used to look for Jewish people and beat them up and take everything away from them cause that's — I guess, that's how they made a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Well, they stopped our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and they started taking all the men off, because they knew we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">When I saw this, I jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and I kept running, running toward the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now this was springtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And at that time the harvest, they build those what do you call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You know, they bunched up the harvest so there was a little — like little <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and I hid 1n one of those, and I was sitting there and thinking, "Where do I go from here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And I was praying and then hours — a couple of hours later I heard horses coming in my direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And I was sure that they were looking for me, and that they were going to get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So I decided before I run to different haystacks — exactly haystacks — I should look out and see, you know, what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Well, when I looked out I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the horse, and the men on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And so I ran towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and they were, of course, very happy to see me and they kept saying how those bandits were looking for me because they noticed a little girl and I had escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So they were very angry because those men were beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Everything was taken away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And they were all injured, all beaten, but anyway they took me up and they hugged me and they kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And we finally made it to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my mother was — were assembled a couple hundred of Jewish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And that was before Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And when the word passed around that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> came with some men and a little girl, my mother and my sister knew that it had to be me so, of course, they ran out to greet me. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they was — it was so little that actually the Germans knew where the Jews lived so they didn't have to surround it or, you know, put up barbed wire or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with this Gentile man. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> and all three of us slept on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And there was — then there was another mother and a daughter that slept on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We worked in his <span class="DLF">fields</span> to pay him for sort of rent so my mother and my sister worked on the <span class="DLF">field</span> and I worked on the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">My job was digging out potatoes and carrying them to his <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , and for this I would get a loaf of bread a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">That was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We are very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We remained living there for about a year, at least a year — I'd say ’40 — °42 — for about a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And we kept working and then the day before we were liberated, the Germans had dug another <span class="DLF">grave</span> , a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> to kill all of us, like the Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And the day before their plan, the Russians were bombarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> — the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was street fighting going on and we were saved except for those Jewish people who either got killed because their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were, you know, where they stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It wasn't their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , but wherever they lived, either the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was bombarded or because of the street fighting or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Well, we were lucky to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And we went back to look for our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And all we, the news we had is that he was seen with two Gestapos walking the <span class="DLF">street</span> , down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we never heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And we didn't know that you know, all my aunts and uncles and grandparents and cousins, they're all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And we started to build up a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">My mother was the widow who tried to put our lives together. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And so she was selling and buying and selling and trying to make a go of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The shoes that I was wearing — we couldn't afford to buy anything, so I would go between the destroyed <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and rubbles and pick up rope and with a crochet needle I would crochet slippers and then put a piece of cardboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And these were the shoes I wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And, God, that's how we lived until we decided that everyone else is dead, no one is left, that we have to start a new life, and just leave Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And so we joined other Jewish people who hoped that we can escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">That was the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">We can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> perhaps we can go to different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And so we did.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay, we're rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Why don't you tell me about leaving your father at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  When my mother and father decided that we should escape before the second pogrom, I did not want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I wanted to stay with my father or whenever he'll escape I'll go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And so I was crying and I said, "Papa, I don't want to go without you." </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But he insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">He said, "You must go. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You go with Mama." </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He says, "I'll follow you. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I'll follow you." "</span><span class="sentence" id="442">I swear," he said, "We'll meet again." </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And so I listened to what he had to say and I believed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And so I, I went with my mother and we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">We made it out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And my father was, was left behind and we just don't know what happened to him except for the fact that people said they saw him walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So, so we never heard from him and nobody ever saw him alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That was the end of my father's life. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And that was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Anyway, we have to get back to where we left off. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I wanted — when my mother came to pick me up when I arrived in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they were all preparing — baking Matzos for Passover at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And my sister went and, you know, took me from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and walked me to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my mother was with the other people baking the Matzos, and my mother, of course, took me in her arms, put me on her lap, and started looking on me, checking me out, if I was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And suddenly she sees a big cross and she says to me, "My child, mayn kind.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="454">What is that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I says, "Mama, I wanted to live so I can tell you what I went through and I wanted to make sure that nobody is suspicious of me, so I had to buy the cross and make believe that I'm Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">She took it off and she gave it to one of the priest in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived and that was the same cross that I used to take off at night when I went to sleep or when I prayed to God and then put it on in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It was really big. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It was a very big cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And then walk around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> so everyone can see that I have it so nobody would be suspicious of me or have any doubts that I'm anything else but a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And this was my life for about six months until the day that I came to see my mother and my fa— and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And after the liberation — after we were liberated, we went back and—
QUESTION:  How did you get from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Again, we were going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , with whatever was available and we just made it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But we were very lucky that the day before the execution of all the few Jews that lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And it was a terrible experience seeing the fighting in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and the wounded soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We used to pull them into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and, you know, wash them and then change their socks and then and bandage their, their wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And these were the ones who, who, thanks to them, we ' My child (Yiddish) survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And then when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , most of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was destroyed, so my mother worked very, very hard selling, dealing, making dollars, and with her own hands, she put together the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">You know, like she painted it and she plastered it and she did everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And then we decided that we have to leave, that we weren't safe any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So through different, you know, different papers and different channels, my mother got us out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And then from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And we traveled for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">There were other — yeah, some Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And we made it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And then we were supposed to be smuggled from that <span class="REGION">area</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So, gosh, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was full of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So many! </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Some was sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Some were lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">When we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and the guards wanted to inspect the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to see, you know, what was 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Of course, certainly, they did not think of people, the driver — he stopped and as the guards were coming to open up and see what was doing, he took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And they started, of course, shooting, but he kept going zigzag, so he was not hit, and we, we made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And then there, of course, they had already the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camps</span> and they gave us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We stood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for a little while, and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> they would send people to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So we stayed for maybe a couple of weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> cause during that period I got sick there also. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">That's a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And when I got better they sent us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , which had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And there, there we lived, you know, in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but we were liberated and we just went on with our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">There were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> set up, and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I learned Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And the rest of the family, everyone was working and making a couple of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And then, this 1s a long story short, but I said I'm making a long story short and then we went to — from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  How did you get from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  We went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">During that period I used to we weren't working, so during that period, I used to go collect food and clothing for the Moroccan Jews who were very poor and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in a very isolated <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And every week I used to bring clothing and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And since I was young and I was able to get around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and whoever needed anything or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, to go someplace and didn't know, I would, you know, I would sort of take them around. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I was their guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And then while there, they were talking about another war. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">That was really frightening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So, we decided that instead of coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where we had to wait for a visa and it was a waiting period and we were so scared that we decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And there I had an aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">She quickly made out the papers for us — the necessary papers and did whatever was necessary and we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And lived there until I decided to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  How long was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  That's nine years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and, of course, always thinking about the past and always worry about the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Never really feeling liberated, although alive, but never really liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And then, of course, met my husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  It was a blind date. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I was going to Teacher’s Institute for Women. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I met a young lady there and we became good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And she said to me she wanted me to meet a nice Jewish fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And that's how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And we have three lovely children. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And we do think about the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We do think about the horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">My husband was in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> during World War II, and he was — they were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They did not have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> or sort of, you know, like we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They did not have pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">They had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but they did not have pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But they were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And we had the pogroms and we had starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It was a lot of atrocities going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Horrible experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Always frightened, always feeling you're being followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">In fact the nights when I used to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and I used to hear the German shepherds bark, to this date I dislike these dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And I always used to feel that any minute, you know, they will attack or something, attack me although it was at night and I used to walk like you against, against <span class="BUILDING">building</span> between, between <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> nobody should see me, nobody should hear me. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And everything brings memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">When it drizzles and it's cloudy, it brings memories of the day when they took us to be killed, the first pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">When I hear a German shepherd, it brings memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">When I walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , everything seems to bring memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It's quite frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Let's see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  How else did the war affect your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  Everything that I look at brings memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Everything that I do brings memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">For many years I had nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I used to wake up screaming and screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">For a while, I used to dream about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Just everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">If I pass a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , it brings memories of the escape, of when we jumped out of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we ran to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It just — there isn't a thing that doesn't.... When I see barbed wire, it's memories of how, how really we lived in that enclosed area not being allowed to walk, and when I walked in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> within that <span class="REGION">area</span> I had, you know, I had the stars, the yellow stars, the Star of David, one 1n the back and one up front. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And it didn't matter how old you were or how young you were, you still had to wear them. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Even in pictures, when I see a German uniform brings memories of how they beat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I mean I was lucky, but in front of me, grown-ups if they didn't move fast enough, they were beaten with sticks and they were hit with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Such horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Just horrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And just as they affect an older person, it certainly affects a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It's just that we grow up a little stronger perhaps than the elderly people do. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And my mother suffered with that ear that, that she was hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">She suffered for until the day she died she wasn't able to hear too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And it was also memories, awful memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And more memories when there's — when you lose your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">You lost so many dear ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Part of your life you lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was just a lot of anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Anger to the world for doing such things, and not to feel when all of us had to stand naked — such inhumanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">We were just made to feel like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And the beatings that one constantly had to go through there, all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Then I was, I was from the lucky ones yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Well, now when we look back we hope that the past is remembered so the future will be much better future for every human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Really for every human being cause I don't think that the world could possibly survive with such horrors like we did 1n the ‘30s and ‘40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And we hope there's gonna be a better tomorrow, which I always prayed every day while alone until I came together — reunited with my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And then when we finally made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> of America, I still don't feel free. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I don't think that a survivor will ever feel free. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">It's something that was done to his life, to his way of feeling, thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Something that nobody can understand, only the survivor himself somehow will have to sort of adjust himself to the world and do his part as a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Oh, gosh.

<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Well, during the period when I was walking the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there were days that I couldn't get any food cause I was afraid to go in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> in case somebody will see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So I was walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and I saw this <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> with a big glass window. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I looked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">There were a lot of people sitting there and eating and I was standing — I was so hungry and there was one empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> next to a gentleman so I figured may as well go in and perhaps somebody will feel sorry for me and pay for, for my soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So I walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I sat next to this gentleman and I ordered the potato soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And as I finished eating it and the waitress came to ask me for the money to pay, I started crying and I told her I had lost my money. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So the gentleman next to me, I guess, felt sorry and he said to me, "Don't cry, little girl," and he paid for my soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And I just ran out very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I didn't say a word, I just thanked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I ran out and continued walking and walking and walking until the night came and I went back to my little dog under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">As far as how people, people that wanted to help us out and they wanted to offer us food some of them would offer what they had and that was pork and other meats, but coming from a background like we did, we refused the type of food that they offered us since it's not kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So we always kept in mind who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We could not show it. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We could not tell anyone about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But we felt this is what we are and no matter what happens we have to remain with our way of being who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">We are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">There was no two ways about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And so every night when I used to go to sleep with my dog, I would take my cross off and pray to God, and then in the morning before I put the cross on, I would pray to God again. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Put it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Shake off the straw because when I got up from the straw and with my dog, I started walking again. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And that was the story for six months until the gentleman came and smuggled us to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">This is just some of the stories.</span></p>
