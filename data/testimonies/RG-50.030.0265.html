<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can you give us your name, and where you were born and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I'm H. Margaret Zassenhaus. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And the "H" is an old German name, Hiltgunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Almost too difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">That 1s why I shortened off. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , quite a few years ago as you can guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  What year? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Can you give it to me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  (laughter) Do I have to say this? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Yes, I was born in 1916. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That means really during world war number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I will tell you my father was a rather known educator in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I had a mother who was just a mother but a mother who I remember as probably the best mother ever could be because she really would over and over encourage us, have the courage to form your own opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">This is what I remember when I think of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had three brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My oldest brother, Hans, was a professor, became a professor in mathematics was he in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And my second brother, Guntra (ph) is a physician as I and he lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then I had a third brother, who was also a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was killed in the war, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  And what was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  That was Vilfreet (ph), which means in English will peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And he was the one who was killed in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So, we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">As soon as the Nazi's came, my father was . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Three SS (ph) men came into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and took him by the arm and led him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He was the head of a very fine <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> where he really taught the liberal ideas and the classical ideas of and how people should live with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So, we were very grateful to a point that at that point he already had Parkinson's disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So they, for the time being, did not arrest him because he was a rather known man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He had written several books about the history of literature, and so they tried to go light about tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So, I can only say almost fortunately soon after the Nazis came, he died, because his fate otherwise would have been to be in one of the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I had three brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My eldest brother, my oldest brother, Hans, he was a professor in mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And later as I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where he was both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> and in other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And my second brother, was physician as I, and lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Then I have a third brother, Vilfreet (ph) was his name, but really means to will peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But he was the one who was killed in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  What was it like as children together in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">How do you remember it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, one of my most wonderful memories are those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And one of my saddest memories is that day when Hitler finally came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">televisions</span> , but we had the radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And everywhere, even in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , they blared out the Hitler music. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I remember very well my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He assembled us that same night in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And he said, "Look now, you see what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I want you to know that in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , nothing will change. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We will have the same values. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We believe the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We will be the same as we always are." </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But, he said, "We've got to be extremely careful now because we are known." </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My father was a very known educator in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he said, "You must learn to be quiet, not to shout 'Heil Hitler’, but to be quiet on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because this is the only hope we can survive this." </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And true enough, the next morning several of his SS (ph) men came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They wish to come early so that they knew you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They asked for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But my father at that time already had a rather advanced case of Parkinson's disease, which really was a blessing because they couldn't transport him and they would have had all kinds of things to get him out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And since my father was a rather known man, a rather known educator in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they were a little bit afraid to begin this, to rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So, they left him alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I can almost say since and very soon afterwards, he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So, he was spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But the very same day after that happened, that the Nazis came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I remember too well my father got us all together -- us four children and a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And he said, "Now you see what has happened, what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> everything will be the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">On the contrary, for now on we will be much more together than we ever been before. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I urge you not to be afraid." </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I remember that today. "</span><span class="sentence" id="67">Don't be afraid." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Because known as my parents were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> we were really very much a target of being arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And the only reason that my father was not arrested because they came... At that time he was already so far advanced in his disease that they just let him alone and said, "Well, he's dying anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He's gone." </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, that was the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I will tell you from there on, we really were about the closest knit family you ever have seen or ever have experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Because we lived in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We had our values as we always had. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We could be open with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And very soon we got a tiny little radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You see, many, many years ago, you didn't have all these wonderful television and radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You got a tiny little radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We never were very interested in radio, but for now on we always start to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Do you know what we were looking for? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Finally, one day we found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The radio from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">That was...
QUESTION:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Finally we got a voice from freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And from there on really morning, noon and night, whenever we had a spare minute, we listened to that radio which gave us the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I never forget that because it was almost an obsession. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Don't ask me for television because we didn't have it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We had only very tiny little radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So, it was not all terrible grief because somehow this brought us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And our Jewish friends -- and we had quite a few Jewish friends- we'd gather together. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Not anymore in the daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We came to them in the dark, after night. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Or they came to us 1n the dark of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And very soon, of course, things got very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I mean, Hitler was very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He had a way of finding the elite and try to decapitate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It's an old system of any dictator. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">If you do that, of course, the rest will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And, so, the arrest came at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I must tell you that my father not only was a very known educator, but he had also written the books about the literature (ph) and was really known all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And the Nazis knew that he was quite ill already, so they let him be. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But I remember one day an SS (ph) man coming to us and he said, "Just remember you better be very quiet because you are observed." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And that we felt very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But now, none of us has ever been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, we were very fortunate that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And now, so, it was very difficult so far because what they did indirectly they tried to harm us. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We didn't have too much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">To study in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">This was really a question of having money. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And what they did is they simply cut out all the assistance, which otherwise gifted children and people who didn't have all the means to study, all this was cut away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Because they said, "Well, you are not Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You're not in the Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">If you show us good will, we will help us." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And that good will did not come forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So, from there on really our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was more or less like a beehive. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">From morning to night -- and that started about in '34 -- we had children from all kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> whom we tutored. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And this really could get the money for our daily living. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Because the very same day when Hitler came to power, three SR (ph) men came through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my father and was to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">office school</span> -- and said "this is it", and led him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was a tremendous fortune that they didn't arrest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We understood why they didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My father was a very known educator all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he had written quite a number of books. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And to begin this, they went rather lightly on it, of the very prominent people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Was he a known anti-Nazi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  He was a known Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Social Democrat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yeah -- No, he was the Democratic Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He was a very religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My mother was a very known Social Democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My father always called her his left wife, you know? (</span><span class="sentence" id="134">laughter) He was more. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I think he was a thinker. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He was a philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">A man who really stood for political and this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He was an ethicist, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">A man we admired greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The good this was first he was invited out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That had to be expected because they all knew where he stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But the good thing that he wasn't arrested was that he, at that time, already had Parkinson's disease and was really rather ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So, they left him alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They even came one day and they said, "Well, at this point, we will leave you alone because you are rather known in the community" -- over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , really, his name -- "But we warn you. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We warn you." </span><span class="sentence" id="146">With that they left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Dr. Zassenhaus, you had an incident in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  ... when the Nazis took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Could you talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Very soon after Hitler came to power, the new order was passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">For now on, whenever a teacher entered the class at the end of six times every day -- different teachers - we had all to race and then we had to throw our right arm in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and shout as loud as we could, "Heil Hitler". </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now don't forget, I was at that time about 15 or 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I immediately said, "That I can't do." </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told my parents about the new order. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was very disturbed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I'd look at the faces and hope that they would give me some advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I remember so very much my father said, "What will you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I said, "I will not do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And he said, "Well, are you aware of the consequences?" </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And my mother said to me: "Hiltgunt, this is something you must decide for yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I never forgot that. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I looked at her, because somehow I hoped she would give me some advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So, the next morning before I left, they asked me both, "What have you decided?" </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I said, "Tell me." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">My father said very quietly, "You must decide this for yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was one of the days which were very decisive in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I remember I come into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I was on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">All the girls knew about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They knew because not -- I was not very important, but my father was rather known. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Everybody knew where he stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And know since the order had been passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Whenever the teacher would enter, we would have to raise our right arm and shout, "Heil Hitler." </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And so the teacher comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I stood there, my arms glued at my sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She beckoned me to her and she said, "Now as of tomorrow you will say “Heil Hitler” and you will raise your right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I give you 24 hours to think about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">That was one of the most upsetting days. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I told my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I asked them, "What am I to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">What shall I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I never forgot the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My mother said, "You must decide for yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In the evening, I remember my father came to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedside</span> and he said, "Are you aware that whatever you do might be the end of your education?" </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I spent a sleepless night. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I've never forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I still remember it as it was today. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The next day I come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">All the students in my <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> they're very eager now they all knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">My father being so known, they wanted to what is she going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I remember as today, it was a beautiful day in Spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Everything was so beautiful <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">There was not a decision to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And don't forget, I was just a very young person, probably very immature. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The teacher comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">All the heads, arms up. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The heads all turn to me, what will she do? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">In my desperation, I raised my left arm and I put it right through the open <span class="DLF">window</span> until the glass broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">There was a general scream: "What has she done?" </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Blood poured from my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I was rushed to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That was the end of that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I must tell you, nobody ever looked into my direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They just left me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Somehow, and as today after so many years, I think maybe it was very foolish. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But somehow for me it was the beginning of the way I had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So many times now I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Why did I do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Why not just go along with that little? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But, no, in retrospect I feel that was the decisive moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I had to do what I later would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The interesting thing is for now on, from then on, never anybody looked into my direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They just let me do as odd ball (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They said hear no nothing, see no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Since then, I passed my examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They let me go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so that I could study later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  Why do you think they .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Is it because of . . .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Certainly not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I think it was because of the reputation of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">He was himself a very know educator in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">He had written books. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Books which are still studied and learned about, learned from. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And so I think it was really more a silent gist -- hear no nothing, see no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So, they let me through. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I passed my examination -- the only way I could to enter <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">However, my feelings, the feelings of my family, were exactly the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I had the feeling I could not live any more in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I would not be happy there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I just couldn't wait any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So, what I decided is that I one day said I have somewhere to go that 1s next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was really <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">About five hours away. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">This is where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">This is how I started to get interested in the Scandinavian languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  And that was the summer after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  The summer after high... When after I had my examination, it was really finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So, that began the idea why shouldn't I study Scandinavian languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Yes, and that is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And that took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Of course, at the time I had all my examination, my degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the amazing thing 1s now in retrospective, maybe really there is somebody higher than me who leads us to what we have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Because it was an outrageous idea to study Scandinavian languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It's very rare, and really not much you could do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And my parents always asked me, "Is it really what you want to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">What will you really do with it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Somehow I felt .. . [</span><span class="sentence" id="252">had been there on a visit that was a visit that was a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I liked that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There was no Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So, here comes the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Here come all the arrests of the Scandinavian people because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And, of course, the old principal of Hitler prevailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He always arrested the elite of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to decapitate the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">That was a very cheap little trick to do, which it somehow always paralyzed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So this elite now came to... I'm jumping now. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I come now from '33 to the war -- to '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And as soon as he invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He goes to the elite. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Spiritual (ph) elite was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Anybody who resisted Hitler, they were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And now they had the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They got them, brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where people simply were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">As you know, as we all know here. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But they such overflow, and also there was one good thing for the Norwegian and Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They were non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">This idea of Hitler -- northern (ph) -- this idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So, somehow that saved them from coming there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They were sent to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The <span class="BUILDING">German prisons</span> were no fun either, I can assure you. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But yet they starved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They were ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But they were not murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And now these things where I come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They needed now for these <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> somebody who spoke the Scandinavian languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And here comes the mystery of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Believe it or not I was the only person in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had the necessary academic degrees for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That I could work at the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Supervise them, send out the mail (ph), send out anything, any outside connection they might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Why would they be sent there in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Why was no one killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">See, there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">In the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> , you didn't just kill people. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So, they needed to do the academic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And Hitler himself had to agree that I was the person, because I was the only one who had all the academic examinations 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That was very important for that kind of position.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  And was your being a woman an issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  And the problem was of course the anger, deep anger of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I was not only a woman, I was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That was very hard for them to swallow as I noticed in the years that follows --these four numb years where I know for now on traveled from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other in German whenever there was Scandinavian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What kind of prisoners were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was the elite of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because, as you know so well, Hitler's method was whenever he invaded another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , simply to arrest the elite in order to decapitate the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was an old trick I think that's been done for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And he did that very skillfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So, we had the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> full of the elite of all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> wherever he invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And people who resisted, who did anything of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">If you didn't do anything, you could probably get by pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But you can imagine the spiritual elite this will always be in the leadership if ever it is to be offered. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So that is how I came into this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  What was the first job that you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  The first job was first they asked me to come into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And then they saw, of course, affluent in Scandinavian languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I had all my academia. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">That was the aggravating thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There was no other person in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had that degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And the much worse problem was I was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That was very hard for Hitler and his people to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But still it was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and it took a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">These things are always slow, as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Yes, take her because we have nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Now why did they at all allow people into <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> in and out? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">See, there 1s again the German bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">You had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- and people usually don't know that in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- we had two ways of imprisonment. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The one was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which we all know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That was simply, I mean, you were poisoned or you were hanged or you were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I mean, that was death by chance that somebody survived, as most of them were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But in the prisons of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there was still a system. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And there was still the German authority who had done it all their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">This was done this way and this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And lucky those, the elite, who were shipped off to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Why were they shipped off there in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Because Hitler had somehow tend to adore all Norwish Aryan (ph) types. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I guess it is known in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And somehow it must be this. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I mean, I cannot find any explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">These people more or less were shipped off to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were, of course, so filled already by all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that somehow the Norwish people lived, by this idea of Norwish are special. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So, that's really probably saved their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Now the situation in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">However, you did not have the Gestapo there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">That's what people don't realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There you still had the old functionaries, the old rules of <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">The people starved, they died of illnesses, but they were not put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And also they had the old order. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">For example, they could write letters and they could also get once in awhile a visitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And see this is where I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The Scandinavian ministers --they one day applied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They wanted to visit the prisoners from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And since again the Nazis had somehow an adoration of everything which was Norwish- non-Jewish, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Norwish. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He said yes, fine, they can do that, but only under strict supervision and only a person who 1s totally accepted and has all the examinations. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And, believe it or not, the only person in all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was I who had this famous stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was a famous stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And much to the horror of the Nazis, not only did I have this stand but I was only a woman, which was really an offense to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But there you see again the German -- what should I say-- the stick stick to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They wanted to have done by the letters in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">From there on for the next following four years during all the war time, I traveled from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">What was what I have to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I had to send out all mail, which went out and in. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Because, yes, in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> , the prisoners could send letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But they were, of course, you should strike, strike out whatever you wanted not to be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  You were a censor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They told me to strike out as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Whatever you don't like, you strike out. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">However, I was the only sender there, so I was the sender of a sender of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So, more or less I could really do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And that is how it begun. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I, little by little, only read the letter first. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I didn't see the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I only read the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And when I saw that a letter was too impersonal, too badly written by a prisoner, too much afraid, I put some things in. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I put some little notes by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">This and this, and everything is alright, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I put that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Of course, not in my own handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I tried, at least, to do other hand writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So, little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And then, of course, the good thing was I again had to send out also what came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So that I struck out. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So, I mean, it was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">That went about almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Then came the idea about there in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Any prisoner is allowed to have so many visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Could we go back for a moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Wasn't there, before you were doing those letters, at some point you were given a special assignment to get the letters from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that were going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  Can you explain what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  That happened . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">since I had this examination, I was hired for the censorship between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Both <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and, not <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And so whatever I did not like, I found objectionably, I could strike out. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You see? </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And so what I used to draw in the course of years -- not right a way of course -- but later on when I was feeding the Scandinavian prisoners, I'd send little notes to them and let them know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Because I was the only one who sent out these letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And that is the letters between the prisoners and the relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So I could do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">For example, it was very important for me to give them one message which was very harmless but of most important, most important. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">These prisoners really were starving to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But since they were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , there was one rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They could get every six months a peso (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And in that peso (ph), they could have some chocolate, something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">What you say oh what does it mean every six months? </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Well, it was two pesos (ph) a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It was some little light. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And so what I did in my letters going to them with a thick (ph) hiding my own writing, I put to each "send pesos (ph), send pesos (ph)". </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Because the relatives didn't even know that, of course, that they could send pesos (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And very little, very fast where it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It took about three, four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">The first pesos (ph) arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The authorities were furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were furious because it was work to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Why should we? </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But it was a rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">In these <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> there was rule they could have a peso (ph) twice a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  So, were you supposed to cross out...
ANSWER:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  ...1fa prisoner asked for something, you were supposed to cross it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  That was the rule, idea now. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I was asked whenever they would say send food, I should simply cross it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The good thing was that I sent out the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Very soon, of course, I'm sure they were told you must not even ask for it, because it was not anywhere in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But I would scribble it myself, "send food", in the letters. "</span><span class="sentence" id="420">Send food", you know, with a different handwriting of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was reaching them and so the pesos (ph) kept on arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The authorities were furious and they came to me and complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I said, well this is really unheard of, but if I were you a rule is a rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Do you want to break a rule? </span><span class="sentence" id="425">That's fine by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I don't mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But it's your responsibility, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And, yeah, no we cannot break a rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We have to give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So, they got these pesos (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="431">That was one good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They kept on hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Mind you, we had two systems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">That's very hard for people to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">One was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where people simply were gassed or killed or starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But the other was still a system with certain rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">This is where I had come in, fortunately, and could really do my part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  How did you come to think of doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Well, that was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I had studied Scandinavian languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I loved <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I don't mean that. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I mean you were adding things. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">This was dangerous for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  Certainly it was dangerous for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But you see, I was the only one who sent that. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was really in charge of the whole mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And so the only thing I had to fear, of course, that somebody eventually would get the good idea to send the mail again. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But they never did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">See, they were not all that smart as you think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  Were you in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  See, no, I put the letters from the prisoners mailed directly to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  To your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  To my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And then from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I mailed them back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and then they were mailed by postage over to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But they also had to pass them the censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">See, the ordinary censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But they again didn't know the rules of the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So we had two forces working against each other, and it worked marvelously. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, I was tremendous in hiding in different handwriting so that I had to be very careful because, you see, there were some people that might pick that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Amazingly, it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">This went on for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">That was one way I could help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But very soon fate came to me in the form that the counsels and the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , the authorities, they started to talk with the German Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They said, "Look, this is a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> our people are in. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Why can't they have visit from us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And so they asked at last, "Who is us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They said, "Well say, for example, two ministers could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Two people who are appointed by us." </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They said, "Yes, we accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That will be alright." </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Because it was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That was a rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a rule is a rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They said, "But then we will have to have somebody who supervises these visits again who 1s on our side." </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And this somehow, of course, had to know Scandinavian languages, had to be fluent in Norwegian and Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And, you know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , again, it was... that was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">There were many people who spoke Danish and Norwegian, but you had to have the academic examination, a doctorate, the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And here I really can only thank God interfered. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I was the only person in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had that examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That was very difficult to swallow for the authorities, but they had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The order had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Yes, that would be alright now. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Because it was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And from there on, for the following years and years and years, I would be the person totally in charge of the mailing, of the censorship, and of any visit they would get. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Now they would have to find people who would visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">There was a good thing that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is a <span class="DLF">seaport</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We had always had a Norwegian and Danish pastor as evident. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Because he was there not for prisoners, but he was sent for the sailors, for the Norwegian and Danish sailors. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So, the news idea came from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Why don't we try to get these pastors there? </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And so this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">One day, I get the visit of a Norwegian and of a Danish pastor. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They identified themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They said to me, "We have gotten our permission." </span><span class="sentence" id="500">It took them about months and months, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But we have got the permission from the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> that we can visit the prisoner if you would be willing to take the censorship of the letters and of our visits. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And I said, "This is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">That can be done." </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I said, "But I have to see how far this goes in my". </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And so I contacted the authorities, the German authorities, and was very angry and said, "Now here's another work I have to do, and how would that work because I have soon had enough of it all." </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And anyway I put my words in a way that they started to beg (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They said, "Well, an order is an order, and you're the only person who can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Couldn't you please help us out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I said, "Well, I don't really will so, but I will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It will be my duty." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I said, "If that is what the authorities want, I will do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">That was where it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">From there on now, we had everything the way we wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">To begin with, it was very amusing because these two pastors .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">understand that these are two ministers very afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And they mistrusted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I could very well understood this. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But it took about, I would say, 35 minutes, and they began to feel (laughter) . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">they began to feel that this was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">From there on we started to do our work the following four years about. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We traveled first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We saw first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But little by little, the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> were filled all the political prisoners from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Then we got the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We got <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> that were bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Little by little, they were all removed into all kinds of parts in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , away from where the main attacks were. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And so there it started now that we would have to travel from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other in the following years. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Officially, I was the supervisor of these two pastors who visited the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I was to, of course, make sure that nothing was said which was not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I had to do censorship of all their mail, all their contacts between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Of course, I was in total charge that nothing was done which was a... So, this started the work which now then followed in the four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I was very happy to say that I did it my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I did it frankly in a way that my two pastors were sometimes very angry and felt I took too many chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They said one day very angry, "We can't go along with it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">You do too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">First you lose your head and what happens then?" </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They were, of course, I could understand, they were afraid for their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I never forgot that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I looked at the two of them and I said: "You know, I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I would rather lose my head than my heart." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And so that's a tune (ph) for there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I'm happy to say that they will not die, that maybe soon I can say at that time I did all that was necessary and what could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It still makes me very, very happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  Can you describe to us specifically, when you first went into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> with the ministers, how did you begin to think about the things you could do? </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Because you begin to bring in things to the prisoners that were...
ANSWER:  You know it was obvious from the letters they wrote that they would instruct their wives not to write anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But you begin to read between <span class="DLF">lines</span> when you read many letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You know, I read thousands and thousands of letters in the following years. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I could see what enormous need they were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">They were simply starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I mean, they got minimal rations which was-- how do you describe? </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I mean, the lunch I just had would have been two full days of nourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I mean, it was just -- 1t was very hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They were all, of course, emaciated (ph) people who saw them and who once in awhile had maybe a commission to see them where they barely could recognize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They were like muscle (ph) men, we called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I mean, it's hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">But I could see that was the first thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They needed something which would keep them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">To begin, I had only my bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I always made sure that I had a big bag, like this bag back here. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I started with vitamin tablets. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I thought that is easy to put in the bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Now my two ministers could not have done anything who visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">You see, they were the one who had gotten the permission to visit once in awhile, because it was still <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">There was a still a certain order and aggravation. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They couldn't do this, and they didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They were probably very afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I could very well understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And so what I did was really my own risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I felt I needed to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So, I started with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And in this bag, what could I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We saw on a day maybe 30, 40 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Very little, very little you could have in such a bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Little by little, I got a very good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Then about on the second month, my goodness, we have all these terrible air raids in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I have to think for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I have to carry around all I belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So, I start first with a little handbag. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And they looked, the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And they said, "Well, what is that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I said, "That is all I have." "</span><span class="sentence" id="584">How do you mean?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="585">Because we travel now over all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I said, "If a bomb comes, if I'm bombed out, that is the only thing I have." </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And wouldn't you think that they would have done the bright idea and said wouldn't you open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Because everybody else who entered and left had to open. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">However, they came to think I was appointed by the highest authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And I always, of course, very leisurely said I'm so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They all knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They were afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So, nobody ever in all these years asked me just once, "open it". </span><span class="sentence" id="594">By the grace of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I think there was again the idea of authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Very often they looked at me and I knew exactly what they thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I would have thought the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They would think how 1s it possible that she can do all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Come in and out, and especially I was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">That was very hard to perceive. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I think that was the saving grace because I could read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They thought if that is really a woman only, there must be very special with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">She must be special. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So, more or less, I think they thought I was over and beyond the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And, believe it or not, in all these years this worked and was really I can always say by the grace of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  Where did you get the vitamins from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Now, of course, I knew the first thing to do is what can you do in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> which 1s of greatest importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And I felt these people were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I wish I could have afford to give them bread or anything, but the most important thing was something which was small and which could give some general strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So I needed now vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Now I went around begging for vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">There were not much vitamins because everybody needed vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Everybody was in a very deplorable situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself as the years went by, really had not much to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But nothing which could be compared with the miserable shape in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So, little by little, I said in the letters, who I send them myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I was the authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I said send parcels (ph), send vitamins. "</span><span class="sentence" id="619">Send vitamins" -- I put that and scribbled that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And not long the settings came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Came in, came in, came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Then I said again, I want to be in charge of these parcels. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And since I was in charge of the whole thing, they .... So, we had the vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">What they couldn't send, I got through my underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which, of course, by that time also built up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Now its this Mr. Jenkins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  It was Mr. Jenkins. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">You see, I left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is a posh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which is very good because all the Danish and Norwegian moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They had to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and deliver the merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And they had a man there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I had met a captain there by circumstances who was in charge of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and loading. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And so very soon I developed a very hearty friendship with this man and I think he knew exactly what was going on, but he was a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">He was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">A very good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So, we never spoke about what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But we did it in silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">He brought me the things I needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He came whenever I wanted to help and he gave it to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Did you ask him for vitamins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  I told him that I needed vitamins for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I said, "You see, I'm only woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I have a very important job." </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I told him, "I have to deal with the Scandinavian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I have to keep my strength up." </span><span class="sentence" id="645">He didn't say, he didn't make a comment, but at the end of our conversation -- I never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">He got up and he said, "You know you're really a very tiny person. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">But I think you need a lot of them." </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I looked him straight in the face and said, "And a lot, and a lot." </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And he said, "I will remember." </span><span class="sentence" id="650">From there on, I got all the deliveries. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">It was really wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It all was somehow . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I must tell you, I'm not a person that goes to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You know, people are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But I began to believe that help is given. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Where you really pray for help or you want to help or you really wanted this all your help. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Because I can only say I could not have done all this work alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Help was given tome. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And there came in these vitamins by the most wonderful circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It would take much too long here to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I was never running out of vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Even if I wrote my brothers, who were now as physicians in the army, sent me vitamins. "</span><span class="sentence" id="663">I need vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I am very hungry." </span><span class="sentence" id="665">They knew, of course, what I meant (laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And so I got them from everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Help was given. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I never ran out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And that would somehow help these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  Did you get medicine as well from this doctor...
ANSWER:  Of course, little by little also the medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There was no medicine, certainly not for the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I began to collect medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I had our own doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Our own physician was a man, a very right-winged German, very -- how should I say —patalotic (ph), and yet he was a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I mean, I could see what the Nazis did, he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">You see, there was still a little different being a patalotic(ph) German, but being a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">There was a little bit difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  I tried to do it by groups because, see, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> I had 800 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">In order to cover as many people as possible, I always tried to have four, five, six people at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">See, there is a miracle of the human heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I call it the miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">None of these people ever revealed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">See, if only one of them had said something -- one of the prisoners -- they would have had some. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">They would have gotten more bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They would have gotten some things, some reward. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">None of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">See, and that in a time when I believed in the human heart was almost nothing anymore, that restored my belief. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">That these people in the greatest need they were, they knew exactly why I did it and they knew that this had to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Of course, don't forget these people were not criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">These people were the elite of <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> who had been arrested solely for the reason that they had been brave enough to try to lift Hitler's regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But I will say still people who were starving, who... hopefully you've never starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">People who really starve -- I had learned that in my own life — it takes a tremendous ethical way of being and thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">That you don't almost do anything just for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I learned that in my life how difficult it is -- what starvation really means. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So I will say this experience with my prisoners, my 800 prisoners, which little by little I had to deal with, that nobody ever revealed on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Why I'm sure that particular prisoner who would have done that would have been emptied the water (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="744">That have really restored my belief in the human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">A belief which had been always distorted by the Nazis and by the things I had to fear in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And whenever I have moments where I'm still sad about the human heart and what people can do, I think of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I think that was for me the greatest reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  Did you get to know some of these prisoners better than others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Oh, they became my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">All of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">All 800. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">They became my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">They became my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I loved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I became for them, you know, I think really, it was for them, that was there <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">That was all they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Don't you see that went on over four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">The hardest moment was to part because there the one day in the middle of the night, and all shipped back to <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The best we could hope for. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They were not gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They were not killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And so now it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They became extremely for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I remember one day shortly after the war, a man totally knocked at our <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">One of the great moments of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We opened and he said, "I'm coming for Hiltgunt." </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He said in Norwegian. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I said, "Are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He said, "I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">But, I'm not one of your prisoners," he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="771">But they sent me. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">They want you to know that they have not forgotten you and that we try everything possible that we can come in contact with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And so it took about one and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was really hermetically sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But little by little, the first pastors arrived, it was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And little by little, the first people arrived in uniforms, and English uniforms and American uniforms, whatever they could get a hold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">My former prisoners came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  So they came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  They came to visit me after the war, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So the British authority, they were very strict, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They didn't know even of what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But they very soon came and told them all about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And so the connection was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Not long afterwards, I was given the official invitation to both <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> to visit them on our official state visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was one of the great moments of my life when I arrived there and in front all the prisoners who had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">It's one of the great moments of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  And you received the medal .. . ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I received these decorations. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I was very happy about. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But, the greatest decoration was really that I could get them out alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">That was something so wonderful a feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Yet I was very grateful for all the honors later that came. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">But the importance was really that I could do when it was needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I think that we need to remember now how much we human owe to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I think sometimes we forget that because now we have times, of course, where we have relatively comfortable situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We have no wars going on, or big wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">But I think we must never forget what we as individuals can really do for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So often, for example, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I hear that they should do this and they should do that. "</span><span class="sentence" id="801">They" meaning this unknown authority, whoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And each time I cannot but say who 1s "they"? </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Well, that authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Well don't you think it's a good idea to ask myself what I could do? </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And so little by little, of course, when the things -- when I wrote my book, "Walls"(ph), and when things got known, the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> got very interested in, to hear about it more. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And so I now since several years that you might know have been traveling from one <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They wanted to find out what really was happening at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And more and more, they also ask the question, why would you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Why would you have taken the risk? </span><span class="sentence" id="810">It makes me always a little bit sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I look at them and say, "Why should I not have done it? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">What would you have done?" </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And sometimes the answer is silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And I don't resent that because that is really the question each of us has ask yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">If you come in such a situation, what would you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I mean, this is somebody can decide that for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">What makes me sad, I must tell you this, is how today in our community of people how often I hear these kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Well, those Jews or those blacks and those this and those that. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">How much of prejudices we still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I think in many ways, the war is still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">It's my prayer, now I'm old, that we begin to learn that the human condition 1s really one we all have in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And before we don't fully understand it-- yes, before we don't fully understand it -- there will always be the possibility of another Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And that is really my prayer, if I have any prayer left, that we begin to understand that the human condition is that what we all have in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And if we fully understand this, and I'm proud to say that in this environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">If we begin fully to understand it, then I think there is hope for this troubled world. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Dr. Zassenhaus, can you describe your family life with your brothers and your parents and how they raised you, and with what values they raised you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I must tell you that my father had studied religious literature and history. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He was an educator and very soon became the head of a rather prestigious <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where he also taught a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">He taught mostly ethics and literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">My mother was a free spirit, which you can see in those days this was very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Already with age 15, she moved into another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because she came from a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , where she was a the first woman in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> took her full education, her full degree in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was very unusual at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Fortunately, she met there the head of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and fell in love with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And that became my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">So they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">She never went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , which she actually had wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Don't forget, it was a different time. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">My father very soon was called to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to a very prestigious <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there where he became the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Not only that, he also taught history and religion, and wrote the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which became a very important book and it’s still read in the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So that was a background I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I would say the ideas of Hitler were as far from our family as the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And I remember so very well the very day, the 30th of January, when suddenly now through all the loud speakers -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">televisions</span> we didn't have at that ttme. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Loudspeakers came "the Fuhrer has the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Adolf Hitler has come to power." </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It was to us almost as somebody shook us and said "the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is on fire". </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Especially we were four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I had three brothers, all one year apart, and I was the young sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">When my brother studied at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , I was still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I remember as it had been today, although it was, I think, 200 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Our parents assembled us all together at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and my father said, "From now on, things will be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Everything has changed." </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And my mother added, "But one thing remains the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , everything will be same. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We will be now one family who totally stands together. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> has to become a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Whatever you say <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , it has to be mainly in silence because somehow we have to try to survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And very well the next day we found out what she meant with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I woke up to a total dark room, although it was a light day. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I could not know what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I saw at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and a hush through the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And I saw all our <span class="DLF">windows</span> were sealed with swastikas, with paper, and darkened by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Because my father was a rather known educator in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had written books about education and so they wanted to show us now what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And if we didn't know, my father, of course, immediately was without a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">He was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">At that time, he was already quite ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">He had Parkinson's disease in a rather progressed shape already. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I think that really saved his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">He was so well-known a person that to begin with, the Nazis more or less tried to tread lightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And so they let him be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and let him die in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">A couple of months later, he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And now here my mother was with four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I was about 16 or 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I remember my first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">The teacher, a wonderful teacher whom I adored, she taught us history. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">She came into our <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">She was very pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">That is what I noticed immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And she said, "Well girls, I must tell you from now on everything will be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And the first thing I will tell you from now on whenever a teacher enters the <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , you all have to get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">You have to raise your right arm and have to shout as loud as possible 'Heil Hitler’. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">That's the way it will be." </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I knew her well enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I saw the tears in her eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I was disturbed by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Why would she even tell us that? </span><span class="sentence" id="888">How could she tell us? </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I told my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I saw they became very silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And somewhat later, they came to meant they said, "Well, what will you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I said, "Well, what am I to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="895">What do you think I should do? </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Give me advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I cannot raise my right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I will not do this kind of thing." </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And they said, "Well, I think we will all think about it somehow." </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And so the next morning before I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they came again to meant they said, "Now what have you decided?" </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And I said, with tears in my eyes, "What do you think I should do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I was desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">It was probably one of the really most desperate days of my life, because my father looked very seriously at me and he said, "Hiltgunt, you must decide for yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Totally in that moment, it was the first time that I really felt very alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So, I come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had my <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">It was a wonderful day in spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">That was about when this order had been passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Simply for now on should all raise our and place our arm "hail Hitler". </span><span class="sentence" id="909">The teacher enters the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Now all these girls stood straight, raising their right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Curious as they were and as much as these little girls were, they knew where I stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The heads all were bent to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">What will she do? </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And in my desperation, I took my left arm and I threw it through the open <span class="DLF">window</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="915">The glass fell, blood fell from my arm! </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Here you see still the scar. (</span><span class="sentence" id="917">laughter) I was rushed to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to be sewed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I must tell you, I still consider it the scar of my honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And from now on, I will tell you, nobody ever looked in my direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">They simply left me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And I stood there alone some down there and thought, well, well, but they didn't say anything, and just did nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Really it was by the grace of God, or maybe rather by the doubtless respect they had for my father who was really a known educator, that they simply overlooked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They let me be. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">That was really the reason that I still was allowed to remain in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that they simply ignored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">That was the best they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">The other way they would have simply would have to tell the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">They didn't do that, thanks to the reputation of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I passed my examination and I was on my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  Tell me, before that incident happened, you were given an assignment to go to a Hitler rally. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">This is before January 30...

QUESTION:  What did you write 1n this essay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  I wrote the essay about Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I remember I closed with the words "Hitler is psychotic." </span><span class="sentence" id="960">With all the rest of my 17 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And only two days passed and I saw my teacher coming very pale tome. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And she said, "Take this back. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Take this back and tear it apart." </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And I said, "Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="965">That is what I mean." </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And she looked at me, "Can't you see what you're doing to me, and what you're going to do to you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And so she just simply didn't want anything to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Now, of course, being a much older person, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">But I couldn't understand this at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Then when the order was passed that for now on whenever the teacher entered the class and for each class, we would all shout together and raise our right arm and shout "Heil Hitler". </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I came very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I told my parents about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And I saw how serious they looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Give me advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">What can I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="977">What shall I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I will not do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And I never forgot, my mother said, "You must decide that for yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="980">That was a moment I felt very lonesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">So the next day arrived and I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">The school girls in the class then knew, of course, from before where we stood, and what I would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">The teacher comes into the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">She had told me the day before, "Hiltgunt, don't make it too difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Just think now." </span><span class="sentence" id="986">She was a very dear teacher.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">ANSWER:  You know, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">They said, "Why are you stubborn? </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You want to study, you want to -- just give in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">What is so difficult that you give in a little bit and do it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I felt I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">What they did, I will say that my father was very known person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He has written the history of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">That book is still taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the same book, at the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So he lost, of course, his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He was ill anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">That was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">It was a thing where the Gestapo could let go and say, "Let's see what they're doing." </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So, he was, I would say, ignored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And that was our luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">But, it was very, very difficult for me to give in and to raise my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">How it was resolved that I was sit in the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> in my class and they simply ignored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">They just let me go, let me do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">QUESTION:  And when you went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , did you have friends outside of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">ANSWER:  It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">We had, of course, a few friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We would always have a few friends who thought the same way like we. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And this friendship got even deeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But the separation between the others got altered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">From that time, I really felt my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was my <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">The effect was my father was very ill by that time already with Parkinson's. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">That was the only saving grace because as known as he was, originally they wanted to arrest him as one of the people that instigated of the liberal movement, of the democratic party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But they left him alone because to begin they tread lightly with the known persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">To begin with, because they wanted first to get really in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">So, they let him very soon, I must say thank <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , he died, because that was the only saving grace for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">My mother was a very known liberal person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">She was at this point, of course, only concerned about how far she could bring this family through to those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">We really tried as best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">How did we do it financially? </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Because there was no money left and my father was not anymore 1n the situation he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">So, we started now to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">All the years when we studied at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , every day for hours and hours, we all had students.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  Everybody; your mother included.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  My mother, my brother, we all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I called it my tuition. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1045">laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Because it was the only way how we could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">I was at that time, I barely had passed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> myself, so I was not much of anything yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I had to start to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">But I had all these children who didn't do so well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I taught arithmetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I was not very good myself but I learned arithmetic with them, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Every day I taught them, you see, and that way we could take the money to study at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , because it was very expensive to study at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Only those who join the party, and they, of course, got all the advantages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">We didn't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And so we had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">We had either to pay and then to get the money or else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And, so, for years and years, I just tutored, and we all tutored.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  Now your mother also was helping Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Yes, that was the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">We had quite a few Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Very soon, of course, it came that these Jewish people were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And so we tried, and I will say mainly my mother because I was still a very young person, but we tried to help as much as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">We had quite a few Jewish friends and we tried to help them as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">For example, my mother, as my father, had very good connections to <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , to people from <span class="NPIP">abroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And so, many times she went to them to the <span class="BUILDING">English Embassy</span> and asked for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And little by little, they knew my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">They knew of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">He had a very good reputation all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he was a scholar, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And so, we could help to get these passports for Jewish people to get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">That was where my mother was very, very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">QUESTION:  Did she do it for people she knew or as well for an underground group so that it was... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">ANSWER:  For people she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And, you know, it always starts small. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And they brought other people, and they brought other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">That gets bigger and bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">It's amazing when you get involved in the work, how one comes to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">These things develop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">So, for example, I studied then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I was not finished for my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and what study would I have to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">My three brothers studied medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">We all had government assistance before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">But, of course, now where we had not joined the Party, everything was and we had to do it ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">So, what my mother did, what we all did, we tutored children who did not do good at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for hours and hours every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Sometimes I had the feeling our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span> with many birds in it, you know, as we tutored them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">It worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">It was years of very hard work, but it was the only way we could afford the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">QUESTION:  Tutored Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Jewish children by that time, they were probably dead already, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">No, they were not there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Children simply. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">QUESTION:  You're talking about after '39?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">ANSWER:  Yeah, after '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But also, I mean, after '33, you didn't have many Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I mean, very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I mean, everybody who had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Because '39, I don't think there were many Jews left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">I mean they were simply arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">The Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I don't talk any more of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">They were very soon that started after '33. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I cannot really give you the dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">It was too long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">But, they were simply arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">QUESTION:  Do you remember seeing Jews arrested?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">ANSWER:  But our Jewish friends, you see, we had... . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">that was a different story because my mother, and again my father, we had very good connections to the <span class="BUILDING">English Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And so, I remember all the days when my mother was ready for days and days trying to go from one <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> to the other to try to help them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">That we were very successful in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I shouldn't say we. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">It was my mother and my father, as much as he was still . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">he was very ill later on, but he always was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So, that was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">We helped quite a few of our Jewish friends out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But, you see, all that was so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I mean, I think it started then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Was it '39? </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">When was the big arrest in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Correct me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I think much earlier already, wasn't it, that the Jewish people were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And, of course, it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  Do you remember Kristalnacht(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  Absolutely I remember that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">See, certain things you never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I remember it to that point that I very often dream of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">This is very bad, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">You never quite shake the things you have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">They will stay with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1135">QUESTION:  What do you remember about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1136">ANSWER:  I remember the mob, the screaming people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">People I had known as neighbors who suddenly were screaming and raiding <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">You could do anything that you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Anything, just kicked in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">The Jewish people were arrested, of course, as much as they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">My mother was very instrumental of getting Jewish people passports, passbook, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Whatever worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">She did wonderful things at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And she was away sometimes for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">When she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we would ask her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">She would say, "Please don't ask me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Because the less we knew, the better for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And the less again she knew of my work later on, the better for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">So, we never talked much with each other because bear in mind the Gestapo had methods which aren't known here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Methods of torture where not anybody could have... I mean, it was simply humanly impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">So, more or less, they could find out everything they wanted once they had you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So the best thing was really not knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And those dreaded years where we all got very silent, because silence was the best thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I knew my mother was often away for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I did not ask any question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Then little by little when all the arrests came and the war came, then when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , I had already my exams at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Then I was asked to take totally control over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">That was one of the highlights of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I thought, "My God, here is a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I can really do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">But, again, it also meant that I had to become very silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Because under torture nobody was holding up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So, it meant that more or less I had to remove myself from my friends, from my mother as much as I could, so nobody knew what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  So you had... clearly, you would not be able to be intimate with anybody about what you...
ANSWER:  Under torture, you can get everything out, everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I learned that from experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">There is nothing so the main thing was silence, and doing what you felt yourself was necessary, but not involving anybody else because I felt really what I did myself I had to respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I would have to be punished myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">But to involve anybody else was extremely dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And also the more other people knew, the more danger for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Believe me, this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you see, it's very hard for you to envision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Under torture, nobody holds up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Once you are tortured, there is nothing which can hold up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I knew if I would be discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I didn't even know what my mother was doing, because I knew she did a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I didn't even want to know it, because not knowing meant really gracious that you couldn't even invent anything because you wouldn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">You have never had the system in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">How fortunate you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">It's very hard for you to envision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But under the pressure of the Gestapo, nobody could hold up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  Were you ever questioned by the Gestapo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I was several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I think two or three times I was summoned by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">The interesting thing was we had two systems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">The one that was the, the legal system, which was the old <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and the system you have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And I was hired by the legal system to supervise all activities of the political Scandinavian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">But on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was the Gestapo who knew no law and no order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And they, of course, could do with you what you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">So here was the interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I was appointed by the Minister of Justice of the old legal order to take over the total supervision in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">But, on the other hand, I had the Gestapo who were looking for that woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Why would she have sucha... waiting for that moment where they could tug(ph) me and clearly give me what was due me according to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">That was a very interesting relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">It's very hard for you people to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So I walked a very thin <span class="DLF">path</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I had all my credentials there from the highest Minister of Justice from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Whenever the Gestapo started to answer, I showed this and said, "Look here, you have to answer these people." </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And that was this little double game I led that's really practically saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">That gave me that authority because the interesting thing was again in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> there were also very sharp laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And I knew these people were practically my prisoners but practically starving to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So I said we have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And I put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> heavy with bread, with medication, mainly vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I mean, things which we either concentrated which could keep them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">They did not dare to open my luggage because I again was a very high authority appointed by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">You see, it's funny how for people here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">It's worked very much by authority and since I had been appointed by high authority, they did not dare examine what I was taking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Why I was doing these things because they were afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">This other world(ph), such a system as we had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the Nazi system, which is a system which other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> could have too, which is always a potential. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It works on the fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">The one fears the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And he who can instill the most fear will have the upper top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So my whole policy in dealing with the authorities was to have continuously referred to my connections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And the connections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> had certain for them like Hitler, didn't quite know what they should make of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">There was another thing they couldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">They couldn't understand that I was a academic, that I had all the essential examinations for that particular examination exactly understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">But why oh why would they appoint a woman? </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And I was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">That was very hard to understand, especially for these high Nazi officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And so, little by little, a saga developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Somehow she must have very high connections to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="1222">laughter) And since I very often said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> doesn't like this. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1223">laughter) I had to play my game because not only did I have to save my beloved prisoners but also my own life, the life of my siblings at stake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">If I had really been found out, it would have been tragic, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1225">QUESTION:  Were you frightened throughout this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1226">ANSWER:  Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Don't think that I... The greatest insult I still had when my Scandinavian people tried to stop and tell me I was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I said, "Please don't say that I'm a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">I was ever afraid of the next . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">there's nothing, no hero in me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">But I felt I had to go my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">That is what I had decided even to the point of this: I would have been killed or hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I think I had to go my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">When you're very young, I think you can make that kind of decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And I must tell you, if such a situation would arise again today, I think I would be able to act the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Thank heaven it has never . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">that was one of the reasons I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I needed, after all this was over and I had survived, I needed to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">You see, when everything was over, <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> was so good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">You have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">They treated me, I mean I can almost start to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">There never was anybody treated better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">They came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">The very first moment they came, they sent food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">They then finally invited me to <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I could study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I could finish my medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">There was not a thing they didn't do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And I will never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">The gratitude was overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">But still when all 1s said and done and I had passed my examinations, the one thing that had never left me — my memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">This what was so totally destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Because I loved <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">I loved my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> just as you love your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And I haven't seen it for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">This total destruction of all I had loved, of the spirit of good, of all these things which was for me <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Somehow I had to try to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I felt <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> was too close to it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So after the war I had my examinations there, I studied medicine there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">They were extremely good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And they said, "Now you will stay with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Instead, I think, I have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I have to go where I can forget what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">First, they couldn't quite understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">But they said, "You have to ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But they forgave me and they finally said, "If that's what you must do, we will bless you and we will wish you our good wishes." </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And I can assure you even today after so many years, if somebody comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , they will always come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">They will not only come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , they come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And that maybe has been even a greater reward for me than all the wonderful kinds of decorations they after bestowed on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">This gratitude, this remembrance, this love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">That will forever be in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">I'm very grateful for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">QUESTION:  Tell me about -- you and your mother were baking loaves for bread and you were taking them into the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">That was what I did because it's hard for you to imagine because even in this prison system here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it certainly is not very comfortable because I have been visiting <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">But certainly they get fed and, I mean, it's absolutely according to schedule and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">But there, it was really was so very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">starved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">I mean, they got rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">It's hard for you to imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">Of course, don't forget you only hear about the people who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">You know, of course, of the2,000,000 of people who died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And not only Jewish people, but many, many of our political prisoners from wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Simply overstaffed finally, but there was a certain order in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">It was a minimum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">A minimum of rationing, but it was so that they just could get by if they were strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">So the young ones survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">The older ones it was more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And so what I felt I had to do when I was appointed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to this special situation, to supervise the visits my Scandinavian political prisoners got, I felt not only do I have to supervise there my way, that's not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">But I have also to give them help as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And so I had a wonderful idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was afraid of the air raids and that they would lose everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">So, I had two very heavy pieces of luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And each time when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> or into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I filled my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> with bread, with vitamins, with anything possible to give them nourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And I locked them in and that they never ask you to open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">They couldn't because there again was the idea a very high position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I was appointed directly by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">So whenever they even made a little ask what have you there, I showed them my thing and they said, "Well, but all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Why don't you leave it here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">We can keep it here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I said, "Oh no, that goes right with me because if we are bombed, I will have my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">That is the last thing I have." </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And they never dared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And that is never anybody dared to say, "open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Because one <span class="DLF">opening</span> they would have known what was in it, all these things for the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Why did they not dare it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Because I really had a very high position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I was above them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">I came more or less as if you think your controller comes to control what you're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">So, that was really the tremendous blessing I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">So isn't this awful how the one fooled the other? </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">That was the whole game the Gestapo played. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">To some extent, they were afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I was, of course, very much afraid of them. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1315">laughter) But if you knew how to play it, somehow you could really give them help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">What kind of help could I give? </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">You see, these prisoners were... It's very hard for you even to envision that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">They were at an absolute zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">But they mostly needed . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">they needed, of course, nourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">They needed medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Now, it was nice to carry in bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">I tried to carry that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">But that was so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">What they mainly needed were vitamins, I mean, just to give them the most basic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Somehow to keep them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And, see, that's what I had in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">I had two rather heavy pieces of luggage which I had to carry myself because the Norwegian and Danish priests, I could very well understand it, that they could not do this because that was really my risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And so I had to carry them myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And also by carrying them in myself, since I had this rather high position directly appointed by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , anybody who would ever had dared to say, "open your luggage", and there was a good possibility, I would have said, "Look here, you don't know who your talking with." </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And would have uttered a few names off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">The whole system of Nazism, which I think you have found out and understood, 1s that the one feared the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And if you worked on the fear, based on the fear the other had for you, then you somehow could get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">At least you took a very good chance to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">That was really my whole work, and somehow I could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">You see, what took place already, very much the prison systems all used different . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">different <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">You see, I went from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">How in the world could a woman get such a high job? </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Because I was only a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">In Nazi Germany, the woman was really just there to give children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">That already somehow made them a little bit suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">There must be something special with her if she would get this permission from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">So, that was already a very good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And so they tried to stay as much as possible out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And at least if they would have said, "open your luggage", which they usually would have done, I would immediately said, "Do you realize who I am?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">That would have been the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So, the whole system of Nazi, which I think is hard; it's very difficult to understand here is that the one intimidates the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">It was a system of intimidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">That is what I had to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">It worked very much with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Because the good thing was I was a woman and they always felt if a woman really would get... that's such a hard thing, then she must be something special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">You see, it is a system that the one is fearful of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">Because I was just afraid of them, of course. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1355">laughter)
QUESTION:  Dr. Zassenhaus, when you first had the job censoring letters, they gave you letters from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , isn't that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1357">QUESTION:  Were those the first letters that you were. . .?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">ANSWER:  Those were some of the very first letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">You see, I was in the censored system because due to by my language ability. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">You see, I had also studied English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">It was very by circumstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">It's all about education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Scandinavian language, English language, French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">So, they could use me for all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">That was how it all started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1366">QUESTION:  But was this a shock to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Had you known about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I knew that because, see, we had for years and years every night we listened to the English . </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">We knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Oh, yes, we were totally aware of whatever the English people knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">The BBC we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Because night by night we heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Yes, we were fully aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1375">QUESTION:  These letters were not on regular pieces of paper, I gather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">These were on tissues of .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1377">ANSWER:  They're tissue! </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Toilet tissue! </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">All kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Whatever they could get on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And they sent food, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Send food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I mean, of course, I was there in order to throw it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">So what I did -- Yes, of course, I put the tissue out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">But, see, they had also form letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">They had the form letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And the form letters, they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">That was "Dear mother and father, I am doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">They give me a wonderful time, plenty enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Don't you worry." </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And then there I put in "send food".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1392">QUESTION:  So you wrote it in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1393">ANSWER:  I wrote this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">I tried to get my handwriting . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">yes, I wrote that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">That was the only way. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1397">Send food". </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">See, that was the risk I took. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">It was a risk which I simply ignored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">My parents, my mother, who was very unhappy about it, said "Why do you do that, because you give them little evidence." </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">If that letter was found, of course, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">But there again I based it on the stupidity on the(laughter) again on the prison authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Because, see, I was the final and the highest authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">I was the final authority to send out these letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">And so they, of course, were very afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">That's Nazi system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">To understand the Nazi system, you have to realize that the one is afraid of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">It's just a thing how far can you play it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And the mere fact that I was a woman made the Gestapo think she must be of the highest order, otherwise she would never have gotten this job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1410">QUESTION:  Now one day there were no more letters from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1411">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1520">QUESTION:  Where did get the poison from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">ANSWER:  I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">I think from this captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">You see, poison was easier to get because, as you may know, many of Jewish people, lots of our Jewish friends, simply poisoned themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">It came in a little capsule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">Stric (ph), stric (ph) -- how do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">I don't know what you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">Something which would kill you instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">Many of these Jewish people did do it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">And, so, I had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">It was good for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">It gave me a sense of liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">That if it comes to the worse, I can do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And my parents knew about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">I was totally open to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">They totally agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">Becasue to submit to torture -- that's also one of the wrong ideas in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">They say, "Oh, some people got tortured and they hold up." </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Under torture, nobody holds up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">If you ever come to that, it's lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And so I felt I knew too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">I had no other way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">I would have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">So whenever, and it was not often, I think twice, I came under these intensive feelings from the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">There was intensive -- that hours and hours and hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">It's simply a thing to wear you down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">You won't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">I had a great sense of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Because I had it right in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">It was just one movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">Before that, jump at me and I would have been dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">It was stric (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">I don't know how you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">But something which you can end it immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">And, no, it did not make me unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">It gave me a sense of I was in control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">This is very hard for you to understand nowadays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">And now I'm an old woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">You might ask me would I do it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">Yes and yes and again, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">I would do it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">I'm very grateful that I could get away from it from all these memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">Have I forgotten it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">There are certain moments in your life you will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">Maybe that is the punishment God gives me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I don't know how you're going to...
