QUESTION:  Could you please give their names and --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My father’s name is Joseph Valman, April 19, 1913. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My mother is Fanny Fooks and she was born August 28, 1910. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> after they finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they were looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to practice medicine because both of them were poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They chose a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">When they arrived there, it was 1935 and there was something in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They felt that it was not very safe to announce they were Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Can you explain, did they tell you what the ‘something in the <span class="DLF">air</span> ’, what it was ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  No, I think they were ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Well, my mother especially had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shetow</span> during the revolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Her parents were wealthy merchants and when the revolution, they had to run abandoning property, several property in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shetow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Just run with my grandmother’s jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I think she felt from that time a lot of fear and was extremely suspicious of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I assume that when she started hearing about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that she started to fear that 1t might spread and kept being Jewish a secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">She was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">To her I think, being Jewish didn’t mean very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I have no idea what my father thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But I know that they did not have any record that we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">When I was born in °37, the priest, I think they told the priest -- he gave us a full certificate of baptism. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> from the time I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">From the age of five or so until at least ---, throughout the whole war and maybe after. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I don’t think they ever really thought about being Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  So you didn’t know when you were growing up that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">No, I was going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I don’t -- even I -- I think I may have known we were Jews because I suspect my parents talked about it around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Because -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I suspect I may have had some notion but I don’t know that it meant very much to me, what being a Jew is except it’s dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But that -- yeah, I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> and that was my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That’s what the God I believed in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">That’s how I grew up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  But were your parents churchgoers also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  No, they never went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was not terribly unusual for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  So you were two in 1939 and you were three in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">You don’t have any memories of being -- German ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Oh yes, because the Germans lived with us in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We were occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I have a memo here of singing Oh Tannenbaum to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The first thing they did when they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- we lived in a sort of -- we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , big ,made of brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was attached to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , similar, to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So we were -- we had those two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> touching each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the left, lived an old lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I think after a while, the Germans took her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and made her go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I don’t know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I remember she had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> with flowers and we had a <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> , not much flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">She had all flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So that I was close to the Germans, of course, because they were in the same <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I mean we shared the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was no <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I remember my mother telling me not to eat the candies they gave me because they might be poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Of course, to me it didn’t make much sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I guess, none of it made very much sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I don’t remember being afraid especially of the Germans -- I remember the uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Eventually, they also took our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They threw us out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and made us --. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So we moved in with an old -- with a widow who had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We spent, I don’t know how long -- but until the war was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Do you remember being thrown out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Nor do I remember coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I have memories of not having -- we had enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Nobody ever lacked food because we were a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and there were cows, there were chickens, there was everything you’d need for basics. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But we didn’t have wool, we didn’t have shoes and I remember one time an American soldier in a parachute fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He was caught in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">People in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> got the parachute and I think I saw it because I remember blood on the white silk. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">My mother gathered the thread and she had someone knit me a sweater and it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I hated that sweater with a vengeance. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I remember one day somebody brought us oranges. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I don’t know where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I had never seen an orange before and sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Also I remember when the Americans came to liberate us, we -- they threw us chewing gum to the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They chewed the same piece, I think, for weeks because it was a novelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  All the Germans had left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  No, the Germans were made prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  On the spot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Yes, there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the Germans were in the middle and they threw their arms up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and threw their weapons down. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My father picked a great big revolver which he still has from that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Do you know the date that you were liberated by the Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  I don’t remember now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  When did you find out that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  That’s a big problem for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I do not have very many memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I cannot -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The one thing I remember, I assume my parents told me something, what I remember is being after the war we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was more than eleven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I remember the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> where my parents took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My father, especially, had me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I had to go, I didn’t have any choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I very much hated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  You hated it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  You’re eleven, so that would be about 1948?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  "48, °49.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  You said your parents moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in ’49?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">No, I moved in ’47, they followed a year later in 48. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And then they joined a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and led a more Jewish life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  You observed Sabbath and --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They just went to the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I think for the holidays or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They were not observant at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  You didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But we observed the holidays and we fasted on Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Mostly Yom Kippur, it seems like and the Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Those are the two holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  So there was never any sudden revelation to you after the war that you were Jewish ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  You know something must have happened but I cannot remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  You don’t know why they left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Ostensibly, it was because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> had only one small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where all the children were together from the age of seven to the age of fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Of course my education in there was not excellent and my mother was worried that I couldn’t stay there if I wanted -- if I was going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But this is not the true reason because I could have gone to which was close and spent a week there and come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The real reason was that my mother really disliked the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She felt lost in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She came -- she didn’t like the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">She didn’t like to practice medicine and --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Why didn’t she like the people? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Just because their background was so different from her own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She felt they were peasants and she had nothing in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My father, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , very much liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Liked it there, liked to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He was one of these old fashioned doctors who go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He went around by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> at first, then on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , then in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He taught me how to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">When I was seven years old, he let me use the wheel. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He liked it there but he moved pretty much against his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  So your father was driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Yeah, we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Even in the beginning of the -- there might be a picture of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was a big Maitron. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was called a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I remember vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was gray and it had the black on the side of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It had the black stepping place you know with rubber with <span class="DLF">lines</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  And he could take that on his rounds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">My mother took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> when we left, just before the Germans came, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">People were just leaving, running away from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So she went down south towards <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> , towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Then there were a lot of bombings apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don’t recall much about it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But my first memory is being under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with my grandmother holding on to my sleeve. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I wanted to run out and she was hanging on to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  That was in <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">That was during the evacuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Oh, so your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was evacuated when the German army first came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  I don’t think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I think some people left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Who could get away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Okay, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  But it was a large Russian colony. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Then the -- I think my grandmother opened a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They survived as well as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But then, I think, the Japanese, you know there was trouble with the Japanese at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So my mother told them to come to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , asked them to come and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So they arrived just before I was born.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of them as being mean or kind or ----?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  I remember playing with them, playing with some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I have a feeling that they sort of -- were more or less I guess like the rest of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We didn’t have SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I think we had young men who might have been just as unhappy to be in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as we were unhappy to have them there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Oh, everybody hated the Boche, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I think compared to the stories I hear of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> where literally you saw people shot in the <span class="DLF">street</span> or treated very inhumanely, I think we hated the Boche because they were there, because they were the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But I don’t think there were any incidents in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  No one died during the war ?</span></p>
