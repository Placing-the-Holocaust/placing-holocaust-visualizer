class="BUILDING">ammunitions factory</span> and the day before we were liberated, the day when we were liberated, to me it seems to be the 15“ of January, ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">The end of ’44 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We had there a German boss which it didn’t bother him. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">He said you don’t bother me, I don’t bother you. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He was foolish, but it didn’t bother him any, didn’t do anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Then they took him away and came in another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">He was crazy, foolish. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">You couldn’t talk to him anything, couldn’t talk to him, there was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So the boys said let’s try to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the machine, sometimes a shell we would find on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , or whatever it was he hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He passed by, because he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">One time I passed by she said was it night? </span><span class="sentence" id="624">She was crying, I said what’s the matter she said I don’t know, everything was going perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He hit me with a screwdriver. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you’re trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Which it meant if we won’t be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">As weak as I was I said no, not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I don’t buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I find in between two machines, he was a short fellow, he wasn’t taller than me and I went over to him and I yelled at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I said why did you hit my wife for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">If you going to hit my wife for nothing, hit me, I’ll be able to take a beating, but don’t hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And he started beating me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don’t hit my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It’s unbelievable because he didn’t have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But apparently, he didn’t do it and since then he didn’t touch her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">This was before Christmas time ’44, about three, four weeks before. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Then the 15" of January in the morning, they didn’t took us out from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We remained in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Like normally, we used to go out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from the shift from the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">At that time it looked, it didn’t look good. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">At one time before, like I said I had my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I never used to write the letters to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But when the letters used to come she used to live at 633 North 5", <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , Pa., <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">At one time it just him me, came into my mind the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I used to say it in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I took the address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">When it looked so bad, I said to my wife, you see, here I give you my sister’s address. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">If we’ll survive there we’re going to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">This happened the 15" of January, the 15". </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So in the morning we didn’t go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Later on around 9 o’clock or so, 10 o’clock, we had to go out to the appel and stand up in the <span class="DLF">line</span> and the bosses came around to take us to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">We had one boss which he was fairly a decent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Unfortunately one time he took, he killed, shoot a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Whether he was drunk, it was a little instigation from somebody else and he passed by our group and told us in German, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he is talking to us, to take with you clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">To take in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Like he knew something, something is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So we went in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , our group, and while we were in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , I took the coat, whatever my wife had and mine, put in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> wherever we had to do for the machines, and I’m there for a minute or two minutes, a boy comes in and says, Moishe go out take a look where your wife is. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I went out I see her come in from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">The boss who had the shift before, so he want to keep his women, he want to keep, and send away the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So she went over to him, it was the 15" of January, it was cold, she said I want go take mine coat from my husband and I will be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He said go, but come right back. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So naturally I went over to that boss, he knew me, not the one who hit my wife before, but the other one, higher than him, and I told him my wife they’re going to take out, do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He said I’m powerless, there’s nothing I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">There was, the main engineer from the whole <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> there, the <span class="BUILDING">ammunitions factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So the main engineer from the whole <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , in normal times, everybody was afraid for his look. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Terrible, terrible man. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">At that moment he stood with a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody whoever came to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Why, it was plain and simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They were trying to take out the people and people were running back. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Nobody wants to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Everybody wants to stay in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they were taking them out and they were running back. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So he was hitting everybody over the head, wherever he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And while he stood with his stick hitting everybody over the head, unbelievable as 1t may sound, how I did it, I don’t know, but I did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I went over to him and I said, engineer, I’m here from the first moment when the <span class="NPIP">place</span> started, now they’re going to send out my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">If they’re going to send her out, I’m going to go with. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I scared him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So he said, where is the boss? </span><span class="sentence" id="680">He called over the boss, not the one who hit her, but the other one who hit her from time to time, but he gave her a piece of bread too. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He said do you know her?. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Is she a good worker, he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He said remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Another boy did the same thing for a girl and she also remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">How I did it, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But it was a rumor just imagination 1t was, supposedly you’re supposed to say they should have left his father that the boy should remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So somehow I did it and that’s how we remained together. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Later on I gave her the address from my sister and said, because it looked like something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So I said if we’ll survive, there is going to be a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">O.K. Then we are still in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to bring in the lunch for the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Then we got a lunch and I sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> near the machine, while I was sitting eating we heard some banging, to bang a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So I didn’t pay too much attention after awhile another repeat, didn’t pay attention yet, but then it didn’t took long another few minutes we heard more banging. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So I said that time to my wife, because she was sitting with me near the machine, I said now I’|l put away the food what I had, let’s pay attention what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So after awhile we saw the Germans through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , we could see that they start running. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what’s going on with you don’t you see what’s doing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> already? </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Stop the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">There was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> , a bigger one than ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">When the Russians came close to that they evacuated the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and it took about six months till the Russians came in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So they were told, the rumors were going on, the Germans said they were supposed to leave the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> should be able to go till the last minute, cause it was a bigger <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> than ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">This apparently what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">In our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in our situation the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was running until the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But still we were afraid that they’ Il tear off the bounty () place with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">This was the thought what it may happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">This is what they did in some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So we were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and around it starts to get dark already, one of the Germans came in with a sack of bread giving out bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So whoever could reach it got bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Then the commander from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> start to go around and calling the people said to go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He said I was for you like a father, come with me, the Russians are coming, come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And unfortunately, a couple hundred people went up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  With him?</span></p>
