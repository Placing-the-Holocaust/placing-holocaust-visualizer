<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My father owned a <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> in an adjacent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of where I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  How would you describe your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Was it middle class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, in those days was considered middle class because we -- my father was in business and he employed some of the inhabitants of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Was your family a very religious family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father was not very religious but we attend services in the next small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was born and where we lived later, 1t was composed only of two other Jewish family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  So both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were not primarily Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  No, they were not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  How large was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you first lived in, approximately?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Or how old you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  From the time when I was born, apparently -- I do not remember when we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Apparently, I was very young --
QUESTION:  You were still young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  -- because my brother, who was born two years later, was born already in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Did you live -- what was the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you were --
ANSWER:  (sounds like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parcheetza</span> ).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  And is that in the same general <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  That is the same general location. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It's only like three kilometers away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  And you had said that there were also only two other families that were Jewish in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And did you grow up right in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I grew up in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and when -- and I attended <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And at age of 11 or ten, my father hired a tutor who taught us the -- prepared for the bar mitzvah, me and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we had this man -- or different men living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So he was tutoring me, my brother, and later my sisters in religious observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Let's talk about your experiences with non-Jews when you were a young child because you must have had many of them because there were only two other families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Well, in my case, I have to say that the neighbors treated us quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We did not experience like in other <span class="REGION">area</span> because my father employed quite a large number of the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So they had to be quite decent with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">As a matter of fact, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with one of the fellows, who later, I feel that he saved my life because he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> much earlier than me and he had, by the time I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he was a (sounds like schrieber) on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That's a quite high position. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And he helped me quite a lot with the food and protect me from the atrocities which were occurring in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We'll talk about that a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">When you were young, what about your playmates generally? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Did you experience any antisemitism among your playmates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Because, as I explained previously, those people were depending on the livelihood from my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  And the teachers --
ANSWER:  The teachers --
QUESTION:  -- did not give you any problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  The teachers never gave me any problem, because, as -- it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And those teachers used to be involved with my mother because she was more intelligent than the normal villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So they came and sometimes socialized together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Were you in any youth groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Did you do any sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Not organized sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I played soccer, which was very popular in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but nothing organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">When did you first notice a change? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">What is the first thing that became apparent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Well, in 1939, when the Germans start to occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , some of the inhabitants became Volksdeutsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That means that they were claiming that their ancestor were from German descent. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And they got some positions of importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then there were like -- they felt they're much, they are much better and that -- but actually they did not -- maybe there was overt antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Did not, I didn't feel any repercussion from them except they did not socialize or have anything to do with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  You were 16 years old when the war began in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Do you remember that actual moment when they came to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Oh, I do remember this because we -- my father felt, the day the war broke, that was September Ist, 19 --
QUESTION:  '39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  --'39, that we were not very secure 1n this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So we packed our belongings on a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> -- actually, we didn't have no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> -- and went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to be between Jews, where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stary Sacz</span> (please check). </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I would say it was at least 100 to 150 Jewish family live in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"> Stary Sacz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And then you stayed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  We were there for about two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And there was some incident at this first encounter with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They order all Jews to assemble on the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And they selected, I don't remember exactly, ten or 15 of the people, ordering them, and they shot them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Then --
QUESTION:  This is something you witnessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes, I witnessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That was my first part, encounter with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And --
QUESTION:  You were 16 years old at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Yes, I was 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  What were your feelings, then, when you saw that as a young man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Well, my feeling was that, here I am, witnesses finally what I had for few years, what the Germans are capable of do to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">After the execution of those people, they also selected a hundred of people and locked them up in a <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My father was between those. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And that was quite big shock to the family because we did not know what will happen with those hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Next morning, though, they were released and after, oh, I don't know, three, four hours, we packed our belongings and went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  And the next experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well, the next experience was just that from time to time we were inducted in the work groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are not paved like we have paved here. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were, like, <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So we were, during the summer and fall, we built the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We chopped the stones that the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are always ready for the transport of their heavy equipment and - the German equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And in winter we shoveled snow because the climate in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was much more severe than we have it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And we were -- the <span class="DLF">roads</span> have to be clear for the army to be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Are we talking about summer and fall of 1940 or --
ANSWER:  We are speaking -- no, of winter of 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  In '40. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And what was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you were in then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  (Parcheetza). </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I lived -- I came back --
QUESTION:  Oh, that was back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Oh, I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So you were building <span class="DLF">roads</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Building <span class="DLF">roads</span> and cleaning <span class="DLF">roads</span> of the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Of course we, as I previously said, there were only two other Jewish family so the workforce consisted of much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They brought Jews from adjacent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and they were always ready to, we were ready to work on --
QUESTION:  Were you living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I was living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And those conditions were to about 1941, when the (sounds like youthenlaut) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stary Sacz</span> was ordered to select about 100 young people from (sounds like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermitz</span> ) and to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> , R-A-P-K-
ANSWER:  The time when we were told that we will go to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we did not know what the function of our work will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  What part of 1941 was this, approximately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  May.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  In May. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And you were one of these hundred people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Yes, I was one of those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Are these all men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  All men. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We arrived there sometimes in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Were you the only member of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  I was the only member of my family because -- well, maybe that's the best time to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My father was chosen by the man who was the (sounds like guylighter) for this <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> as a necessary operator of this -- the German needed the lumber and the wheat, which -- so my father with my younger brother were working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So that's why they were not selected for any ordered transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But I went with this hundred people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  How far away was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Oh, 40 kilometers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  How did you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  On atrain. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We got tickets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  So it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Passenger, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Were you very frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No, I was not frightened because we did not know exactly what -- we thought that in this part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they need young men for the same purpose as we were working previously because it was quite natural that they selected from one <span class="NPIP">part</span> people to go to another <span class="NPIP">part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We were on their mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They -- So when we arrived there on Monday morning, we found that this was an <span class="BUILDING">SS school</span> to train young volunteer Ukraines to become SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The commandant of this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , by the name of Rosenbaum, greeted us with selecting one tenth of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , ten people, and he shot in front of us the ten young healthy men. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was -- this time it really, we realize that the German mean what they were saying, that they have to destroy the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We lived there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The Jewish community of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> was assigned to provide food and shelter for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And we lived there and went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">That was a very short walk, maybe ten minutes' walk, every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We walked there in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We built a <span class="DLF">shooting gallery</span> , digging in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and preparing the war for -- a <span class="DLF">shooting gallery</span> they built there to train the new recruits how is the most efficient way to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But after about four weeks spending the time there, the adjacent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , were to be liquidated and the people were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And Rosenbaum had a couple actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And then we really knew what were our duty were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We were gravediggers and we bury all people which were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  They had these actions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> in this particular <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> earlier where the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  And you said you were a gravedigger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The other 90, 90 young men, because there were 90 in the beginning, but later on, seven of us, of the group escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And to punish the remain of us, he took 21 and hang. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So there were only left about 65 or maybe 70. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Life there was, I find that the first came in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> gave much deeper impression on us than the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or were much more people killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but more vivid things I remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> because this commandant spent time. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We have seen him every minute of the day and sometimes if he felt like, he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> woke us up, and direct us running all around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And his specialty, he had a reitpeitsche, that's a whip, and if he didn't like someone, he hit them from the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He cut his eye or -- and by the next action, you were marked that you will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So it was quite hard for a young man to live with this hanging all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  You had said that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was giving you food and shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  So were you living at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , though? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You had said you were --
ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was about ten minutes away from the --
QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  From the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> where we lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  So you didn't live with other Jewish families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was made as a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> only we had guards on the <span class="DLF">gate</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It was three small <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You slept in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  No, no, we slept in the -- originally there were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish buildings</span> , maybe two family in each. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So there were, let's say, eight <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in each <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So put 24 people in each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , slept on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But that was a small, very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> consisting of 70, 65 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  And what about the food situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  The food situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> had to provide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">There was somebody who cooked and when we came -- in the morning we got a ration of bread and a coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And in the evening when we came back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , we got a soup.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  And what were you wearing? </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Your own clothes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  We wear our own clothes, which we brought from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Every four weeks or so, we got a pass to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , ten each. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Each week on a Saturday he permit us to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , ten of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Then we waited for our turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And Sunday afternoon we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It was a short ride on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from time -- from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Did you have to wear any identifying signs showing you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  We -- the clothes were only painted yellow stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">In the beginning, it was not -- oh, yeah, we had the, every Jew had to wear the Mogen David on the white with the blue thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But otherwise, in the beginning, it was not required in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> , to be any way else identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Well, this lasted for about two months or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And we heard that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stary Sacz</span> , because eventually my parents were also moved from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we lived to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stary Sacz</span> , that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> going to be liquidated and everybody going to go -- be sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So on this particular week, we all got the permit from Rosenbaum to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to say goodbye to our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I don't really know if our parents knew exactly the condition because we did not share every brutality as what happened to us and what we have seen to the parents, at least I will speak for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I felt that there's no point to burden the parents what is going on with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They had enough problems of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So I did not share too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I went with general ideas, what's going on, that -- but I did not inform them. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They knew that they killed ten of us because ten never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But what we were doing, that we were gravediggers and we buried people, I did not share this with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But there was a general feeling that more or less they knew that they will go to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And Sunday, when we had to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my father took the group, because we still had a couple horses, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was not a long ride but it was much better to give us a ride than we should walk because there was no other way to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So he came there to say goodbye to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I said goodbye to him already and went back almost to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And in the last minute, I decide to go back and I jumped over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , because by the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , to say another goodbye to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And the SS guard saw me and started beating me. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And it's not the pain of my -- what hurt me but the feeling of my father, who was helpless, that he could not help anything to his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">That was more painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But eventually we got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And a few weeks later we found out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stary Sacz</span> was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We knew very well what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="237"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where people went to be killed, gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Meanwhile, those actions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> continue in much bigger pace than originally because apparently they felt that this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> has to (youthenlate) -- euthanized (please check) and they will have to kill more. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So then it was almost every day that he created an action. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Rosenbaum, when the <span class="DLF">graves</span> were ready, dug, we dug almost from the morning into like 4:00, then he inspected all those, if they're large enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Then we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We had some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And we were ordered in the evening to come back and watch the actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He grouped the people by the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They had to be disrobed, put the clothes on the side, and stay by the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">He generally gave the SS men some whiskey and -- oop, sorry -- gave an order to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Take this away? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">After the <span class="DLF">graves</span> were filled, we had to throw the dirt with some disinfectant. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And next morning we cut the -- make like sod from further away and brought cover, that there was no, any evidence that there were <span class="DLF">graves</span> there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Men and women together and children that were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">On one action he killed a family which lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> by the name of Rosenbaum. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He found out that the people beared the same name as him. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Then he was -- he felt that it was -- the son had his name so he tried to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Of course --

<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  Did you go with a whole group of young men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Part -- half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But I would like to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenbaum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">In 1968, he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and he told the German authority that he's back from the war, he was in the Wehrmacht, that's the army, and he likes to get a pension from the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">When I arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I register for Wiedergutmachung to the -- from German and I got all the -- I gave this organization all the information, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> I spent and what the name of the commandant were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So they contacted the German -- the German authority contacted, apparently, the Jewish organization and they got my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And they send me, first, the prosecutor from the trial sent me a telegram if I am willing to come and first recognize -- they show me pictures of him and I recognize him, if I am willing to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to testify to his trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">In the beginning, I was quite hesitant because it was only '68. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I started -- I was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I had two young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And to renew the wounds was quite hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But after discussion with my wife, we decide that it's my duty, because there was really, there were only three left from the whole group who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> who could testify as witnesses to his atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and testified. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I had my wife and my two children, then I had only two, right now I have three children, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I, I testified for, I think, three days there to his trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And, I don't know, I had a feeling when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with him that he was a big statue, big, heavy-built man. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">After I met him on the witness stand, he was just a normal, small -- so apparently his authority of life and death, which he had make in our mind, the statue so big. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And he got convicted and he got life in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I didn't follow this up, if he's still alive or he's out of his -- but at least that was a satisfaction, that, after all, he killed enough Jews but he did not kill everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">There were some who could witness his -- and give witness to the future generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And he was punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Of course I don't feel that the punishment was -- met the crime but here at least he was punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And then I -- with the Germans, the young people, I have to say that at this time when we were there, we were treated quite nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And the Germans had, at the time when we were there, some also guilt feeling because they, I presume they had to ask the fathers where were your grandfathers at this particular time, what did you do during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So there was some, I don't know, maybe I'm not -- I had some sympathy with them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  We were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> because apparently the authorities there, knowing that we already experience for months how to build the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> for -- because first we had to build a couple <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for the SS there. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So they decided they're going to build a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">For about two or three weeks, we walked every day, a group of us, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and then there was another detachment from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> to prepare for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because that's where -- their way to build the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They had -- apparently, they wanted to eventually evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow ghetto</span> and the people who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> will be sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="309"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , rather, at those days had another commandant than this (sounds like get) who was portrayed in Schindler's List because that is the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as is portrayed in Schindler's List. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Well, those days we knew there are many different industrialists who were renting the Jewish labor from the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , but we did not pay too much attention about Schindler. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We knew he had -- that there were some people who worked in his part. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There were parts in the <span class="BUILDING">pants factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But later on when it was already close to evacuate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and Schindler tried to organize a larger group, we knew that people who, either who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or previously who had some means to get on the list, I never -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> I was quite already, what did you call this then, Muselmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">In other words, I was not very healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I just work. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Because the work was very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I -- By the end, after a year and a half working just with the digging ditches and <span class="BUILDING">building barracks</span> , I was transferred to a <span class="BUILDING">carpenter's factory</span> because a man who was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">carpenter's factory</span> was acquaintance of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And after he found out that I'm there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , he took me in.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Do you remember what you felt like at that point, your thoughts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Well, the condition after that was already three years I went through from one to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You were so conditioned, that whatever will happen, will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You did not dwell too much what you gonna do. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You start to believe in fate already. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">There's nothing much you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">You better don't think too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Just watch yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Not to be too close to somebody who gonna hit you or beat you or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">You just try to be in the background and maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I had a very strong urge then when I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that if there's any chance to survive, after what I went through, I'll have to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And, I don't know -- a good thing, though, that we were there on the quarantine. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Each transport who come, was, I think, the whole week we didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We could not get out from the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We got food like normal, four ounces of black bread, coffee, black coffee, and in the evening you got a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But it was known to the rest of the inmates that the transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So there were some people who were already longer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who were interested always to find maybe their brothers or whoever is family. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So they came and tried to ascertain who -- the names and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So after a while, someone somehow told the friend of mine who I lived and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with that I am here, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So he came visit me and brought me more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And then after the quarantine, in the beginning, he arranged a good work group for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I work far. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We walked every today. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But it was indoors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  What block number were you living in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  18A. And every so often, he came, visit me, and helped me out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  What kind of work were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  I was working in a steam producing -- my duty was they had a big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and that was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinets</span> and they brought pieces of wood and I threw in the -- to create steam. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was very easy work and warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">No elements of cold weather go through and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So if I wouldn't have lived there -- I mean through this period of, I think I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> four, five months, that's where I came to more strength, because when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was liquidated in 19 --
QUESTION:  Liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Before -- the Russians were very close so they wanted to send everyone who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I was almost on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was already middle of December, in winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And they did not, they could not spare any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So we marched for two days and two nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">If I wouldn't have the strength in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I could not survive the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">For two days and two nights we walk through the snow and there were, I would imagine it was maybe one tenth of the marchers survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Everybody else who could not keep up with them going was shot by the guards, who were riding on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  Were you with -- was it just men on your march?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Yes, there was on the particular march was men. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And this particular -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , on the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- I mean on the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , it was only men. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , 1n the central lager, there were only women who were secretaries but they did not live in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Buta very strange thing, what I still cannot have answered to what happened on this march, sometimes during the march, there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English military plane</span> going quite low over our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And the Germans, the guards got panicky and started to run away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And how we were conditioned through this four years, we could not decide for ourselves what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So we followed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">We knew very well that there is no way to escape because we were with this blue and white stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It's winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">You could not disrobe yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And you could not go to a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">But it is just that the conditioning through so many years, you did not function by yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You had to get an order. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We didn't get the order to go away -- go turn right; we followed the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And it is quite puzzling to me how a human being can be conditioned to do things against their will. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So finally --
QUESTION:  How many were in your group? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">How many people were on your march?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  Well, it's very hard for me to determine how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was a long, long <span class="DLF">line</span> of people when we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Only the historian can decide that the march started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and how many people came here and there because it's -- you know, it was quite -- I mean, I don't know if this 1s a nice way to talk about our way but everyone was only concerned about himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">You did not care what's going on there in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You didn't care what's going on on the left <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">You were only hoping that you will survive, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But that was the condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And you had to apparently adjust to the condition, what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And maybe it's, like today, it's not too good to dwell too much what -- how we behaved because, I mean, I don't know -- finally we arrived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in, on some <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they gave us a big <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  Were any of the German soldiers with you or was it just the survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">There were all German -- I mean the guards -- after the, after the --
QUESTION:  You were still with the guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  After the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> left and they came back and we marched again. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So after we -- they give us arest for overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We rest there, slept there in this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and next morning we were loaded on some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And, well, we didn't know where we were going but we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , we were placed on this <span class="DLF">block</span> for young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I mean, at least I was placed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And in 1945, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we were not required to do any work. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Just they brought us there to be stored if they need someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">End of File One Beginning File Two
QUESTION:  You were talking about how you had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> at those times, already 1945, or might be '44, December, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was already in disarray. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There were many people brought there because the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was still more or less secure from the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I was put on the young man's block and this <span class="DLF">block</span> became quite famous by Elie Wiesel's book, "The Night" where he speaks about Gustav, who was the blockalteste. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I lived there and during the day we were not required to go to any work. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It is just that once in a while food got more scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Instead of every day the rations what we were supposed to get, we got every second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But they told us, if you volunteer on any transport to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you might get more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But somehow, I decide that I will stay there, at least I know what's going on here, I don't want to volunteer for any unknown situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So time was very hard to pass, because we did not do anything, and as I said previously, the food got scarce, but we tried to live from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Close by end of March
QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with this Gustav, whom you mentioned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Well, he was my blockalteste. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He was in charge of the <span class="DLF">block</span> and he the Jewry (ph), the book about what Elie Wiesel was not very he but ok
QUESTION:  You described your experiences with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  My experience I felt that the man did the best he could under those circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">You cannot please everybody all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The man tried to do good for the majority. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">If he hurt someone sometimes then I feel because I thought about this quite many years now. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">How we survivors sometimes handle the people who got the jobs of a kapo to be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Not always they did the best in my opinion what in their position required. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The one who criticize, let him put himself sometimes in a position of the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You know _ they were required to do certain things by the German authorities there and they had to do, otherwise they would be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And _ so in April

<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  And your health was ok at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  Considering the situation we didn't have to work the health was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But
QUESTION:  In April you heard bombs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  We heard bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The rumors started going that the army _ the allies are very close and soon they're going to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And we were informed that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> going to be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">For about a week before we were liberated we didn't get any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So you it was early spring, so we ate whatever we could find on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because there were quite grassy molds (ph) there so we took the grass and ate and sometimes we took some water with the grass and cooked look a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">You had to somehow survive because there was _ yes, they tried to induce people to leave and they say that if you are going to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you are going to get more rations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  Who tried to induce you, the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  The German authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Tried to encourage you to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Tried to encourage you to leave, and later we found out that all those people who fell for that, they were taken to next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and were shot there, where they were prepared already for well I mean, I
QUESTION:  But you decided to stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  I decided to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But I still cannot understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They had the power if they wanted to do this, to come and say a thousand of you come with us and we would have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So I mean it is not my personal knowledge that that would have happened, but that's what we were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Anyway, one morning we heard those shots very loud and a few minutes later we had seen the American Army came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="524">In the first group it was a young chaplain, Rabbi Schacter, who when he saw what's going on there, it didn't take him long, he organized a transport of young people who their health was not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Half the first transport when to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">On this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> Elie Wiesel was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> he organized to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> through the world Red Cross and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  When you were in the camp did you know Elie Wiesel, had you met him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  I'm sure I met him, but I didn't know’ we were not formal, we never told the second name. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Maybe I met him as Elie who was sleeping above me, no, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">When I I just have seen him last Sunday, he spoke in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> where my daughter lives, and I spent quite a few minutes with him to talking about different things it's not the first time I talk to him, but you know’ _who knew.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Casually if you sleep next to somebody, I don't know the second name. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It wasn't important, I mean, besides in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that was completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The names didn’t mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">The numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We were called by the numbers and we did not the same thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="545">had my there were numbers printed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">There were numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">The Germans communicate to us by the name if they want by the number, not by the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The names were registered there but the numbers were the important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So if you did not remember your number, you were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">If they called your number and you did not respond immediately, you got punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  Do you remember your number?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was 1740609. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">As a matter of fact, I mean, I don't know how important it is, but it's just curious because now we hear about this _ that these young men gonna get flagging whenI marched to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from my work, one day somebody gave me two eggs because we carried those canteens with soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So I had two eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Eggs were very valuable in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I would have gotten something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So the guard randomly looked, he said, "open it." </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He looked in my <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> and started stirring with his stick and he found the eggs so I was selected on a side. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">My number was taken and I would have gotten 25 lashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But fortunately for me the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liquidated and they didn't have enough time to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So you know it's very hard to condense everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You know, I'm just going with at the moment what comes to my head I find important.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  1947? </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> up to that point?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  The war influenced me very, very negatively. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">My I'm still looking for answers to the questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Where was the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Where was the Jewish community of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where we were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Today we know that was well known in 1942 that what Hitler was doing with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It is known also that when Eichmann came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was the last bastion of Jews, the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> saved about 10,000 Jews for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And they were paid and when they were asked United States government or United States Jewish community were asked to donate more money for some reason, somehow, it was not forthcoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So sure the blame lies directly on those people who helped Hitler or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but the numbness of the world, of the demographic committee in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I still cannot understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> of German refugee came here to this shores and was turned around and sent back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Uh huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  When we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it's only a very short distance where there are Buna workers -- that was industrial area for a military purpose where (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="634">It was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Why they never threw at least one or two bombs at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which were coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with the people who died? </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We were realized the people would have been killed, but they were killed anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would be wrecked for a couple of days or weeks and at least the destruction would not have occurred as occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So Hitler did not hear really any opposition from no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So he continued to do what his goal was. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I get many questions, why the Jew resisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">My answer to them is I resisted for every day, because his aim was to kill me and I am still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So what resistant would it be, I mean I am speaking about my personal thing, would it have been better if I would escaped and hide someplace and be killed later by a Pole and I knew from right from the beginning we were told in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rabka</span> , that you are responsible for your neighbor, for your person who you are living or who you are working, if he escapes you be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I never, never through the whole my living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had any time, notion, of taking a life of somebody else on my conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">There are different types of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I'm just speaking for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And I cannot, and I'm not sorry that I did not know, that I did not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">The next thing what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> after the liberation, the young army soldiers grabbed few of us who were near, and they immediately, after the marching they took the commandant, previous commandant from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Germans, with the guards, and put them there closed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They came to us and said, come with us, we show you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">They took us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> there and showed us SS lying there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and said, “you want a gun, you want a stick, do whatever you want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Yeah, very true, there were many of my inmates there who took their advantage, but I felt, and that bothers me today, sometimes, did I act the right I couldn't make myself to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Because I felt if I would do this to him, I would lower myself to this position of what he did to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And sometimes I'm ashamed to tell this, that I was a coward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  How do you feel about being Jewish, did it change because of your experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It didn't change much. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">As I previously said I was never very religious and I am not today. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">There were questions when I was much younger, where was G d, where this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But I cannot blame this on G d or religion or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I accepted what had happened and I feel that maybe it always of suffering of some something different comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I strongly feel that if the Holocaust did not exist, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would not exist either. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So I feel that maybe the world to do something, that it did not do during the Holocaust, so gave us a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of our own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  How do you feel about getting war reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  Reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Despite what some people feel, I feel whatever they they cannot pay me enough for what I went through and I will get anything they are willing to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  Have you communicated to your children about your experiences in the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  Well, that is also just a few days before I spoke with my son who 1s now 42, he does not want too much to hear to my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He reads. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">He looks for all the information, but he does not listen to me about the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">He never I sometimes volunteer in the beginning, I did not want to speak myself, but later, a few years pass, I decide that I whoever wants to listen I'll speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I speak with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , I speak with <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> , and congregations, I go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But my daughter, yes she Ihave one son who is 42 and one son who 1s 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">The boys, for some reason don’t want it when I start talking about some Holocaust, when we have company they walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So the son told me that he cannot stand to listen what I went through, cause it hurts him, so that's why. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">But the daughter for somehow, I can communicate with her, I can talk to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  Does the war still affect you any way besides for what you already said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  Well, yes it affects me I mean for so many years I would like to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to time where I was born and maybe next year I go because I also going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> because 50 years when I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I feel that I have to complete the circle, the cycle has to be closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I resisted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> just purely that I will spend my good money to give to the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But there 1s something more to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I have to see the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born, how it is, and then put a lilt salt in their face that I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So I'm going with my brother in law and my sister in law. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I asked my younger son to go, he doesn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">He belongs to the Hashomer Hatzair, Jewish organizations which go every year the young children go he never wanted to go, but
