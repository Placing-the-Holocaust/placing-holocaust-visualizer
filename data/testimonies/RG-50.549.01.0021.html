ANSWER:  Well, as | mentioned before, my father was a pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father was from a very poor but religious family, and he was a self-made man who really made himself what he was and was very well looked upon by the members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He was a pharmacist and at this time he suffered already because he was Jewish pharmacist, because in 1933, when everything started to brew in Nazi Germany, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the anti-Semitism grew very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">At this time, he was working in a government very big <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He was told that he cannot work there anymore, that he has to have a different degree, he has to have a Master in Pharmacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So you went and you studied very hard and finally he had this degree in Master of Pharmacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Even when a very anti-Semitic professor was giving him a very harsh time, he went to the exam, answered all the difficult questions, and when he was coming out, the professor said, “By the way Masure(ph), what is the formula for oxygenated water?” </span><span class="sentence" id="18">you know, and he was so full of the complicated formula, then he went blank, and then he had to study again and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and finally he got this Master degree, but it took maybe six months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Then those three Jewish pharmacists that worked in this government big <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> were taken out and were told that Jews cannot work in a government job because it was not fit for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was a very big tragedy for us and my father was very, very unhappy, but, with the help of other members of the family and his friends, he was able to buy a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in 1938 but imagined that, since he was Jew, he had no right to buy it so he had to pay a Polish pharmacist, and | remember his name was Dischemsky(ph), and he bought the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, we were living in Vienna(ph), and my father was commuting and going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But, there was, my mother was a dentist and my parents meet at the University of St. Petersburg when they were student and it took them quite a while till they had the means to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My mother was very beautiful women and that only was a very good professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The best day of the week for us was Friday because this was the date that she wasn't working. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And, | remember the pride that | felt when | was working from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and | never saw my mother without their hat and a pair of gloves; and strange men used to tip their hat and say how beautiful she is, a princess. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So, | was very proud of her, and not only was | very proud of her but my mother was my best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">| could talk to her very open, she was a very alterault(ph) and gentle soul and she did a lot of deeds when | was never told about, but unfortunately she, a women who was beautiful and good, contracted cancer, and May 24, 1939, she passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This was a very big defense(ph) tragedy, a very big tragedy for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And, | remember working on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the sun was shining and | said to myself, “My mother is not here and the world is going on and the birds are singing and the beautiful lilacs are blooming and she’s not here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was a very, very, bad loss for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And, me and my sister were left two little orphans, there were a lot of other women that were very keen to be our mother because my mother was only 40 years old when she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But, my father and my mother always took us to all kinds of concert, children play, operettas; when | was six years old, my father took me to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , my mother asked him to do it, and since then, a new world opened for me because | was . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And, also, a very important part of our life was my nanny because she was taking us, especially me because | was older, (I’m four years older than my sister, Rachel) was taking me to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">When | was going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> , | had to get dressed and | had to wear white gloves and if my nanny decided that my clothes were not proper, she was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , we had an account, she used to order material for the dress, she used to go to the dress maker and then, after awhile, when the bill came to my father, my father used to say this women will ruin me, but she was the only one who’s no afraid of him and she was saying to him, “Do you think this is right, that our two little girls, who look like paupers? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">How, what would the other nannies in the <span class="DLF">park</span> say?” </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So, my father was a patafanilias(ph), you know, very good but stern and his word was, even, was, | mean, he had to just to look at you and we knew what he meant and his word was going . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And my mother, many times, she was also a bread winner but she was intimidated but my nanny stood her ground and she was saying to my mother, “The little girls have to bend to be little ladies” and so | had the very, very, pampered childhood and very good childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">| loved my parents and they really gave me the best that they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  What language do you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  When my parents, when they were young people, they started in the University of St. Petersburg, so they spoke Russian. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="41">Til | was three or four years old, | only spoke Russian and then one day, my father came, and said “We have to speak Polish” because Vienna(ph) was ___, you know, at time, it was like in between, it was Russian, it was Polish, now it is Lithuanian and each <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> brought their language so we had to read, know, a lot of languages, so then | started to speak Polish; and, | was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , only for Jewish children, but we were taught only Polish, but we had lessons in Hebrew and in the religious instructions so ‘til | went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , | only spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">When my parents spoke between themselves, they spoke a lot of Russian, so | knew those two languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  What was the relationship to your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  | was always told by my father that | am the oldest one and | have to take care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And, also, my sister was a very pretty, feminine, little girl and she could get away with a lot that | couldn't because my father decided very early that | have to be a doctor and | was a good student in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but | was always knew that | have to have very good grades because, this, | was the oldest one and | had to further my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My sister was not a too good student and she didn't like the except she liked pretty dresses, like that, but she had no obligation to be a very good student because my father decided that she is going to marry a well-to-do person, a professional who will take very good care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, it was always understood that | was the serious one and she was the little woman, and we accepted it, of course, we didn’t have big fight but sometimes little fights like who, we had braids, who the nanny, who should braid the hair before, me or her? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And, little, little, things, but it was always put in my mind that | am the oldest one and | have to take care of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  What did it mean, in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and your family, to be Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  You see, as a child, | didn't really, was exposed to much to the rich because my parents, being students and being, and this time with the Russian revolution, didn't, were not religious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And, | really didn’t even so much know that | was Jewish but, later on, we lived in, very close to, the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and there were riots in, near the medical faculty, because the Jewish students attended the faculty, were suppose to sit on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So instead of them sitting on the left, they was standing up and taking notes and when the riots were occurring and the nanny used to pick me up from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and | heard, and then | was very much aware of my father’s suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My mother had a lot of Polish patience and she had a very good reputation that she was taking out, doing extraction, taking out teeth, and very big, tall, well-to-do, landowners used to come with their horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> and the driver used to wait for them and they to go up to my mother, kiss her hand, and bring us fresh strawberries and all this kinds and she didn’t hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But, when it happened to my father, when it happened to the students we were well aware that we are Jews and that we are not wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  | think the riots started, | would say, as far as | remember, my farth___ (ph) were in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The riots at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was in ‘36-37. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The Poles were very anticipated(ph) and they told that all there misfortunes were caused by those people that were taking away everything from them, that those people were well to do, that those people were not telling the true, but the truth is that there were a lot, a lot, very poor Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There was a whole section in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Vienna(ph), where there was such a poor Jews living in <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , the children were dying from tuberculosis and all the related sicknesses; but, | was always brought up with the mind that charity’s very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We always had boxes for orphan children, we always had a box to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Even my parents were not, this times ; And, when my mother passed away, she had a very big funeral and a lot of people that | didn't know that exist, came over to me and told me that even she had a very big practice, all the poor people, from all around who knew, that they can come to the dentist, Gutalip Carich Masur(ph), in the middle of the night, she will take care of them and she will never, never, ask them for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , | meet a woman who was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and she a little bit more bread, and she came over to me and she gave me one potato and piece of bread, and she says to me, “! </span><span class="sentence" id="63">am one of those patients that your mother helped” and, you know, it was in very bad taste, in my mother's circle, if you did something good, you never tell it, you never brag about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">You do it and It's, ...so | never knew about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  So the first tragedy in your life really occurred when your mother died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  And then the second major in your life was in 1941 when the invasion came, the Polish invasion came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The second one was September 1, 1939, when the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> raided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ; because, as it happens, this time, it was summertime, and | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie(ph</span> ) where my father had the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , maybe 20 minutes by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genow(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And, me and my sister were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie(ph</span> ) on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And, also, | have to mention that after my mother passed away, my mother had an older sister, her name was Sonya Lickowvitchpersky(ph), who was a registered nurse and a mid-wife; and she became our second mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">She was always very close with us because those two sisters were very close and apparently my mother, on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span> , asked her to take care of her two little girls, so she became our second mother, and she spend, sometimes summertime, she went there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie(ph</span> ) with us and then she left us and went back to her husband in Vienna(ph) where was her <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> , she didn’t have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And, so, on September 1, | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie(ph</span> ) and, as it happens, there was a pact made. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Vienna(ph) became a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie</span> became a part of <span class="REGION">White Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">SO we were, we're now only with our father and we were separated from our second mother and it was just terrible, but our whole life was up-side-down, from this time, because when the Russian came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie</span> , you know, the first thing what they did, they said that my father is a rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They called him bourgeois and they didn’t give him a passport and he was now like an enemy of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Even he, he didn't do anything to..., he was working very hard to be an owner, he was considered persona-nongratta(ph) and | couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie</span> because there was no <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and | just started go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so | was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dushanitover(ph</span> ) was the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and my father rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there and | attended this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and | was always, always, separated from my sister, was staying with my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie(ph</span> ) because there was a <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So there very, very, big upheaval and | was studying there ‘til 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">| visited once, my aunt, and | had other family, my aunt, my second and that was in Vienna(ph) and | had all the, two cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Because my father arranged somehow to gave a permission during the vacation, to come to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And, when | came there and stayed with my Aunt, | was looking for my friends from my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and it was a complete division, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my beloved <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...the children couldn't go there because they had to learn Lithuanian and some of them went to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was a big, big, upheaval in our young life. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So when | came back, | was heartbroken because everything that was dear to me was kind of destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But, then came June, 1941...this was when the German army came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but before they came, | wanted to tell you that my father was thrown out from, by the Russian, from the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> , and he was made a manager in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astroegetts(ph</span> ), so they had to move there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And, of course, he was very disappointed, but he was trying to do his best and he became very friendly with a young doctor that was living just near us, and this was actually in his only companion because the cultural level of the town people were very low. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So here | am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astroegetts(ph</span> ), | just came for vacation, it was June, and I’m sitting and reading a book, and | remember what book | was reading...| was reading the book in Russian and it was by the son of Tolstoy and it was about Peter the Great. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And, | am sitting and reading the book and they are describing, describing the banquette with all kinds of exotic food that they are giving and they are talking about black grapes, that | never saw in my life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> within and they are talking about peaches that | never saw and here | am reading this book and the maid came running from the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> and saying “Your father wants you right away, the German invaded and they are coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We were strangers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astorgetts(ph)</span> ...we just couldn't make friends in such a short time so we didn’t have, like, roots there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">When | cam running, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> standing with Russian doctors and Russian nurses who were good friends of my father and they asked my father we should go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they will take us to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And, my father took me and my sister into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and said, “My children, during the war, a person has to have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over their head, a <span class="DLF">roof</span> is very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">| know the German invited us when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and some how they were even so | don't believe that they will do any harm to me, after all, | am a law-abiding person and | am professional.” </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So, we were standing there...as soon as the Russian left, in a few more hours, the maid of the young doctor, there was a friend of my father came running up and said that the doctor told me to tell you there will be a program (you know what is a program) tonight and since you are the most prominential in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you will be the first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So he said, “Leave everything and go someplace, because you will be killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There was a rabbi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so my father went to the rabbi and told him and the rabbi said, “Okay, you stay here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And, low and behold, this night was a very big program...we heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There were peasant(ph) with those big things that you clean the <span class="DLF">street</span> , | forgot how to say it in

had to have yellow, a star, this, Stars of David, and they also had to walk in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So it took us a few hours and | was walking with my sister on the <span class="DLF">street</span> like two little Polish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And when my aunt saw us, she thought that we came from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , who know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Of course, she was very, very happy and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">A few days later, my father came. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And my father, from all the aggravation of everything, became ill and had a very big abscess. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And also, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , the Jews were persecuted like subhumans. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Every day, new edicts were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We couldn't have a radio, we couldn't have a jewelry, we couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have properties, we couldn't talk to gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">| mean, we were plain ostracizes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And every day they used to come and take out men and young boys and they used to disappear and the women never knew where they were and what was done to these young . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">One of my uncles, my mother's sister's husband, was taken from the <span class="DLF">street</span> , he was standing and reading an edict, he was taken from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So the situation was very, very tense and my father was very ill and he was afraid to go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But once he became so ill and the abscess that he had was so big that during the night, he decided that he had to go, so my uncle and my aunt took him by the hand and they were walking in the middle of the night, they took him to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And he was staying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And my other uncle no, never went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And when the Gestapo used to come and ask if there are men there, she used to come out and, luckily, they would look in a few <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and my, he was camouflaged, something, so my uncle was never found. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So it was, until, until, | don't remember exactly the date, | think it was June 6, 19, no, no, no, September 6, 1941, that an edict came that all the Jews have to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But it was such a diabolic, diabolic plan, a master plan, the way they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">There was, as | told you, there was a section, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> in the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , a very, very <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cultural town</span> that had a lot of <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> and <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and it had, and Jewish, very rich Jewish life with <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> and all kinds of societies and charitable organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And there were a lot of Jewish doctors that had a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And also, there were a lot of facilities for poor Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">In the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> was a section where very poor Jews lived, it was in very bad conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The German came there in the middle of the night, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , told all those Jews to walk out, put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and took them to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukishke(ph</span> ) and also took them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponare(ph</span> ), it was a place where those Jews was lined up and shot discriminately, first they had to make their own <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and they were falling in those <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">When | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , sick in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that | will tell you later, one of the woman who escaped between the dead bodies came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and in the beginning when she was just a little lucid, she described what happened to her, so we knew for a fact that it was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And then, after a few days, she lost her mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">| still remember her yelling and screaming and crying after the children that she lost there, after the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So it was, a very diabolic plan how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When we were told to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they came, everything was done early in the morning, and my uncle, Yosef(ph) Perski(ph), said to my aunt, "Look, | am not going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ". </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He was, had a very big advantage, he doesn't look Jewish, he look like a gentile, he look like a Pole and he was a business man that had a lot of connections with Polish peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He was buying wood there from them and also dried mushrooms, he says, "| am going there and | want you to go with me". </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She says, she, my aunt Sonja, who was like a second mother to us, said to him, "I promised my sister on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span> that | am, be a second mother and | will take care of those two little girls, Lilla({ph) and Rhya(ph)," this was how we were called, "And | won't leave them alone". </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So they kissed and he sneaked out and he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We never heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And she went with us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Before he left, he gave us a few things to put on and as we were walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , | had one coat and one raincoat and the Poles were lined up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and looking at, and | will never forget that they said, "Look at those Jews, they have two coats". </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So they were, nobody of them lifted a finger and said, "Come, | give you food, | won't let you go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ", because they really were rejoicing what was happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There were two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the people that were taken to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that | was, were destined to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a lot of people were taken, again, to the <span class="BUILDING">Lukishke prison</span> , from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponare</span> , and they were simply shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So this way the have the liquidated a lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Before the war, before 1939, there were 80,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> was a culture center, with many institutions, it was a culture Jewish center that was like a magnet from all the people that wanted to soak up and had a nice cultural experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So slowly, slowly the Jewish population were reduced and also, at this time, there were all other people, Jews, that escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , that escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that look for solace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , and they, unfortunate, were also put to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">| can talk for hours and hours about those conditions that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It is indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was habitated four or five family. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There was no sanitary conditions, there was not even enough water. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The rations were terrible, | mean, it's not to live and not to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And the most important thing is, that the . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">All those people that were doers, that were thinkers, that were writers, became so helpless, so degradated, so broken up, that they just couldn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">| remember that my father, whenever that there was something in the family, they used to come, they with Mazur, he knew everything, he was, he felt that he can help, he felt that he can, so was the most helpless person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He was like a hunted animal and | think this was the biggest injustice that was done to Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">By dehumanize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The taking away their self-esteem, the taking away their pride, the taking away their human dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">| know that you want to ask me how | meet my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Okay, you can ask me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Actually, | wanted to ask you, at this time, you and your sister were two teenage girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  How did, how did you cope, how did you feel at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  | felt very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">| felt very bad because | was emotionally broken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">| remember, | was walking with my sister in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were surrounded with <span class="DLF">walls</span> and there was one very big <span class="DLF">door</span> , like an <span class="DLF">opening</span> , what was mind from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> for Jewish policemen, for the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> by Gestapo and Lithuanian policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So come out and come in, we were, there was a lot of, you had to have papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But | remember walking with my sister around and we were standing by a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and | heard from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , human voices, walking and | heard children and I, | could hear that they were going and also | heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , music from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carousel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And | was standing there and | was thinking, will you tell me that nobody cares about us? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Will you tell me that children are going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they're going to the movies, that people are going, doing their jobs and nobody cares? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">This was the hope, the biggest, | was hungry, | was dirty, | was really in rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">| was cold, but what's hurting me, | was humiliated. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And | couldn't understand that nobody in the world will speak up for us and ask, "Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="195">What are those people, how those people mistreated? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Why did they do, why, how are they singled out, to be put to such a torture and misery?" </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And this was the biggest, the biggest thing that | couldn't understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  So how did you meet up with your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  You see, | was there with, in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and once my aunt, who was a nurse, was walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she met somebody that she knew and she said to her, "Where are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And she says, "| am going to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , | hope that my brother-in-law is there". </span><span class="sentence" id="201">She says to me, "Oh, your brother-in-law is in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he is crying, he is crying, where are his daughters, where are his, where is his family? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He is beside himself, he doesn't want to get better". </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And she took her by the hand and showed him where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So he stayed a very short time in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they didn't pamper people, they didn't have time for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Later on he came and he stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">In a very short time after, we were starving and also, my father was a smoker, he smoked, so this, the cigarette that he smoked, they were not real cigarette, but a homemade cigarette, many times | used to wake up and | used to see him smoking at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And once he went out and he found a job, they were looking for people to work in, not as a pharmacist, but to work in a <span class="BUILDING">Spanish hospital</span> that were outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And he was going every day and he was working there just as a laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And then one day, he met somebody and they and they told him they are looking for a pharmacist to look in, to work in a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> because it was the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> that was in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they needed a pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So he was very happy and very elated and, of course, they took him right in and he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We were starving so much that at night sometimes we couldn't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they give us such a small ration that they gave us this piece of bread when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , me and my sister, we finished already the bread, so you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">As much as my aunt wanted to share the rations with us and may times she shared with us, it was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So one day | decided, | heard that people are going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they are working. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So one time | got up very early in the morning and we had, in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judenrat(ph</span> ) and there were people that, from the Jewish, that community, that were like in charge of the ghetto, they were, and one of those that was in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was Jacob Gentz(ph), who was an officer in the Lithuanian army and he was like a Jewish commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And right there there was a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> and German used to come and take men and women, we were always segregated, to work and | was lucky enough that | was recruited by this German, his name was Kraus(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And he took, he took me to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">There was, maybe a handed, two handed young girls, and he, he took us out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were working on the cobblestones and we were working, working, working a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And all of a sudden, the whole column stopped and to my amazement, they stopped in front of the <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> where | spend the happiest days of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They took us down there, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was occupied by Gestapo and from the <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> they made <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And there was a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> there that when | was a student, | didn't even know that that existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And they put us into this big <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> was full with potatoes and we had to sort out the potatoes, they were rotten and so there | was, sitting in this , in this big <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and | was thinking, this must be a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">| wanted to run, run out from there, run to one of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">classrooms</span> , sit down in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , there was sitting late, and | said to myself, | am running out, | will take the hardest test, | don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And then all of a sudden | see a man walking there and taking care of chicken, there were a few chicken there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">He looked terrible, , this was Professor Morgenstern(ph), he was the latest of my teachers and he was like the teacher that took care of our class. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And when my mother passed away and in our religion, for seven days, we sit shiva, he came to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he was talking to me, because when my mother was sick, my grades fell very badly because | didn't want to study and | was there always the teacher's pet. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">| was very good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And he was talking to me and he said, "Look, I'm sure that you, if you will just put your head to it, you can have a makeover test and you will have better grades". </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But | remember saying to him, "I really, at this point, | really don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">For me, the world is finished". </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So to my amazement, Professor Morgenstern is standing there and taking care of the chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You see, we are not supposed to socialize with men, this was the biggest crime, but | ran over to him, | said, "Professor Morgenstern". </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But he didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He went through a very big tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">In his presence, his wife and his daughter and his son were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And he was in such a state of shock, that he was just like an out mad(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="237">As | was sitting there crying, afraid to cry loud because there were, full of sad, | see the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens and two girls and a man are coming out, this was the janitor and his two Polish daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">When | was a little girl and we were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the janitor and his two daughters were always helping us with galoshes because the climate in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very severe in wintertime and many times we would share our lunches, we considered them our friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">When they saw me sitting there, they said, "Look at this little Lilka(ph), we thought that all Jews were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponar</span> ". </span><span class="sentence" id="240">This was the hello that | had from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They were standing with their hands on their hips and they were practically laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Okay, the day ended and | came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and | was beside myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was just a little bit too much for me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to see my professor and to hear those talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Anyhow, look, | was going there and working there for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And one advantage was that we could bring a few raw potatoes, but by the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , if they would caught us with potatoes, we would be shot on site. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But we learned how to camouflage it, you know, and sometimes we were lucky, they would let us through, and those potatoes were very helpful because my father used to sell them and we could buy something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">After a while this job finished and this same German took us to an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Porbanek(ph</span> ) and, again, | started to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Probanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We were working long, long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They brought us over, they used to always line us up and count us and the job with it was unload big pieces of coal, unload wood, unload potatoes and many times in the winter, we had to clean the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The snow was falling and there we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And we saw those military little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming down and all those military men in their white warm coats and there we were freezing practically, we had no, no warm clothes and | had a very big problem because the shoes that | had were falling apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So my father went to the Judenrat and they gave me a pair of shoes, they were wooden clumps(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They were wooden, you know, and with presented some material, when | was working in the snow | couldn't walk because the snow was, it was just sticking, so it was a very big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But one day, when we were lined up, | was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Every day four women were chosen to go into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">This was a very big thing because you, it was wintertime, you didn't have to freeze. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And | was lucky, | was chosen with all those four women. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So there | was, standing in this big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and | was given a bucket of water and a mop and | have to mop those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Here you have me, | was just a school girl, who never in her life boiled a pot of tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">| didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So there were, the other three women who were more experienced , took their bucket and they knew what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They took me and put it in this big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that you couldn't see from one end to another and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was dirty and there | was standing, | didn't Know how to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">| know how to do it today, but | didn't know then and | was standing there and crying, bitter tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">All of a sudden, like an apparition, a very high German officer is coming with a few younger around him and he sees me and he says to me, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And at this time, | spoke a very good German yet, today | cannot speak German, | have a mental block. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">In a very clear German, | said to him, "| am Jewish, brought in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to wash it and | don't Know how to do it". </span><span class="sentence" id="267">End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Tape 2 He looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">| don’t know what...he called in a soldier, told a soldier to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , took me by the hand and took me to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , said to me “Are you hungry?” </span><span class="sentence" id="270">| was afraid to say, so | put my head down and he told another German to bring me a sandwich and hot soup, and then | was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He said to me, “You are Jewish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="272">| said, “Yes,” and he started to ask me my whole story and then | was sitting and conversing with this man and | became so...the hot soup...and the sandwich make me so, you know, courageous, that | didn't, | said to him, you want me, | Know, you want me to recite for you the Early King by Getta(ph); so, he says to me, “You know the Early King?” </span><span class="sentence" id="273">| said, “Yes” and then | was, | said | will stand down and | will recite it for you, there I’m scared to death, reciting the Early King for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And, this man says to me, “You are Jewish?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="275">Yes,” | said, “Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He said, “They told us that all the Jews are crooked, have crooked noses, they have beards, they are liars, they are cheaters.

<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  We use to stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">A lot of friendship used to form that even today’s survivors, that because they were in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> : they were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , they are life-long friends because of a lot of survivors don’t have families, they say that she is my step-sister, she is my sister, she is my ghetto sister; so a lot of friendship, we used to help each other a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There were no fight, on the contrary, there was a lot of solidarity, like my aunt became like the tent mother and she used to take care of us, you know, and sometime if she could, she would give a piece of bread to us because she said “Il am old, | don’t need so much food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So we used to stick a lot together, there was a lot of solidarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">| was later separated from my aunt and my two cousins and | was just with my sister, but | think a very important factor in this, our survival, was because | was with my sister; because when my father used to say as a little girl, “You have to take care of your sister.” </span><span class="sentence" id="374">| took it very seriously and | was afraid to die that, wnat would happen to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So this was a very important factor.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  You see, when | came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , | learned Yiddish, | learned it and | met there a lot of people that in normal times, even they were Jews, | would never come in contact with them; so it was like a very big cultural revelation for me and a very big teaching, said what very big teaching that, so | spoke fluent Yiddish and | spoke fluent, of course, Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We didn’t use too much Russian but those two languages were prevalent, like with my aunt and my two cousins, my sister we spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But with other people, we spoke Yiddish, we spoke Jewish, so this was the two languages that we used.

<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  And at this point you are on and your cousins were not with you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  You wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  | wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , because the last time when | saw my father, was in Kaiser (sp) concentration camp and he was came with the transport from Estonia(ph) and he was going around and asking for his little daughters; and | was at time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinawarkee(ph</span> ), so when somebody came, there is a Mr. Margules who is looking for his little daughters, so when | heard about it, they use to send us to Kaiser___(ph) to have our teeths pulled, so | thought that, said that, | have a tooth ache. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And | went there and | saw my father, in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , there(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Whenever | remember my father, | was always seeing him a vigorous young handsome man, so when | saw my father, there was somebody standing there but it was not my father and | recognize him by his voice and by his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So | risk my life and | went to the <span class="BUILDING">men’s barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But because at this time, | was dressed like a man with a jacket and pants, so they didn't recognize me, and since | didn't have hair anyway, | looked like a little boy, young boy, anyhow; and | found him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Of course, he embraced me and asked me where is my little sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And this was the time that my little sister had rheumatic fever, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinawarkee(ph</span> ) in the crankeovere(ph) and you couldn't be sick, but there are certain things in life that are just in explainable. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">The doctor, the assess(ph) doctor that was taking of the people in the crankeovere(ph) had a daughter that was the same age as my sister and as | told you, my sister was a very pretty little girl, and he felt sorry for her because she looked like his daughter a lot, so he used to take out medicine from the assessment and give it to her and he didn’t tell nobody that he was keeping, he kept her for a couple months; otherwise she would be sent back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and she would never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So when my father asked me, how is my sister, | told him, “She is alright.” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So he says to me, come tomorrow and | want to see her; and he said to me, like this, when we will survive, we have to come to Sole(ph) to the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">| don’t you anything, just two things, first, take care of your sister and second, remember who you are and bring me a good name back. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So this stayed with me for the whole, whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Next there when | went, he wasn't there already; and my sister of course was very sick so she couldn't...but he never knew it; and this was the last time that | saw my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But WHEN | was sent from Soapert(ph) to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , | was very anxious to go and see because when, after the liberation, when we got to little Beartta(ph) we were looking for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We were two little young girls, all alone, with shaved hair, very slim, with no money and no family. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So the first thing we were looking for our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We never heard about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We wrote letters, we were, there were all kinds of organizations, we never heard about him; BUT, on our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we were traveling by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and it was a very dangerous situation because there was, there was actually no laws, and two girls were very, very easy prey to anybody, but we had, how you say this rupsack(ph), yeh?, </span><span class="sentence" id="467">on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and you what we're having, black bread, dry bread, because we said when we have bread, we don’t need anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So people had stockings, people had dresses, we had two those things on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with bread; and then when we stopped on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> we use to take a little water and this was what we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lougue(ph</span> ), we met a lot of Jewish people and we started to talk and over there, also, we met a girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> --she was older than us--and we became like a trio. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And she was a very smart girl, very educated, she was a university student studying medicine and she was one of the students that didn't want to stand...sit, on the left it was standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Much more experience that me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So she was talking to people and she was told that there is a <span class="DLF">border</span> under we were book(ph) and if it pass the <span class="DLF">border</span> it will be <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ...If we come to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , we will never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And as we were standing there and talking to people a girl, that was together with us at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , pass by and she recognize us; and she says to me “What are you doing there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So we said to her, “We are going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="475">She said, “Don’t go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But you see, she says, “You cousin’s wife is her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lougue(ph</span> ); she is in her brother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Why don’t you go there and sleep over?” </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So we all, so she took my older friend because she had also a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and me and my sister, w went to my cousin- in-law, you know (chuckle), and she of course, she never expected that we will live and she never expected to see us and spent a lot of time together because was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinawarkee(ph</span> ); so she treated us very nice, she gave us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , she gave us food, we sleep; and in the morning she had a conference with her brother...What to do with us? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So they decided that in Lougue(ph) on Sahoniya(ph) 20, there was kibbutz(ph) and they were collecting all this orphans and they was planning to educate them and send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So the next day we went there to the 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">When we came there...you want to ask me something?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  Before we go on to the next <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , what was the situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Were you together with non-Jewish persons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  No, no, ever, all the, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> displaced people came, they were only Jewish survivors there, there was the UNRA(ph), that was helping there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We had supervision by the doctors and also, we had rations, you know, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And tt, we were, we felt very disappointed because we didn't want it to be charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We didn't want charity cases, we didn't want to be supported by somebody, we want to be self, self-substaining, we wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we wanted to learn some, a profession or something, hand, you know, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So we were very, but we were told that this is just a transition, that we are on our way to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and when we, when we come to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , we will board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it will take us to our promised land. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You know, many times we were taken to movies, they were trying to make our life as pleasant as possible, but it, we lost a lot of self- esteem and also, the stigma to being a displaced person to any thinking young person was very degredating, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And we didn't have too much books to read, the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , they, as much as they stocked it to educate us and the kibbutz were having all kinds of workshops and things like this, but still we were hungry for knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So finally, here we are on Christmas night crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">| mean, it was a very hard experience and we were crossing as Greeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And imagine what a coincidence, in the same night my husband, my future husband whom | didn't know, was also crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and wanted to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , | didn't know him, he didn't know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But before he left, he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and before he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , his sister-in-law baked him a batch of cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And he was being generous and as we were crossing the Alps in the snow at night, he was giving out cookies and | ate one of his cookies without knowing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">When | met him, he told me that the night, and | said to him, "Oh, | ate your cookie". </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So finally, it was a very arduous journey and, because of the boys that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , were helping the girls, we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Because we were sliding, we were sliding from the <span class="DLF">passages</span> there and finally we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  How did you cross? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">On foot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  On foot, we crossed on foot in the middle of the night and we crossed by foot because it was not officially, and we will be caught, even we had, we were told that we are Greeks, you know, but it was an operation, we were just, we were, those people, the guides, knew some <span class="DLF">passages</span> , but it was very arduous in the middle of the winter crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Anyhow, finally, they brought us to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they brought us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Adriatica(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We stayed there for awhile and then we were transferred to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torrino(ph</span> ), Turin(ph), called . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And we are settled down there, we lived in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and were taking all kinds of courses, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But we were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then one day they took us to the movies and | was sitting there in the movies and, as | told you, the girls from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> didn't know Russian because they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , only me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So they were showing a Russian movie without subtitles, so | was sitting there and explaining them in Polish what was going on and behind me was sitting a young boy with his friend and this was my husband, my future husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">My, Edward Margules. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And he was fascinated, "Who was the girl who was talking Russian?" </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Because he knew very good Russian and he wanted to meet, so when the lights went up, he saw me and in this times | had two long, very long hair and | still, | think | was wearing braids at this time, looking very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So he found out where | am and he asked some guys from, to introduce me. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And he started to court me. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and | was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And when he was courting me, he started to talk to me and he found out that | like opera, that | like ballet, that | like <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , so he would take me to the city of Milan and he would get to <span class="BUILDING">La Scala</span> ; and this was the first time that | saw <span class="BUILDING">La Scala</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Twice he took me, once we saw Sampson and Delilah. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And then, | saw another opera, | cannot think, I'm a little nervous, | cannot think about it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And once on our trip, | told him that I'm looking for my father, so he said he heard that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> , there is a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> that people, displaced people, are putting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> that are looking for this, are looking for this, so we went there before the performance, we came a little earlier and | put two notices. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">One, that me and my sister are looking for my father and then | had like a, | think | remember, | had a visual memory, | remembered that letters used to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and they were always addressed to my father and the return address was like an |. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Mazur, this | saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So | said, you know, | know that | have an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , so let me put a notice up that | am looking for my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And | didn't remember his first name, | just put |. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Mazur. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">As it happens, my young, my uncle was a younger brother of my father, was living <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span> and he was also looking for survivors of his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He was a very well-to-do business man who had connections with Italians that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> and he wrote to these people that he heard that there are displaced persons, maybe you could go to this and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And this man, the Italian guy, went there and saw on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> that two girls are looking for their uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He telegraphed him and one day, | got a telegram in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that | should come and there on the <span class="DLF">Garibaldi(ph) Street</span> and that | should come and look for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">When | went there he was a very nice gentleman, very well-to-do, a very elegant <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and he says that my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> is looking for, and he sent him a telegram and he said that we should go to the <span class="BUILDING">Argentine embassy</span> , and he will help us to make the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">At this time, Jews were not accepted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So my uncle was so elated that he found two girls and that was, that he went to a very big attorney and gave him a blank check and he said, "| want my nieces to be taken out from Europe and brought over here". </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And he made us papers as Episcopalians because my name is Leah(ph) on my papers and her name is Rachael(ph), but in the meantime, when we were waiting for the papers, we didn't know, my kibbutz had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And | went to the elders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and | said to him | don't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Because in the meantime | was already established and everybody liked me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and | was already having my position, you Know, so he says, I've met this guy and he wants to marry me, but he doesn't want to join the kibbutz. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He has a different idea, he was a different, but he wants me to stay with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We were talking back and forth and he said to me, "Look, | know that you are very dedicated to the kibbutz, it's very good, but you have to look for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">You are alone with your sister". </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We didn't know about my uncle then, and if you found a young boy that you like, you have to , you have the obligation to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Low and behold, there was a big wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">There was the two kibbutz's and | had to, | knew my husband only three months because or | marry him. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He said to me, "But you have to marry him, you cannot just stay and be his girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">This was not done.", </span><span class="sentence" id="615">he says, "I have the obligation to you, you have to marry him. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We'll make you a very big wedding". </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And it was just a few days before they left and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> for, to board this very big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But they landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cypress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Anyhow, there was a very big wedding made in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and there were 400 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">| didn't have a dress, my sister didn't have a dress, so my husband gave us money and we went and he bought us the material, and he bought us underwear and shoes, we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And imagine the present that my kibbutz gave me, a very big plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">| didn't have anything, this was a plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And then from, it was a very big thing that two survivors are getting married, so from, you know, from <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> , from they came and they gave us such presents that it is just ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Anyhow...
