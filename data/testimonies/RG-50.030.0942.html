<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> my parents — my father had just gone there to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We soon after moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with my family owned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , on <span class="DLF">Via Canova</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And such is the world — Via Canova is in the center, near the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and so on — such 1s the world that now that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="DLF">Via Canova</span> is in the center, near the castle and so on — such 1s the world that now that house, which was our house, is the <span class="BUILDING">Turkish consulate</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  No kidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Well that — that leads me to a question that usually would be way towards the end of the interview, but I'll ask 1t now so I don’t forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">If 1t was your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you left it, was it that it was confiscated from you, or you so — your family sold it?July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, we sold it after the war, it was damaged, we sold it for almost nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It was damaged because some bombs had hit nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">How we managed, somehow, to keep properties is — is part of the story —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  — that is — yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And then another question that seems self-evident, but it’s part of our format is, can you tell me, what was your name at birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My name was Guido Calabresi, no —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  As it is today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  As it is today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Okay, no changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  No changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about both your mother and your father, starting with their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Bianca Maria Finzi-Contini, and married to Calabresi. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">She was born actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , because her father, who was a — an early neurologist, he studied with Charcot, the teacher of Freud. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">About the same time, he decided that much of it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , he inherited some money, and kept up. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He said, someday it will all be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That’s kind of nice, because his great-July 27, 2017 grandchildren, one my gran — my daughter, is a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My brother’s son is a neurologist professor at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So it’s come round.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  But he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  And Finzi-Contini originally all came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , but the family had transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> quite early and — and was a family that was responsible for much of the urban development of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They owned a good deal of the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  The kind of key figure in all this was a man named Leon Vita Finzi-Contini, who was born in 1776, and who — whose <span class="DLF">grave</span> is in the Jewish cemetery in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in Bologna. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He had many children by his first wife, who went in all different directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Some are very actively practicing Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">One is a— was a relative in some other way, is a good friend, is a professor of economics in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Turin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And some married Catholic nobles, and became immensely rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">One of the great art collections in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> is the Contini Bonacossi Collection in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , and they are all descendants. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They didn’t always behave well, so it — the family, they — I mean — July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  In what way’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  They — they had dealings with the — with the Nazis, and so on, and so the family sort of ignored them. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But that was — he then married a second wife, and we descend from his second wife, and — and — but part of that 1s the reason why the name Finzi-Contini is one that gets used.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Well, that was — I mean, of course, that’s one of the questions that I was going to ask later, but I’ll ask it now, is — 1s of course the movie, that was ever —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  — you know, so very popular, “The Garden of the Finzi-Continis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  So let me first say something about my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Well, one other thing about my mother’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Her mother is of a family that claims to have been brought by Titus in his triumph, in 70 Common Era. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Caesar Roff(ph) says it’s so. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1900 says it’s so. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There were — when the Romans conquered a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they tended to bring princes, kings and so on in their trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When the conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , they brought judges, priests and elders. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We were the elders. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Zekanym(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  PIl tell you, I have — I’m sorry to interrupt. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I have never met somebody who could trace his family back —July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — more than 200 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Never mind 2,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Well, so they came as, in the tribe — I— I must say, I haven’t seen anybody — I went to the Arch of Titus, nobody looks like my great-uncle, carrying the menorah, but there it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Anyway, they came as — as slaves, originally, became tutors to the emperors. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Followed the emperors to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravenna</span> when the western empire went there, and when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugo</span> , where they set up <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> as bankers, moneylenders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Because we are Italkim; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazim, we are people who were there before the diaspora, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> — there’s a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> which is the Italian one. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Obvious rite. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And that was what our tradition was on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And so these people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately lent enough money to the pope so that he gave them permission to practice their trade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I think the popes meant by trade, banking, money-lending. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">These people said, but we are teachers of law, because they were rabbis of the Italian rite. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And so, I don’t know if it’s true, but somehow — but the — the legend 1s that the way we got into law teaching was because of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Anyway, so —July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How did you learn of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Oh, this is all family tales and stories that ha — have been, and I just enjoy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Well, anyway, that <span class="DLF">line</span> is one which was very self-important, for obvious reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  And my grandmother married my grandfather, this — of this very good family, with high intellectual traditions, and so on, and going back hundreds of years in itself, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But that gave that name a certain connotation, of elegance, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My — I said to my mother — my mother said aristocracy, I said decadence, she said it’s the same thing, Guido. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And there it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  A child would say that to his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Let me then take my father’s family, and — because that deals with this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My father’s family, the Calabresi, were, according to their tradition, which isn’t as proven as the other, were traders in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> in Republican time. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">That is even earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Now, it is a fact that the largest number of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> who were not Romans, at the time of the Roman Republic, before Julius Caesar, before the empire and so on, were Jews, who were traders. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There were about 15 — 2500. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Different figures, but a significant number of people who were Jews trading. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the story, in that side of the family is that they stayed there, and when — and settled somewhere south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , where we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In 1496, everything from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> south was July 27, 2017 Spanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , 1496 from Spanish territory, <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> <span class="REGION">Spanish territory</span> , and Jews were expelled in 1492 from Spain, 1496 from <span class="REGION">Spanish territory</span> , Portugal and <span class="REGION">Spanish territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Two people went from somewhere south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And there is a document which says two people came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Calabria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Today <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calabria</span> is just the toe. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , at the time, they called everything from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> south, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Calabria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And said where two people came, bought lands — because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> was very open to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I’ll show you some pictures [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And because they came from Le Calabria and there were two of them, we called them Calabrese, which means people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calabria</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Calabria</span> and there were two of them, we called them Calabrese, which means people from Calabria. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Calabrese with an e, meaning person, is quite a common name in the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Calabresi with an iis unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It isn’t always just descendants of these two, but a lot are descendants of these two, and with an i, it often is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">With and e — not always, but often is — with an e, almost never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  We — the other <span class="DLF">line</span> had many children, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We were down to none, until my father was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He was the only male of his generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So my grandfather tried to see if these two were related. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Then my father was born, and he lost interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Anyway, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , joined the <span class="BUILDING">Italian synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and they joined the Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But it wasn’t because they were angry with the Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">If you look at the ruins of theJuly 27, 2017 Spanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated us so well, when we were in their <span class="REGION">territory</span> <span class="BUILDING">Spanish synagogue</span> , you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated us so well, when we were in their territory. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So it — they were Italkim, who had to be Sephardic when this was Spanish territory, got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> <span class="REGION">Spanish territory</span> , got to Ferrara, found an <span class="BUILDING">Italian synagogue</span> and joined up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story that they went back, is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They married into another very, very old and very wealthy family of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , Minerbi, who are also — again, the family is all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">One of them, Sergio Minerbi is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and was the ambassador of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to the unite — to Europe, and — and at one point to the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> , which he didn’t much like. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But he — anyway, this family is a major, major family, and had — and members of the family still do — had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> — and I’Il show you on the map of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> afterwards, where — which go back to the 13" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My father’s first cousin and best friend, was the patron of Bassani, the man who wrote the book from which the movie was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He helped him financially, and Bassani wrote the book, that book and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He dedicated one to my cousin, but he wrote that book and others in that family house, in the library of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="BUILDING">family house</span> , in the library of that house. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And he —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Minerbi? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">In the <span class="BUILDING">Minerbi family house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">Minerbi family house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he told my father’s cousin in the courtyards of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I’m writing a book, and I’m going to call it, “The Garden of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finzi-Contini</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Why did he pick my mother’s name — July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  —1n my father’s family’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Nobody knows this, but I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  And the story, I’m sure, is this. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">His patron’s younger sister, my mother’s — my father’s first cousin —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And his father’s first cousin’s name was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Giuseppe Minerbi, Beppe Minerbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And as I say, he dedicated another book, ‘The Heron,” to him, and there are any number of things about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Beppe had a younger sister, who married my mother’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They met at our — my parents’ wedding, married. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So that it was not surprising that he would think, in this guy’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , of a younger — near his age, not his age, person named Finzi-Contini. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then, the fact that Finzi-Contini connoted all sorts of things, pleased him. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Now —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did he have to get permission?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  — the story — well, there’s the — the story is — bu — the story in the movie and so on, isn’t about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I can tell you almost everything that happened, whom it happened to. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And some happened to one, some happened to another, and — and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But it wasn’t our story, with one possible, interesting exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But certainly not the Finzi-Contini. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Did he have to get permission? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We thought that he had not,July 27, 2017 and my mother was kind of annoyed at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">In the papers of my double cousin, that is this son of my mother’s brother and my father’s cousin —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Minerbi —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — who died a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  And who was my age, and very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We found a letter that he had not particularly seen, because he — he never talked about — and he would have, we’ve talked about the thing, to his father, my uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  From Barani(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  From Bassani.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Bassani, excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Saying, I’m writing a book, and I want to call it “The Garden of the Finzi- Contini.” </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I thought of you because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So that I am quite sure of the story — nobody knows this, but 1t’s so — and I’m — that he sort of asked for permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And that’s how that came to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Did your mother fa — did you find tha — were you able to tell your mother this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  No, my mother was long since dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  It went pa — okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  I just learned this two years ago, when my cousin died. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  My mother made peace with Bassani. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was an intere — that’s another story, that is really to decide, but —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Well, let’s come — I mean, I do want to discuss the —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  — “The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,” as a movie, as a work of art, as something that is —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And as — also as — yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Because where it — there are interesting questions about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Bassani himself didn’t like the movie for certain reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Oh, did he? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He pulled himself away, and then it’s a reason, all which have to do with the treatment of Jews during that time, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So let’s — I'd like to talk about that, but let’s leave that for later, so that we make a distinction between what is truly your family’s story —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  — and then —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span><span class="sentence" id="167">July 27, 2017</p>

<p>QUESTION:  — and sometimes twisting or changing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Iam —I must say, I am awed to learn of such a history, that goes back so many centuries, and that it would be known. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I mean, there are many things that come to my mind as you’re telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Number one, that there would be enough factual knowledge to be able to support some of the stories that you hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  I mean, that is unusual in itself</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  And number two, that there is no assimilation. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And yet —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span><span class="sentence" id="552">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  —my grandmother’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And I was thinking about that, because I remember very well being at my mother’s parents’ <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I remember very well <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , where we would always go in the spring for Pasqua.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Passover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  Easter. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Pesach. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I don’t know, I mean, we didn’t celebrate either, and my grandparents didn’t celebrate either, but it was that time of year, and it’s interesting that the word for Easter in Italian is Pasqua, which is both Pesach and Easter, and that we would always go, wherein <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> was in flower by then, while <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> was likely to be foggy, so it— my memories of going to my grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , and they had a wonderful <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and the gardeners were marvelous people and played with us and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">These are wonderful memories of that — the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , as storied during the war, how it survived and didn’t and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">All of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But I have no memory of going to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , or to seeing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I was thinking about that just now, and the answer is quite obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">My grandparents were prohibited from going there by the fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So, of course I didn’t go, they didn’t go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Because they had been kicked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  And — because they had been kicked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And so, of course, we didn’t either. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Now maybe my father went to see his cousin and so on, but this was not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ,July 27, 2017 even though it was this family site on my father’s family — my mother’s family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> — but we didn’t go there, I’m quite sure, because my father — my grandfather couldn’t go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And I know that once he went, because there was a funeral of a friend, and he thought he snuck in, and they arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He — we were rich enough so that none of that mattered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  I mean, you could always buy your way out, and that, but I think the answer about why I didn’t really focus on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> until after the war is because —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Cause of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  — my branch had been exiled from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  But there was other branches of the family that could stay —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Of course, because they —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  They weren’t as wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  They were wealthy, they were there, and they were, of course, mildly anti- fascist, or anti-fascist, but they were not in trouble in the way my father and my grandfather were. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">The story is told that this cousin, who came to own these <span class="REGION">lands</span> , was a cousin who — in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , when the <span class="DLF">garden</span> was written, the son of the then proprietor, but who was already — he had studied agriculture because he was managing all these <span class="REGION">lands</span> , which were bef —July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Let’s remind us of his name, this —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  The story is told —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  — by my — my father told me, that in the 1930s, he was a — there was a prize given by the fascists for the greatest increase in, I think it was wheat production. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">He had studied agriculture and wanted to put in modern methods and so on, and was able to convince his farmers to go along with doing these. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They wanted to do things in traditional ways, and he wanted to do that, by promising them that if they won the prize, he would give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">They won the prize, and at that point the fascists said, you are to give the prize to the fascist party as a sign of solidarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He had always been, you know, philosophically anti-fascist, but hadn't done — he had always argued with my father, my father shouldn’t have gotten into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">He, stubborn, but is — look, I promised the prize to my farmers, I’m giving the prize to my farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I’m perfectly happy to give you some money, but the prize —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Goes to the farmers.</span><span class="sentence" id="586">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — goes to the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The fascists said, no the prize you have to give to the fascist party, as a symbol of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">At that point he refused, and at that point they beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He didn’t — you know, that was just an isolated —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  — incident, but it shows both — how most people were kind of going along, even if they were anti-fascist in a mild way. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And so that’s what the people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> did. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They were not — they were anti-fascist, but they weren’t going to get into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">On the other hand, at that point, he got into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Not permanent trouble, but because of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  But also on a point, you know, at the point where your father had said, I am not going to applaud, your uncle — he would have been your great-uncle, Pepe(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Beppe was his cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  Was his cousin, so he would have been your —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  He was — well, he’s a cousin, first cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  He’s cousin for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  He was the son of my great-uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  And he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , he was studying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> , the —July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But for him too, it’s a point of, in some ways, of honor, that he had made a promise, and he wanted to keep that promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And that happened many, many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">But it was — it would have been, had that happened earlier, something which could have led him to be like my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  As it happened, this was in the 30s, and then, the next thing that happens 1s, as we are desperately trying to get out, and I’m told that we had this offer of this fellowship from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  But the fascists were not anxious to have people who were so articulate, as my parents both were, come and tell people here, what things were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Because Mussolini was saying he made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> run on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  All nonsense, you know, all nonsense, because for instance, he came and opened the great new <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that my father’s chief had gotten money for. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was all anti-fascist, but Mussolini came and opened it, and all the newspapers said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So they didn’t want people here to say what it was really like. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And so the story is, that when our application for a temporary visa, to go for a term, which should haveJuly 27, 2017 been granted, somebody was told, every time it comes to the top of a pile, put it at the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Fortunately, bureaucrats don’t rip up paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So it got put at the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">This being <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , we also had somebody in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> who was told, every time it goes to the bottom —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Bring it to the —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — move it near the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He — neither of these people — this — this person didn’t have the stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Finally, finally, one day the guy who was supposed to put it at the bottom wasn’t there, and the guy — our guy had put it near the top, and the guy who was stamping was just stamping, so we got permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But by this time, it was into ni — late 1938, and everything had changed, because the racial laws had been passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So at that point, we really didn’t even need that, because we were being — we could be kicked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But the importance of a fellowship is that it gave us a way of coming into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Because <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> wasn’t accepting people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Now, do you — did your parents ever tell you about any experiences they might have had with the U.S. officials in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  We were never told that. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I do know that with this invitation to go, my father went and gave a lecture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And there got, at the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> there, immigration papers, because we had this invitation of a fellowship, and we had gotten somebody who had had business dealings with one of my grandparents, to sign an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">There’s a story about that, because that person thought that we would never need money, because we were very wealthy, and they expected that we had money abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But both my grandparents were, as I said, patriots of the old <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they had no money abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  Everything was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Everything was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , because that was the law, and they abided by it, even though they were anti-fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But these persons, and interesting was a long term story about that, about when we arrived, had signed their affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So with that, since the Italian quota was not being met, because you couldn’t leave <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> if you were — unless you were Jewish and being kicked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So it was relatively easy for us, with this invitation, and with these, to get permission —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  From the Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  — from the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So we left <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> with — as if we were going for a term —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Let’s stop —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , when we landed, as if we were with regular immigration papers.</span><span class="sentence" id="638">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I’m going to step back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">If I] understood you correctly, you were saying, according to, let’s say, the Italian bureaucracy, you were leaving temporarily —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  — for just a term. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">According to the American bureaucracy, you were immigrating to the compa — <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  Because we had both kinds of papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  Papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Now, somewhere I read that your leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was not such a straightforward thing, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Well —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  That it was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and then another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">What happened was that my mother’s parents were very much against our leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">They thought, even though the racial laws had been passed, they thought that everything would be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And in some ways, well, things were difficult, especially if you weren’t wealthy, if you were really wealthy, nothing very much happened until 1943, when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> surrendered, and the Germans came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  I’m going to interrupt here, I’m sorry to do that, but before we proceed with the story, there are going to be people who don’t know what the racial laws were —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — and what year they were passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  In 1938, at the end of 1938, Mussolini, who had previously not been particularly with Hitler — at one point he had sent troops to the Austrian border to keep Hitler from moving into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> to keep Hitler from moving into Austria, but had decided to side with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And there had been people around him who were anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But anyway, whether from — not so much from his point of view, he was a nasty man, but that — but going along with Hitler, passed laws restricting Jews in any number of dramatic ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">On the face of them, they were absolutely catastrophic, and some things hit directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">For instance, you couldn’t teach in <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , or anyplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And so my father and my aunt were immediately kicked out of their positions as professors at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  This is your aunt who taught psychology?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  This is my aunt who taught psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And so they — you know, in that, you also were not allowed, supposedly, to have help of anybody who was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But of course, some of the help you’d always had, would stay on, and you also got help of somebody — we had a French governess who was a Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">We didn’t realize what that meant, but there it was, if you were wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Now, you supposedly could not hold properties of certain sorts, and more than a certain amount — and I'll have more to say about that, how that was avoided. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And you also were not supposed toJuly 27, 2017 go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to the public schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So these were draconic laws, and they had an effect on any number of people, and created anti-Semitism, which by and large in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had not been. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">There had been some church anti-Semitism, and some church philo-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">There were people in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> who were very pro-Jews, and you know, all that complications. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But these laws were passed, and at that point, any number of things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">As to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jesuit schools</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They were <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So that many of my cousins went to <span class="BUILDING">Jesuit schools</span> , because they weren’t the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  What about you and your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  We were still, that year, we were still in <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So at 1938, we were still in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">The matter is more complicated because — and this is something I hadn't real — realized, but 1t explains some things that my oral historian found, that in the Italian racial laws, who was not considered Jewish for certain purposes, including owning of property, was a very complicated matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Unlike <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where if you had Jewish blood, end of it; if you were the product of a mixed marriage, and were Christian, you were considered Christian for purposes of owning property.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Okay.</span><span class="sentence" id="679">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And you could continue owning property. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Now, there might be difficulties and so on, but you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">My mother’s father was born of a Catholic mother, who died when he was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Right, in childbirth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  At that point, he converted to Catholicism, with the help of a Dominican who was very anti-fascist —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So as an 0 — as a grown man, he converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  As a grown man in 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  With the help of a man who was a very important Dominican, fiercely anti- fascist, fought with the partisans later. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">His name was Patrick Azatti(ph), I knew him, I met him after the war, he was a great man. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">He cou — my grandfather converted, and told everybody in his family, all the Finzi-Contini and their relatives, to convert. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Because if he converted, he was a Christian, for purposes of the racial laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He then married in this ancient, ancient Jewish family, but that was a mixed marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So their children, if they were Catholic, were also Christian in terms of being able to own property. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So all of these people in my mother’s family, were able to own property.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  Did they all convert after he did?July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  They all converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Some converted and it took, and they remained Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Some converted and it didn’t, because they were just converting for v — purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  My grandfather actually, because of this memory of his mother whom he never knew, I think actually converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">He died in 1941, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Of natural causes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Of natural causes, of cancer, and — and so, you know, it was in — but that meant that the properties remained in our names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  Mother’s — yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  In that side of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">In my father’s side of the family, the Calabresi, there was my father and my two aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">My mother — or, none of whom — my two aunts were not married. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">My father was married to my mother, and it’s at that point, only at that point that my brother and I are baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And if I think about it, we were baptized because my mother thought it was a good idea at that point, and my father couldn’t be, but partly because my grandfather was saying, this way they will be able to own property. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Because again, half, half, half, half —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  — but it continues to go all the way through. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">On the <span class="REGION">Minerbi side</span> , it happened that my great-uncle had two sons, and two daughters.</span><span class="sentence" id="710">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So Pepe(ph) —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My — Beppe, his older brother Julio, oldest daughter Ginevra, and youngest daughter Fernanda. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Beppe and Julio each had married Catholic women. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Fernanda, the youngest, had married my mother’s brother, who through this series of tricks, was also Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Now, their granddaughter, one of them — two of them have converted back to Judaism, and so — so it — it’s all —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It gets confusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  It gets confusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Ginevra had no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Great-uncle, who owned all these <span class="REGION">lands</span> and properties, gives them all to his grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Why to his grandchildren? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Because they nominally could be Christian, for purposes of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Now, in fact, there were any number of pressures, and things a-and of course, none of this matters after 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  When the Germans come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">But it was a situation in which it looked as though, if you wanted to, and were rich enough, you could survive, despite these horrible racial laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Survive and still keep some of your assets.</span><span class="sentence" id="725">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Keep your assets, be able to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">My father couldn’t, and his sister, who would, even if they converted would do no good, because of course, racially, they didn’t have a Catholic ancestors, but anyway, they wouldn’t, because they didn’t want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Couldn’t teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Couldn’t be — so it — there were all sorts of restrictions, and they were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">On the other hand, my mother’s parents thought we’d be able — what a — who knows how long this will last? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Administrations come and go, and in the meantime, we’re able to continue to hold our <span class="REGION">properties</span> , and do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So they didn’t want us to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  It lends logic to their point of view.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  The circumstance, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">ANSWER:  — and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So those are a couple of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">The others survived, as I say, in wonderful, mixed ways, and I —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You know, when you’re — this kind of outcome, there are lots of questions, and I understand you’ve got a book that is in the — in the working, and I, you know, it’s whetting my appetite for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">But the stories that you are saying, and the summary that you are giving, spell a kind of experience that too many other people did not have in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  That is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And one of the reasons I want to write this, is because what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> — and again, now some people, including some c-cousin of mine, are writing about the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> who did betray, who did behave badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">But more people were saved in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , than in any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , with a possible exception of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> it was the official policy of the king, and people just followed it wonderfully, and people were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">In <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , what was interesting about it was that it was against the policy of the government, and yet people behaved in ways which saved people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Now, a fair number of people were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">About 10,000 people were taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , right after <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> surrendered,July 27, 2017 because the Roman Jewish community was — there was an old community around the old <span class="BUILDING">Italian temple</span> , of people who were relatively poor, and still living there, as against all these assimilated people all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">They too didn’t think that anything was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And the Germans moved in, and took any number of them, a few days, right after. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And it’s that that gave the signal, and everybody else went hid, afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So it immediately, a fair number. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So if you look a fair number of people were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">After that, very, very few people were taken, because Italians hid people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">That’s part of the story of this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I mean, sometimes, just humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Sometimes — and you know, sometimes the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> hid people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">The cardinal archbishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> was maybe the only man to vote against Pius the 12" [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">He was much loved by people, and they tell the story, which I repeat in the book, but it isn’t my story, but — but he told all the <span class="BUILDING">monasteries</span> and nunneries to hide people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And that some people were being hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">nunnery</span> , which had been a closed <span class="BUILDING">nunnery</span> , and there were men who were being hidden, and —and young men and young nuns, and inevitably people started making love, and the Mother Superior is said, according to the story, that is very popular with Florentines, goes to the cardinal and says, terrible sins are being committed here, we cannot have this going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And the cardinal says, Mother, what do you think isJuly 27, 2017 worse? </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">What is happening there, or to turn people out to be killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Don’t worry about it, 1t?s on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">QUESTION:  It’s a lovely story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">ANSWER:  Which is a lovely story, I mean —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  — you know, this is a story that is told there, and there are squares named after this guy, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So, yeah, you know, sometimes, as I say, it was just humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And there are people who — Italian peasants who hid Jews, partisans, anti-fascists, and then, when the war turned around, and Germans were running away, hid them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">They were all people in trouble, one said to me, when they came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">E tutti figli de mama, they were all some mother’s child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">We struggled for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  Simple, but very profound.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  And it’s a— you know, a very — there was something about that culture — and I don’t mean there weren’t people who didn’t, but there was something about that culture that caused people to save people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And by the way, it is the reason why almost all Italian Jews who fled, went back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  You anticipated my next question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  We did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And a few others did not, but most people did go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , in a way that people did not go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , for sure, or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or other July 27, 2017 countries, because the feeling that after all, that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> has — and by the way, if you said — you know, somebody could say there were so few Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and they were so assimilated, and so on — that was true in many other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> as well, but — but there are some figures that give the lie to that, because it’s said that about 10,000 Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , from the —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">ANSWER:  Who had been protected when it was Italian territory, and was a whole thing of Germans trying to find out whether these people were really Italians, or from someplace else, or something, but who were not at all Italian, they were — when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> surrendered, fled into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> <span class="REGION">Italian territory</span> , and was a whole thing of Germans trying to find out whether these people were really Italians, or from someplace else, or something, but who were not at all Italian, they were — when Italy surrendered, fled into Italy from Croatia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And it’s said that of these 10,000 people who fled, who were completely unassimilated, only eight people were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So it — people were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And it’s — it’s something about — and who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I mean, you know, that’s one of the reasons I’m writing this book, because each of us, in our lives, faces situations where we may be called on to do things, and there are always excuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And these people were risking their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">QUESTION:  I was thinking of this question as you were speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Or shall I put it — this is half a question, half a comment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I’ve interviewed people who are — I’ve interviewed people who are Jewish survivors from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , for example, that you just mentioned, or from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">But I want to speak — stick with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , July 27, 2017 whose families might have been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , for two, three hundred years, maybe more, but they can trace back that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And sometimes when I’ve met them, they speak English with a German accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Some of them still speak very good German, you know, it’s their first language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And I will sometimes ask the question, so what part of you is German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And it’s very hard to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1146">QUESTION:  Very, very hard to answer, because there was such a profound rejection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1147">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1148">QUESTION:  And the rejection was not just state edicts, it went through society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But it also prevented someone who was the target of these edicts, and laws, and discrimination, from taking that which had been part of them, and being able to incorporate it, and keep it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">QUESTION:  And as you’re speaking, you know, to ask you what part of you 1s Italian —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  A hundred percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I mean, you know, my — I’m a hundred percent Italian, I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I’m a hundred percent American, because I have become American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And I have stories about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">When I was talking to some students from foreign countries, who were here on a program, and a kid from <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span> who had grown up in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> , who were here on a program, and a kid from Pakistan who had grown up in — in Denmark, actually, said, you know, that’s all very well, but which areJuly 27, 2017 you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And I said, I’m both. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And then he said something kind of fun, he said, okay, but whom do your root for when there’s a World Cup in soccer? </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And I —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  When the rubber meets the <span class="DLF">road</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">My answer was automatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Of course I root for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">But if it were a world cup in baseball, I’d root for reuta — <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And it’s not that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is better in one than in the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">In the last World Cup, United States was good and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was good and Italy was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">It’s just that I associate one with <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and so then I’m Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And I associate the other one with <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and so of course, I’m a Yankee fan, of baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And that’s the way that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And I am in that sense, why didn’t we go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And that’s an interesting story in itself, which has to do in a way, with what’s happened later, but think of it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Comes late 40s, 50s, my parents go back and see, and are undecided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">My father probably is leaning towards going back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  He who wanted to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  He who wanted to leave, but you know, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">My mother may be more likely to want to stay here, oddly, because my father had been able — his family, his sister and his mother, after the war, had joined us here, or were going to join us if we — but he thinks in terms of going back, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">He is having a career here, but yeah, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">My mother, oddly in some ways, because it is easier for a woman,July 27, 2017 strangely, to have a career in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> than here — she couldn’t get appointed to the Yale faculty, though they tried, because women were not teaching at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">But she thinks if she goes back, people will not take her career seriously, because she is too much this elegant lady, you know, and that — but they’re uncertain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So the thing falls, in many ways, on my brother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And my brother and I, separately, first he goes back, because he’s older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Then a couple of years later, I go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And we both have the same reaction, that 1t would be horrible to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and be poor, because this is after the war, and everything is still — but to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and be who we were, with all the losses, because <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were hit, things were not looked after, properties had to be put in other names [indecipherable] the Calabresi things to survive, because they didn’t fit to that category, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">So we were not as rich, by any means, as we were before, but we're still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But to go back and be wealthy, was something that we were too American, too egalitarian to conceive of doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  It made you that, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  We had become outsiders, coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and to be insiders, as we would have been there, was something that my brother and I, both instinctively, could not take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I will tell you my own experience in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I go with the chauffeur who saved Alberto M, who was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">He drives me around to see the <span class="REGION">family lands</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="1189">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is in the early 50s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1190">ANSWER:  1951. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I should have gone in ’50, didn’t go because of the breakout of the Korean war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Drive around in the ancient family Lancia, which still exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">He’s driving, I’m sitting in what would be the driver’s seat, because snobbery among Italians, you have the driver on the <span class="REGION">English side</span> , to copy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English cars</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">driver’s seat</span> , because snobbery among Italians, you have the driver on the English side, to copy English cars, although you’re driving — so, madness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">So I’m there, you know, thinking I’m driving, as we go sweeping down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">A little religious procession comes along, and they see the family Lancia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They all pull to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and bow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I’m a teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Who are these people bowing to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">We go by a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I say, that’s a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and — little tiny <span class="BUILDING">church</span> — and the chauffeur says yes, you own it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Well, your cousin owns it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And the bell is even more beautiful, and of course, it’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferrara</span> because it’s too beautiful to leave out here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I can’t take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So we say to my parents, we want to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And that’s what makes the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">QUESTION:  Amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">ANSWER:  We stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Because they were undecided, I mean, they really, essentially, left it up to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">The irony of this, of course, is that we did not see the great inequalities in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Remember, blacks were not visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It’s before 1953, before Brown vs Board of Education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">All the inequalities of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> are kind of hidden to kids just growing up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">In the meantime —July 27, 2017</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But it’s just over the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">ANSWER:  Just over the horizon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">In the meantime, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , 1950, partly due to my great- uncle going to the cabinet and becoming Minister of the Treasury [indecipherable] the great Italian miracle of the 50s and 60s, which changes <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> into an almost totally middle class society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Today, all these <span class="REGION">land</span> are owned by farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> is a little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> owned by there, the bell is back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">We own nothing of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">We’re still well-off, but not the kind of feudal thing — in many ways, by 1970, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> is a much more egalitarian society than is the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">In some ways not, less mobility, but in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">So that the irony of our decision was that we were moved by very good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Whether it the right one or not —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Or whether it was, in the end, what eventually happened —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1222">QUESTION:  — in reality or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">You know, it was —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">QUESTION:  Okay.</span><span class="sentence" id="1229">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That the result of that is that my brother marries a woman who was a classmate of mine in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , of an old, old, old New Haven family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I marry Anne, whose ancestors were the first governor of the first — and Eli Yale’s grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">The founders of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , and are wonderful, wonderful people, whom we would not have married, if we’d gone back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And if — our bridal rehearsal luncheon that my parents gave, my father gets up and shocks everybody by giving a toast to Benito Mussolini, because if it were not for him, and all his evil, Paul would not have married Celia, and Guido would not be marrying Anne.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">QUESTION:  Yes, and as outsiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  Because that’s another important point of our coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and what that meant.</span><span class="sentence" id="1241">July 27, 2017</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1244">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">First, let me just say one thing, because I want it on the record yet again, I do this, somebody said that we came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I don’t know where they got that idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  They made it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">They assumed it, and it sounds nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">I wish I’d come through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">It was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">We did not come through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">You went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> if you came steerage.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1261">QUESTION:  Oh, wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">ANSWER:  I picked the day because I wanted to say something about what <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had done for me, and what it hadn't done for others, and those who had helped us, and those who had not, and to dedicate myself to do things for those whom <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had not helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And David Souter, who 1s an old, old friend, cause we were on Rhodes Scholarship selection committee before anybody knew who he was, who swore me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">This old, New Hampshire Yankee was in tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">So, we land, and what do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Well, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , my father had — Mother had sent a telegram to a distant cousin, who was the only relative that we had here, who had been sent by the fascists to study law at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkeley</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">QUESTION:  Now, was he a fascist, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1268">ANSWER:  No, he was just a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">The reason he had been sent there was that the fascists had sent a variety of people who were tall and good looking, because they didn’t want Americans to think of Italians as being short, squat southerners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So they sent this very elegant — and as he said, shortly after he got here, they decided I wasn’t Italian, because I was Jewish.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1559">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">Understand that this was a <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> that at this time had never had either a Catholic or a Jewish full professor in <span class="BUILDING">Yale college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">It wasn’t until 1946 that <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> had a Catholic or full professor — or Jewish full professor in <span class="BUILDING">Yale college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1562"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> wasn’t much before that, it was when Conant became president, which is one of the reasons <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> got so far ahead of <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , because Conant became president before the war, and so all the refugees could go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">Schumpeter, the great economist, wanted to come to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , but couldn’t, had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">HeJuly 27, 2017 had many friends among the economists at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , but this was <span class="BUILDING">Yale college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">The law school was different, and had been different forever —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  At <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> was different, and had been different forever —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  At Yale.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1566">ANSWER:  — to its glory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">At <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">It had a Jewish full professors, Catholic professors, Catholic acting dean, in the 19" century admitted women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">The <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> was always the troublemaker, which is why I love it, and always different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">The <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , slightly different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">The dean of the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , Winternitz, was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">Some said very anti-Semitic, but he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">There were some Jews on the faculty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">Still an enormous quota, I mean, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">The first person in the class was always Jewish, because to be Jewish, to be admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , you had to be — but — but at least it was mildly open, but — but just barely, in the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">And apart from the dean, I don’t know that there were any full professors who were Jewish, but anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1577">QUESTION:  Is this where your father was attached?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1578">ANSWER:  This was where my father was attached, the fellowship was to the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">The person he was working with, Arthur Geiger, who was in cardiology, was Jewish, was not a full professor, was an associate professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">But — so it’s not surprising that this letter, that a previous president of <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , who had just left a few years before, James Rowland Angell, was a fascist and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">I mean, he actually July 27, 2017 wrote a letter saying, if there could be something like what happened to the Armenians in New Haven and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bridgeport</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> and Bridgeport, we might be able to save our Nordic heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">This was not uncommon, with Lowell at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , and Butler at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">You know, it was the way people thought at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">So I say, the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> was different, we had nothing to do with the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , was slightly different, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">That’s where my father, because a fellowship had — money had been given to them, and maybe the Dazien(ph) foundation was doing this because they wanted to open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">Who knows why they gave it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">But — so, we arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">And the real estate agent comes to try to find us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to rent, a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to rent, and immediately shows us places on Worcester square, which was where the Italians lived, or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westville</span> , where the Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">And we get shown <span class="NPIP">places</span> there, and the people from the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> kind of sweep in, and say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">What they essentially said, you are ethnically Yale.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1591">QUESTION:  There’s a new ethnicity, it’s called <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1592">ANSWER:  It wasn’t ethnic, I mean, you live between Whitney Avenue and Orange Street, between the <span class="DLF">park</span> <span class="DLF">Whitney Avenue</span> and <span class="DLF">Orange Street</span> , between the park and <span class="DLF">Edward Street</span> , because that’s where all the fellows, assistant professors, young Yale faculty live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And so they found us a nice little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , still there, in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">An <span class="REGION">area</span> , by the way, which is still today full of Yale fellows, assistant professors and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">Now, ethnically of every ethnicity, but still remainsJuly 27, 2017 the <span class="NPIP">place</span> — the full professors lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in bigger <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , or here or there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">But that was the <span class="REGION">area</span> where young faculty members lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">Which 1s perfectly fine [indecipherable] they said, you know, this is what you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">Now imagine we arrive there, everybody who is there, is a WASP. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">We have in common with them that they are faculty and academic, but ethnically, culturally, extraordinarily little.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  And, if you look then to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , we had almost nothing to do with people who were wonderful, mainly Ashkenazim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">Couldn’t believe that we were Jewish, that my father, particularly the — he took, when he would see them, the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and so on, as patients, to speaking to them in German, because then they thought, oh then maybe this person sp — speaks an odd dialect of Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">To convince them that actually — you know, because — and the Italian community, almost all southern; very, very poor.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1653">QUESTION:  — of someone who was somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1654">ANSWER:  And now —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  They’re nobody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1655">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">And — and there’s some funny things about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">When my brother married Celia, who as I say, was my classmate in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , because I won a fellow — a scholarship to a little <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> here, and she was in that class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">My then college roommate, who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , and so on, said, oh, I am so — my parents are so glad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">And I said, why would they care? </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">I mean, what they — and he said, because people ask them who your roommate is at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and — we had three roommates — and I — and I tell them, somebody named Guido Calabresi, and my parents’ friends, business types, said, who are they? </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">And now my parents can say, oh, he is married to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">So, to them, this was a way of saying, there is now —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So now you’re somebody.</span><span class="sentence" id="1663">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  He’s somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">And now, I don’t know the extent to which both my brother and I — and maybe my parents, but my brother and I, have wanted, unconsciously to rebuild here, what we had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">Somebody has seen the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where I live, which is very beautiful, which we got —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Here, in — in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1666">ANSWER:  — somewhere here, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodbridge</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">And — and it’s a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">We got it for almost nothing when we were first married, but it was — it’s a huge number — amount of <span class="REGION">land</span> , and an 18" century <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and it’s been made — we’ve worked at it, and it’s really beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">And somebody who was studying at the law school, who 1s a writer, wrote a book in which he said, this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which looks like a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuscany</span> <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , who 1s a writer, wrote a book in which he said, this house, which looks like a villa in Tuscany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">And I said to him, you’re right and you’re wrong, it’s not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuscany</span> , and it’s outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">But it’s, in a way it’s rebuilding my grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> outside there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">So there is some side of people like me, who must rebuild and reestablish, so that now, you know, I’m an outsider in some ways, and yet, people know me and our children and — and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you still feel an outsider?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1673">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">And in some ways, I really still am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">It’s a funny business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">I teach a course with a judge on our <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , who is a good friend, who was chief judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">He’s younger than I am, and I teach a seminar with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">His name is John Walker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">He is H.W. 113July 27, 2017 Bush’s first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">And he is as much an insider as you can imagine in that — some ways in his legal career and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">And — and says that every once in a while I do things which puzzle this guy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1682">QUESTION:  He says that to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1683">ANSWER:  No, I mean Anne, my wife —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Oh, your Anne, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1684">ANSWER:  — says that, and it’s clear that they puzzle him, because they are not what a Yankee American would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">He’s come to see us in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and when he’s come to see us, he now understands far more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">When he, every once in a while, he does act — he’s a nice man, a friend, but he does act as if who — what is this guy doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">And at that point my wife, who is even more old, old, old, old Yankee than he 1s, kind of looks at him, to say, you keep your <span class="NPIP">place</span> , youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">But it is — it is there, and I think it is one of the things that has made me both useful and successful and open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1689">QUESTION:  So the kind of outsider that you’re mentioning, it’s — it’s far more subtle than discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">It is —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, it’s a much deeper thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1691">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1692">ANSWER:  It’s a much deeper thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">I mean, discrimination, were there some? </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">Yes, of course, there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">And it’s kind of interesting to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">I got — we went to the publicJuly 27, 2017 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was right there, and it was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> which then, as now, primarily have broader things, but have many, many children of young Yale, because of where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">And — and the local Boy Scout troop is the same way, you know, all these things were this —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1698">ANSWER:  — little kind of Yale WASP centered thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">At some point, the Foote school, which was a wonderful private school, made really wonderful by the fact — by one fact of discrimination, that <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> <span class="BUILDING">Foote school</span> , which was a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , made really wonderful by the fact — by one fact of discrimination, that Yale had no women teachers, so that many of the teachers in this little <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> were the wives of professors, and immensely learned, and interesting and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">You know, you had a level of teachers that was fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">In seventh grade, I get a scholarship there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">My parents are uncertain about private schools, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> , because in Italy <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> were — but the fact that it was an all day, and anyway, the headmistress, who was English, and who was a wonderful lady, told them, this really is better level of education and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">Why did I get that fellowship — that scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">Affirmative action, but not because I was Jewish, not because I was Catholic, not because I was Italian, even though I probably was about the only person, maybe one or two others —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span><span class="sentence" id="1705">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">Was because I was a boy, and in seventh grade, enough boys went off to <span class="BUILDING">prep school</span> away, that they needed boys, and so they looked to this <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and here was this kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">Because, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , I went back to second grade, I was doing things back at the level, and clearly they —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1708">ANSWER:  — and so that’s why I got the scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">I was there, in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was all the really major professors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">A classmate of mine was Sally Griswold, the daughter of a guy who became president of <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and we became, you know, very close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">This was the whole entourage there, and lawyers, great lawyers, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">My wife was two years behind me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">And so, what happens? </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">In those days, when you get to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the mothers of daughters would have dances at Christmastime, at vacation time, to which proper, eligible people — boys — would be invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">It was just the way it was, you know, you — a-and they’d have dances in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">It’s kind of interesting, some invited me, and some did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">As it happened, my wife’s family invited me, because they were people who were not bigots, and they were friends of the guy who became president of <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and whose daughter was my friend, and of Gene Rostow, who became the first — not the first Jewish dean, but a Jewish dean of the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">And — you know, they knew, and they knew, in a way, who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">There were people who were very 116July 27, 2017 open, and people who were less so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">I can’t say I really noticed or cared, because our attitude, in a way, was very snobbish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1721">QUESTION:  Your own in turn —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1722">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">ANSWER:  Yeah, I mean, you know, we thought, we were who we were when you people were painting yourselves blue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1724">QUESTION:  Well, you know, there’s some truth to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1725">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1726">QUESTION:  And — and there’s also —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And — and so but, in a way, we were — an-and the fact that we didn’t belong, meant that we would be friends with everybody, but in some ways we also thought that we were outsiders because we were better than everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">Which isn’t nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">But it is part of, at the same time, a feeling that we had to achieve, because if anything happened to my father and mother, there we were, at least until after the war, and not immediately after the war, but when things started getting put back together again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1729">QUESTION:  I want to dwell on this a little bit before it’s — sort of like psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">In some ways also, I — I —I take your point where you’re saying that, you know, we thoughtJuly 27, 2017 we were a little bit better than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">You have a certainly illustrious family history, that can be very convincing to — to feed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">At the same time, when you’re in the position of an exile and a refugee —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And you feel both —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — too many other people didn’t have those reserves and suffered enormously, internally —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1733">QUESTION:  — because they didn’t have — they felt like they no longer mattered in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1734">ANSWER:  But it — it — and you know, the odd thing is, if you are that way, you — it really doesn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">I mean, we had a — my parents had a very, very hard time making it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">Ultimately they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">Ultimately my father became a full professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">Ultimately they were recognized in their <span class="DLF">fields</span> , but they had a very, very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">And I sometimes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because they were having a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">I don’t think that’s true, and my example of that is Hanna Gray, who became president — provost at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">Was a couple of years ahead of me, at this same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">Oh, by the way, this English headmistress was delighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was somebody who wanted that, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">When Hanna was provost, and we were friends, because of — they were at dinner — lunch at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> once, and I said — we July 27, 2017 were talking about the experience coming, and I said, but of course, 1t was very different for you, because her mother was Jewish, her father was a great German historian, whose <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> was paid for by the Rockefeller, had been given by the Rockefeller in 1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">Because his wife was Jewish, they decided to leave, and Rockefeller found — whether it was the Rockefellers or a foundation, said to American universities, whichever one of you wants [indecipherable] Hajo Holborn was his name, we will give the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> — move the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> <span class="BUILDING">American universities</span> , whichever one of you wants [indecipherable] Hajo Holborn was his name, we will give the chair — move the chair there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">And he wasn’t Jewish, so <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> was perfectly willing to have him an-and it was a great, great story, and so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> was here, and the — and so I said to Hanna, I expect your experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father was a full professor already, with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and that, so on, and — and she looked at me, and she said, you’re absolutely wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">And she described her feelings, and her family’s feelings of being outsiders, 1n exactly the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">Because it was that just this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">And this is — it’s odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">Bob Dahl, the great political scientist, wrote a book called “Who Governs?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">in which one of the things that he does, is talk about who are the social elite, the political elite, the financial elite, the academic elite in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , he defines these in good political scientist terms [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">Financial elite, anybody who is on the board of directors of any one of different <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="1753">July 27, 2017 Political elite, anybody who is [indecipherable] certain positions, selectman, or whatever, or selectmen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and — and things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">Fine — social elite, anybody who goes to what used to be the debutante ball in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , a big dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">And academic elite, anybody who’s full professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">Finds only one person who is all four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">Me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">The outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">Nice irony. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">Why all four? </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">Well, academic elite, easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">Political elite, at some point the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodbridge</span> wants to ask me to run as a — for selectman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">Democrats don’t win, but there is minority representation, you have to have a certain number of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">I’m not particularly interested, I’m saying I’m in Europe on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">There are Italian Americans living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodbridge</span> who always vote republic, because the Irish are democratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">They know an Italian name, vote for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">Why didn’t the democrats do that before? </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">Because if you do that, all the Yale people, and the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn’t vote for that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">For me, of course, they all vote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">Financial elite, they’re looking for somebody, two parts of a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> are fighting with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">They’ ve never had an Italian on the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">Compromise, let’s not fight, let’s put somebody who’s totally an outsider on the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">So I end up being a bank director, because I was a full professor, young and Italian, ever looking for a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">And social elite, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">All the people who get asked by girls who are coming 120July 27, 2017 out, to be their escorts, then get asked to this dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">And since my friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were the ones who were — so — and yet I’m an outsider in all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1778">QUESTION:  And you still feel that, that’s the key thing —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1779">QUESTION:  — is that you still feel that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1780">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">And when my son, our children were growing up, at some point I was saying to Massimo, our youngest, how his older sisters, who seem to be so successful, and this was this younger kid, and the first — the only guy with these two very powerful sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">And so I said to him, you know, they — that, you have insecurities, but realize that your sisters each have insecurities, and I started talking about their insecurities, and he understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">And then, being a bright little boy, he turned to me, and he said, and what are your insecurities, Daddy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And I immediately said, I’m a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">I’m a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">I’m an outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">And I — by the way, I say being a refugee is the most important part of my legal education, because it shows me what it means to be an outsider, which is very important if you’re gonna be a lawyer and a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">Say, I’m a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">And he immediately says, of course, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">And so is Uncle Paul, only he deals with it in a different way from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1791">QUESTION:  What a smart boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">121 July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1793">QUESTION:  How old was he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1794">ANSWER:  But he’s so — he must have been 13 — 12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1795">QUESTION:  But truly a smart — you know, very insightful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1796">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">But he saw when I said that, that of course, there are all sorts of things that I still feel <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and so did Paul, but that we dealt with it in different ways [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Well, you know, of all the things we’ve talked about, the identities; born Jewish, baptized, and now a practicing Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">Italian, refugee, outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">Which of them has predominance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1800">ANSWER:  Different ones at different times, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">In an odd way, I have both felt being outsider because of each of these —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1802">ANSWER:  — at different times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1803">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1804">ANSWER:  And also, I have used each of these. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">For instance, when I was dean, to reach out to different groups, because I saw my parents, though they had nothing directly in common, reaching out to help people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , help people in the Italian community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">My mother was a Knight of the Italian Republic after the war,July 27, 2017 for all she had done for Italian Americans here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">Reaching out to the academic community, reaching out to all of these, and giving to them of that, so that you feel both apart and <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but a duty to do something for [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">It helped, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">When I was dean, there were all sorts of people who are Italian Americans, who are Jews, who are this, who are that, who are the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">And they’d see a dean who was also that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1811">QUESTION:  And so they — like many black girls now say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1812">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1813">QUESTION:  And why Obama was so important to the black community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">If he can, so can I.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  There’s a — there’s a man, Iacobucci, who became a justice of the Canadian supreme court, dean of the law school at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> at Toronto, and acting president of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Toronto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">The first time I met him, he said to me, Guido, you don’t know how much you meant to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">I said, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">And he said, I was a young kid at the univer — at law school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in Toronto, and I came home one day, I loved law, and I said to my parents, I want to be a [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">And they said, you can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">And I said why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">And he — his parent said, because you’re an Italian and in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> — then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> is very different now, but then, you know, that can’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">I took out of my pocket, an article in the “New York Times,” how Guido Calabresi had become the youngest full professor of the history of a Yale law school, and twoJuly 27, 2017 or three youngest in the history of <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> <span class="BUILDING">Yale law school</span> , and twoJuly 27, 2017 or three youngest in the history of Yale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">I said, if that can happen to an Italian at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , it can happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">So, you are, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">If you know that all of these things can be of use to others, you then relish every one of these feelings of being a</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Of this identity, or that identity, or — what would you like us to understand about what it is to be a refugee? </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">That is both historical a question, and I think very currently a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1827">ANSWER:  The first thing is that every refugee is an outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">And that’s the fundamental thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">The second is that it has always been the case that there have been people who helped, and I can tell you, and when I was sworn in, I n-named them by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">Ziegler Sargent of the <span class="BUILDING">Sargent lock company</span> , who went out of his way to help these little Italian boys — became a — a very good friend of my parents, as a result. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">And there are people who stand in your way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">And — but if you worry about the people who stand in your way, you hurt yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">But if you instead are grateful for those who help, and then help others in your situation, that makes you something that makes this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">You —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  One — mm-hm? </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">One of the things that you said about what your parents had done, and I want to ask more questions about what some of their difficulties were, was that they engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Very often when a refugee will come to a for — very often, 124July 27, 2017 when a refugee will come to a <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span> , they feel so strange and so much and outsider, and so —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1838">ANSWER:  Okay, this is very important, and it’s a great piece of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">Because of this fellowship at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and because we were able to hang on and stay here, we were not part of the Italian refugee community that was centered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">We knew them, or some, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , a few different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , either of anti-fascists, or of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">We knew them, we were a part of them, we had been with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">We would see them from time to time, so that I went to call on the mother of the Rosselli brothers, who had been — who was living —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1843">ANSWER:  — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larchmonts(ph</span> ), because that, you know, we did, but — but we were not part of it, and so we did not close in, in the way such a community does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">You s — those people almost all went back, remained something to themselves, because it was much easier than dealing with this strange, American world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">Because we were here, and alone, we couldn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">I’ve seen that in other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">I have a law clerk, who is now dean of a law faculty at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> , named Eduardo Penalver, whose family fled <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">His father did not want to stay either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , or inJuly 27, 2017 <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> where the main Cuban — went to <span class="REGION">Washington State</span> , doctor — that family — these people are brilliant, wonderful, have done all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">They’re much more open, because they had to deal with the rest of the world, and weren’t able to look in on themselves, and on their troubles, and on their grievances, which are real. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">As we could have, had we been part of that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">So that was something which I don’t think my parents were especially aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">I think they understood afterwards, that they were doing things which might be hard, but that they were much more interesting than had they been part of that community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1853">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about how it was that your father was able to hang on after that unwelcome letter.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1873">QUESTION:  Oh my God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1874">ANSWER:  Because I’ve been 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know.</span><span class="sentence" id="1875">July 27, 2017</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1876">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">And I never tell my mother this, because she would have been upset, because she didn’t want to be — say something rude, but it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">Neither understood the other, and it was perfectly fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">So that’s how we are as insider outsiders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">My father is at the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , and has this extraordinarily dreadful accent, because of which it’s very hard to understand him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">He knows the language very well, and he is hanging on by his fingernails.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1882">QUESTION:  Oh, poor man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1883">ANSWER:  He is a great — he’s a great doctor as well as scientist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">He never writes the kinds of things here, and does the kind of research here that he was doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , which, you know, people said this was Nobel prize type of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">But never does that here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">But he comes to be loved by students because of what he does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">But he is certainly not — he’s at the fringes, and not appreciated in any way at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">My mother — oh, they decide that if you’re going to — if we’re going to stay here, it would be useful to have American degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">So my father, because of the chairman of public health, a wonderful man, c-a-o — C.O.A. Winslow, or something like that, liked him, saw that he was special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">And public health was kind of a hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">Says to my father, look, take a few courses, when you write an article about something and we’ ll work July 27, 2017 it out so you get a doctorate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">And so my father gets a doctorate in public health, with his left hand, thanks to this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">It’s only — remains only a hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">My mother instead, whose <span class="DLF">field</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was philosophy of art [indecipherable] is her dissertation, so decides to go to graduate school at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> at Yale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">She starts out teaching at what is now <span class="REGION">Southern Connecticut</span> , it was Teacher’s College at the time, to earn some money while we’re here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">She gets fired in 1941, when <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> goes in the war, because suddenly people decide — realize that you’re supposed to be a citizen to teach in a <span class="BUILDING">state college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">And everybody’s desperate, but there’s nothing to be done about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">And anyway, she goes and she teaches — she decides that she’s gonna get a degree in French, because a French — German-French department, Henri Peyre, was a brilliant, interesting scholar, and she’d always been interested in linguistics and literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">So she gets a doctorate in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">And — and that becomes her <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">The head of the French department wants her appointed to the Yale College faculty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">It is said, and I can’t prove it, that 1t goes all the way to the corporation, which says no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">We have no women teachers — no women students in the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , how can we have women teachers? </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">Logic on logic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">So she goes and teaches at <span class="BUILDING">Connecticut College</span> in New London, then Connecticut College for Women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">Interesting story about marriage and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">I say to my mother years later, when my mother says, you know, I’d wanted to do two things in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">ThreeJuly 27, 2017 things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">Teach, write and look after my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">Because I wasn’t in a <span class="BUILDING">research university</span> , I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">When she retired — actually, after the war, she — <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> is still closed to her, she moves from <span class="BUILDING">Connecticut College</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">Albertus Magnus</span> , a Catholic college here, because it’s right nearby, and it’s not as fancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">We don’t need it as a backup any more, but she continues to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">When she retires, she starts to write, and she writes — well, a book that she wrote in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">We found a letter from the head of the Ecole de France when she died suddenly in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , saying from now on Reynaud(ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">But I asked her why they didn’t both leave and go to a <span class="BUILDING">research university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">And I said, is it because in those days, women followed men? </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">And Papa was here, and he wanted to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">And she laughed and she said, oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">What happened was that when this happened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2002">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2003">ANSWER:  Why do you work hard? </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">And I s — I know I said, because I have to be able to be on my own if anything happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">And so that while my parents protected us enormously, I think both Paul and I knew that we had to rebuild because we had this — we were okay, but immensely fragile. </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">Because if anything had happened to them, it ha — and we saw, you know, also, other people who hadn't be — my father had been told by his father, it’s very nice you want to study medicine, but remember, you don’t really need to work for a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">Fortunately, my father ignored that, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Studied medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — studied medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">So when we came, there was something that he could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">My mother was a learned —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2011">ANSWER:  — person, and so could do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">There was another Italian-American- Jewish family that ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , the time that we were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">Oddly, because the younger sister of this man’s wife had gotten a fellowship to study at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , just a much younger person, and so these two ended up here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">He was of a family that was extremely wealthy insurance people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">And she was of good family, not great and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">She hadn't studied as much as my mother, she was not that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">And he was an insurance man, of a great business family. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">They came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">He worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">She got picked up by this wonderful headmistress of an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> to teach French, so that we all learned French from Madame [indecipherable] who is this Italian woman, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">And that was better enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">But in a way, people like Paul and me, saw how important it was, if you were not in a world that knew you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">And we didn’t even know of a world that knew us any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">We didn’t even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">This was the world that we knew, that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">And so it — that probably was something that drove us to — well, my parents never — never said that — you know, the fact of getting good grades and so on, was 136July 27, 2017 something that in my family was always — everybody always had, so that that was not an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">That was not —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It — another thought that I had as you’ve been certainly telling me the past of the Italian branch of the family, is when did you learn these things? </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">It must have been here, because you were six years old when you left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2029">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">I learned things here, some from my parents when — when I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">I happen to be a person who was always blessed with a great memory, and a very, sort of broad interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">So that when I went and met relatives there, I would talk to them about their history, I would hear about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">And all of these things sort of got learned, some here, some from my brother, who knew things in a somewhat different way than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">But more, I think just in talking to my parents, and in being interested in things in which, to some extent they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">They were much less interested in their ancestors, because to them it had come as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2036">QUESTION:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2037">ANSWER:  And somehow you were, you know — they were people for whom this whole ancient history was kind of — you know, a bother. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">For me it was something that was kind of interesting to know who I was, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2039">QUESTION:  Interesting way — well put, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">137 July 27, 2017</p>
<p>ANSWER:  You know, and — and so that — that became, and so I’d listened and I took these things in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">And by the way, that’s why I’m in a hurry, I’ve written a draft of this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">It’s an ugly draft, it’s not well, but I’m almost 85, and how long I’Il last I don’t know, and I wanted to get it down on paper so that if I don’t get it in shape, at least it’s there, because I’m the last one who knows these stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2043">QUESTION:  They’re important stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">They paint — they paint a world, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2045">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2046">QUESTION:  And they paint the individual destiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2047">ANSWER:  They paint a world of people who somehow thought that nothing could happen to them, found themselves in desperate danger, reacted to that in a variety of different ways, and then find that people, in a variety of different ways and of different means, saved them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2048">QUESTION:  That’s huge.</span></p>
