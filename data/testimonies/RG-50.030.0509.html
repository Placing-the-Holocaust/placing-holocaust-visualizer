<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  So, can you tell me a little bit about your parents, their names, and any siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Josephine, my father’s name was Berthold, my brother’s name was Ignatz. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He never used the name, he hated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  What name did he use?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  I -- he was called Bushy, that’s an Austrian expression, little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And so he never really used it, only on pape-- on documents and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  And tell me a little bit about the personalities of the members of your family, your father, your mother, your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Tell -- give me a little picture of each one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  They were -- how shall I say it? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In my -- in -- as -- as a child looking at them, just normal people, if [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I really ca -- 1-it’s very hard to say, you know, what -- because you’re looking at it as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">They’re just ple -- nice, normal people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  You know, a lot of siblings have naturally, you know, some kind of sibling rivalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Did you get along very well with your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] I was, you know, sibling rivalry, I would y -- tease him. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">If I really wanted to hurt him I called him by his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But that was about the extent of it, I mean, we didn’t -- one day he -- I locked him up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , an -- and he said he’s going to jump out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I said go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But that’s not -- so anyway, we -- you know, there was really not -- he was four years younger than I am, and -- so there was not this much rivalry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  And tell me more about your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Did they run a strict <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and also what kind of work did your father do and your mother, did she work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No, my mother didn’t, but my father was in the scrap metal and then he wheeled and dealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I ca -- really, it’s very interesting that I cannot really remember, because I was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Was a normal child, not interested in anything but myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And -- so it’s very difficult to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I can’t really remember, you know, that it wa -- that something really would have impressed me, or interest me. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">All I was interested is having -- you know, playing and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were your parents strict at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Yes, and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">You know, European parents, I mean, they would be going to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But no, they -- it -- just a normal family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My father -- when we lived in outs -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neunkirchen</span> , my father commuted from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> for awhile, and then we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So -- but it was a nor -- it was a normal, average life, we can compare the middle class life to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about whatever memories you have of this first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you were living in, where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  I remember playing with -- having a friend, which was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Then, of course, I had no clue whose -- all her brothers were in the par -- in the party, the Nazi party, had pictures up of Hitler and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And here she was my playmate. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I mean, we were four years old -- four or five years old, and I remember that, but otherwise -- and we were good friends, we’d -- she would come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I’d go to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And that -- you know, the parents never said you can’t play with her or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And -- but I do remember the pictures because you know, it was something different with the -- the emblem, the colors and whatever else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Was it something that made you uncomfortable in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  I couldn't really -- I mean, I noticed it, because you know, we knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> couldn’t be compared to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the Jews, though they were persecuted, they were not to that extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They still had a more or less, if you can call it normal life, existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And that’s all they really [indecipherable] five si -- four or five years per - no, five -- five, six maybe, and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So this is when you moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  No, it wasn’t that small a tow -- it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but really not. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You know, moved, adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was -- my parents -- I was taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And what are children interested in, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You make new friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And we had family living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , broth -- my father’s brother was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and I had a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, you know, the transition wasn’t that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">You are in the same <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you are speaking the same language, so it doesn’t -- didn’t make this -- there wasn’t this great an impact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Did you like living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  And that’s the day when you were at the movies, that you’re remembering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was -- it was in May, I don’t remember the date, but I know it was in May of "38.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Nobody -- nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Nobody had a concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I mean, nobody could unders -- you know, nobody knew that na -- I mean, they were -- the Austrians welcomed the invasion, what they call invasion, with open arms, and there was -- I's -- I presume now, looking back, there was a lot of poverty, there was a lot -- there wi -- you know, people that didn’t have -- there was no work, so- and the Austrians isn’t, by nature, are not very pri -- used to be -- not a very productive person. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">As long as they had three meals, or four meals, and didn’t have to extend themselves, that was their outlook in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And so here they felt, you know, they were -- they were going to get something, because what did Hitler do? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He took it from Peter, gave it to Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I mean, he took the businesses away, and so consequently the people suddenly became business owners, and started ye -- regardless if it had the ability or not, they started the middle class life, so to say, and were very happy with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So if we could go back a little bit to -- prior to the anschluss --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  -- just to get a little bit better picture of your home life.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  If you could give me just -- sort of set the scene and give like a physical description of your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as you recall it, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Well, we had a -- we had -- we had a -- two, three bedroom apartment in -- on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">third district</span> , and it’s very hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It was just a normal <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and a normal -- what you would call an American -- equal in to an American life. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Not -- not -- I -- I really don’t know how to describe it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Just a very normal life, which abruptly ended, and we got notice that we were going to be relocated, that’s what the -- would be call -- and we knew when, and we were lo- no, we were relocated in -- we -- into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we stayed there with another family and their daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It was really a <span class="BUILDING">storefront</span> , an apart -- and a -- and a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And my mother, father, my brother and I lived in the <span class="BUILDING">storefront</span> , and this other couple, who were very elderly and their daughter lived in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And this is how we started our new life, so to say, until we got notice that we’re going to be relocated, and at that point we all left. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And my father happened to have a friend who was not Jewish, and who was an illegal member of the party, and he send him a postcard, and he said, if you need me, call me, I’m there. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my father called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He -- he -- he became the director of the <span class="BUILDING">sanitarium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Do you know his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Yeah, his name was Kittel, K-1-t-t-e-l. And his wife was esn -- his wife’s name was Mia, he -- his was Leo. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And they -- I stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I was this -- I was the niece from the German speaking part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I stayed with them for many, many months and my father and mother found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and for awhile my brother was with them, and then he moved with -- to Mariani and her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Mariani is a friend of ours, was a friend of my father’s, and her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they ca -- when they had to vacate their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they were going to be relocated so to speak, they came to us and they stay -- they stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and every time the chimney sweep would come, they had to get up and come into the -- come into our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and stay with us, because he came in the back, or the front, whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And my br -- as I said, this is -- I’m mixing the whole thing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  So may -- so maybe we can get the chronology here. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So the first time you moved from your original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  That was something you did not because of a -- a relocation order, or was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Right, I -- I ca -- you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I really don’t remember how it came about that we had to vacate, and we sold our -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and everything was sold, and we moved into this <span class="BUILDING">storefront</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I don’t know how -- how the whole thing came to be, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And what age are you about, at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Iwas 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  And so what year is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] maybe I was -- I must have been older, about f-four -- maybe 14 -- 14 - 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  And was -- was this actually one of the first <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you were 1n hiding, or were you still living --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, no, we ju -- we still lived a so-called normal existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we were there until ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I think we moved there in °40 -- in °40, and we were there in °41, and then we were being re -- suppose -- relocated, and that’s when we went into hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  What did you know, if anything, about the relocation order? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Did you know anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  It -- 1t was all underground cr -- <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> , so to speak, you know, you -- you heard, you know, people found out, they told you that this and this <span class="DLF">street</span> will be next, so you were alerted to it by -- by people who knew, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So it sounds like even before you got the actual order --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, you went before, you know, you had to go before. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In fact, we had a superintendent who was very, very good to us, and Mariani and her husband stayed in her father’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and he gave them a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stay there, hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the woman, the daughter of the people who lived in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as we did, went there to sleep every night, she had -- she -- he let her sleep next to him in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I mean, when you think about it now, the situations were such, as I’m recounting them I can’t really believe it, because I’m telling it to you and I say, if people will listen to this, what will they think? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So -- and then of course, when we got notice to leave, you know, that we were being picked up, or rounded up, or S -- we -- we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And at one point we stayed, we -- we moved right in next <span class="DLF">door</span> with Mariani and her husband, and when they came for us we could hear them through the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , because they - they came in and, you know, they were looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And my brother had parakeets, h -- in the <span class="DLF">storefront window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And those birds -- you know, they came in and they made a lot of noise, of course, and those parakeets started to screech, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We could hear all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And of course they were they -- you know, they realized that we left, we left everything but what we really needed, and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And wi --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But you were just next door, and -- and somebody could have found you very easily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I mean they -- if they had no clue that we -- they would have never, ever thought that we would be -- there would be anybody next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So -- it was an adjacent <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so -- and then of course we had to leave because people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> wouldn’t -- knew us, and people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> knew us, so we really had to vacate and find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And then we just started traveling from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , whoever would take us, we would stay with, you know, whatever length of time we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Because you had to be very careful, because if you stayed -- the law over there wa -- was or is that when you are -- I think it was a week, you had to go to police, and report that you are living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So if anybody would have seen us, or -- or -- you know, for any length of time, that will be a tip off [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So, if I have this correctly, that’s really when you first went into hiding --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Hiding, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  -- and this is 1941, we think, and this is when you moved next door to the <span class="BUILDING">storefront</span> --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  -- that’s really the --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I mean, this is the -- we had no -- we had no -- we didn't know where we are going to be, and so this was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could be for the -- for the day or two, or I -- I can’t remember how long we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It wasn’t long because it was one of those very small <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and so we really didn't know how long we’re going to be there, or wa -- we were there, we just -- my father found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me, and my brother then went with Mariani. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I can’t remem -- you know, they just -- he -- she took him and I went to this friend of my father’s and I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I stayed there for many, many months, and then I changed to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and eventually ended up with Mariani when they -- when -- because every so often I would leave, and then a couple months later come back to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And that was really a -- you know, it was -- 1 -- you were never any length of time, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We had one very -- was a very weird thing, I don’t know how, when and where, I don’t remember that any more, but there was an SR man who took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">In fact, he took Mariani, her husband, me, my brother, and we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And he had -- he had a party, and the woman who was living -- the -- the daughter of the people who were living there, went and she was -- she served -- she served them. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And her name was Whittler, and she -- you know, she would walk in and she would say, heil Whittler. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You know, she would name her -- you -- she would say her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Nobody could understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And here she was, she was -- wore a little -- she was a huge person, and she was a little outfit -- you know, one of those serving things, a little [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I mean, those are the -- the funny -- the funny things, but we stayed there for a little while and his wife, for some reason -- she was British, and she resented it, and we had to move, and Mariani, my brother, and her husband moved and I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was the nursemaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  But this is the man who was part of the SA?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Yeah [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And how is it that he was willing to take you in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Yeah, he used to be -- when I stayed with this friend of my father and mother, he used to come and visit me, which was very welcome, because he would come in full uniform, you know, and he would walk -- come in -- he always came in through the back, through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , he would -- you know, so everybody could see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And they lived in a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and that was very welcome, you know, they -- they wanted him to come to see, you know, so --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Spiegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was a really, when you sp -- a really -- you would think it’s a Jewish name, but he wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Maybe he was and we didn’t know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Did you have certain favorite holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  All of them, because we always got new clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">That was a -- almost like a ritual. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Not that we didn’t have anything to wear before, but -- but the holidays we wer -- we always got new clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it took me awhile here not to buy anything new for the holidays.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Not -- how shall I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">After the anschluss is -- there was a teacher, she was really anti- Semitic and she would -- I can’t really reme -- I remember she made a remark about the Jews in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But I ca -- I wouldn’t be able to remem -- remi -- remember what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And no, anti-Semitism in -- in Europe was -- how shall I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It was there, you knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">If you really would ha -- if you wanted to be killed, you would tell them that Jesus is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I mean, that was the worst thing you could have ever done, and nobody would ever do that, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But you were always aware that you were Jewish, but for some reason, tha -- my attitude and my family’s attitude was, they’re ignorant people, and I’m abo -- we are above it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And that’s how you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I mean, it wasn’t as -- it -- anti-Semitism in Europe I think was more -- more open than here. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But whenever the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> becomes powerful, then -- then it does not lead to good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  What about one on one friendships? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Did you have mostly Jewish friends, also non-Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, we had non-Jewish friends, I had non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">My father most certainly had non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And they would say, you’d -- you -- you are not like the -- like other Jews, you’re a different Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I mean, that shows you their ignorance. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And of course we did not |- we didn’t look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">My mother had red hair, blue eyes, I had blue eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So, you know, we weren't -- we weren’t looked upon as -- as the -- the typical portrait Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But most -- I mean, most European Jews didn’t look what they were supposed to look, or what they wanted them to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So that’s really it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Were you in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and what kind of memories --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  I do -- I di -- I think the whole thing is overshadowed by the -- by the rest of the -- my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So, you know, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I know that I would ep -- bring matzo to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday and not write, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But otherwise, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every week with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Holidays, just like -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Loved to go to si -- I loved to go because it was Conservative and you had to be upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And for the holidays, as a kid, you could [indecipherable] downstairs and of course when there was [indecipherable] you were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and you went out to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And you know, it was really -- it is -- was the same type of life as a mi- as a middle class family you lived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I mean, there was really not that much difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So it’s very, you know, it’s very -- it -- it’s a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So you really don’t remember, or maybe you choose not to, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  What do you remember about any changes at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after the anschluss?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  When -- when did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  I think in -- well, there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from ’41 on, because we went in -- you know, there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from 1941 on. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So I basically had very little education. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">As I told my son once, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> <span class="BUILDING">university of life</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So that’s that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  And did you miss <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or you had so many other concerns by this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  You know, there was so -- there was so many other things going that going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> never really -- I don’t think it ent -- I can’t say it never, but I don’t think it ever entered my mind, because the -- you know, to survive was the most important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Now you, at this age clearly understood that -- that to survive, that -- that you are in a particularly challenging position as -- as a Jewish child to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Yeah, no the -- that you realized, I mean, you know, that you real -- you realized it and I didn’t because at -- we were, you know, at that time we were still able to move around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , though we wore the emblem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  When did you st -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">This is tape number one, side B. So we were doing a little bit of backtracking and -- and talking about after the anschluss, if -- if -- we were at the end of the other side of the tape, if you could just tell me again when approximately you think you started wearing the Jewish star, and also what other things started happening that seemed very different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Well, my mother was pulled out to go clean the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , scrub the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I was with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">My father had to go shovel snow, and at random th -- I think we started to wear the star in ’39, and of course when we were hiding we had to take it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And we -- you know, you mov -- at that time you were still able to move around with your star, you know, able to cre -- come and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Once you took it off you just had to be careful not to meet anybody who knew you, and maybe would alert them that you’re still around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Did you run into people you knew a lot anyway in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And how did people respond to you wearing the star, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  No, no, because we moved out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , and it was real sheer chance that you don’t meet somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You had to be very careful, and you had to be very alert, and it was a -- a very, very difficult, very -- very hard to relate, because basically, living here -- I mean being an American, or in any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , if you haven’t experienced it, it’s really not something one can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">As I always say, if I say my shoe hurts, until yours hurts, you don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You can’t really -- you know, you say, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But it’s very, very difficult because it was just a -- a -- something you can’t comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And you just do the best you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Do you think as a teenager you actually started f -- you know, feeling real fear? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">What -- what do you think you felt back then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Well, fear is -- was the thing which was always with you, or maybe caution. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I don’t know if you understand fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Fear is only when you are exposed to it, you know, when you face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But being -- you were always conscious and you always knew and you -- of course you were afraid that you are being found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So you don’t -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You don’t live with f -- I don’t think you live with fear, you live with the -- with the thought of hoping that it will -- 1t will be over soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Now during this time, first of all we see the -- I mean, what are the things that you’re seeing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Are you seeing Jewish stores, you know, things happening to <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , you know, things happening to stores and synagogues, and what do you remember about those sorts of incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were da -- you know, defaced, and they wrote Jew on it, and the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were being taken over by people tha -- you know, the party gave the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> to -- to everybody whom they thought was worthwhile being in the party, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And it -- it was just something you can’t -- y-you can’t really retell because that’s [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">store</span> things happen, and you took them -- that’s the way it was, okay you -- as long as you were -- the drive to survive was to be invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And th-that’s all you really could do to survive, especially when you were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I mean, if you walked around with the star, if somebody didn't like your face, they could do anything to you, whatever they wanted to, you were only a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So you were expandable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  What do you remember about Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Just hearing about it, because you weren't present. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But I remember as the story goes, my mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodz</span> , which is [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And they took the rabbi there, and they had him -- they held him over the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> which goes through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , with a [indecipherable] you know, 0-on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , they held him there, just to scare him, they didn’t throw him over. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I mean, you ni -- you’re not -- you -- you’re seeing something, you’re -- you’re hearing something which is really not -- which one can’t comprehend, because they weren't human. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It’s like today, we haven’t learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We really haven’t learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And do you think as a teenager you comprehended what was happening at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Not really, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Because I -- when I was a teenager, sometimes I did things you wouldn’t believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Like what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Like what? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I had -- I had a boyfriend who was -- who did not need to wear the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I didn’t wear it, I was already in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We’d go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we’d go like teenagers here, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">At that point I was 18 -- 17 -- 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We’d go to a -- we’d go to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , we go -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">One day I went to buy a birthday present for my mother, and I left in the morning and I came back in the late afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I remember like today, at that time they had umbrellas, and they had a cu -- they were regular umbrellas like the little ones now, they had a [indecipherable] and a -- was a lea -- it was all of leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">When I came in my father took it and ch-chased me. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Because, I mean, think. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">There was no phone, there was no way, but you know, you’re a teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">What -- what is - what is the problem, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You’re having a good time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Well, you were a little bit of an adventurer it sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  Well, I was a teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I was not -- I don’t think I was any different than teenagers today. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But- and you -- you don’t think what the consequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I mean, if they would have caught me, they would have caught my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I mean, a whole family, and an extended family would have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Never gave it a thought.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, you tr -- you know, you had to, because otherwise you couldn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">You cou- you know, you would -- you would just waste your -- your energy and strength, which I suppose you subconsciously realized that you shouldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Oh, I’m so far away from you, I’m SOITY.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  That’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">All right, so I wanted to know what you were hearing about people being deported at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">What -- what sort of --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- information did you have, if any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  We knew that there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and -- but we really didn’t know what it -- what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">My parents were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">My parents were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">How, when and where, I don’t know, but this friend I had who was Romanian, he did not have to wear a star, so he had more entry into <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and he found out that they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He was supposed to meet my father, and apparently didn’t, because they caught them, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and at one point you could send food to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">If they got it, we never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But we could go to different -- different <span class="REGION">districts</span> , and mail whatever we could spare or get together, and mail it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And then, of course, they stopped that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So I don’t know if they ever received it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  When you were still with your parents, and things were changing though, of course, after the anschluss, did you -- I know you’ ve talked about having an optimistic outlook --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  -- and hoping that things would change for the better soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Yeah, but my father -- my father felt this not going to -- this is not going to last, I mean, people would -- they -- because he had so many non-Jewish friends, he -- he never really understood either that it could last this long, or anybody could even contemplate anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you think you picked up your optimistic attitude from your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I mean, my father felt, you know, why emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And probably, when I think about it now, he was in his early 50’s, he had two young children, and a wife, and I -- probably was afraid, which is very possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And as I said, really not understanding the -- the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So, he -- we were going to -- I think 1t was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicorag</span> -- one of those <span class="REGION">South American countries</span> , and -- but it never materialized. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It was always on the edge, you know, we were going to go in two weeks, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And then it dissipated. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So we never really -- as I said, he -- it was not - he -- he just didn’t have his heart to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  What about your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="393">How did she react?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  You know, European wives are more -- we are going back 60 years, 70 years, so it’s, you know, whatever he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And Is -- I suppose she wasn’t as keen to -- to relocate either. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">You know, you heard -- and then, of course, it stopped, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="397"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> closed down, and -- I mean, th -- a lot of my -- my brother -- my father’s brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , okay, the one in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , they lived under false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They had Christian papers, and they came here, they were brought here by a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So, you know, not everybody -- the majority was bad, but there were some very good people in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So, you know, so people sa - peoples the -- the people survived, only could survive in account of people who helped them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  And I guess that would be in your case, people who were willing to hide you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Yeah, you know, and they -- I mean, they -- they put their -- they -- they didn't all do it for love. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">A lot of it was money, okay, but they really put themselves in danger at that -- if you were found, you know, if your -- if they found you, or if somebody denounced you, so it’s -- it was a very -- it was very, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Like, if somebody today would come to you and say, can you hide me? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So, you -- you know, it’s -- those people really put their own life at stake. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So -- right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  So just to ge -- continue with where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I know we talked about a number of different things and now I want to come back to the time when you were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So if you could just sort of summarize. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">When you started going into hiding -- also at that particular moment, what if anything do you remember about conversation -- conversations with your parents, you know, that you would see them frequently or try to, cause I know at this time you’re separating from your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We went into hiding I think the end of ’41, beginning of ’42, and I would see my parents, I would come to see them, they would come to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Would bring food which they purchased on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And we lived in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and we switched <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and really I -- I traveled a lot, I traveled into -- I was at many different <span class="NPIP">places</span> because I was young, and you know, people could not keep me for any length of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> I could go out, other <span class="NPIP">places</span> I could never leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">There was a place in the inner city, in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I stayed, and I was not be -- I wasn’t able to go out, and it was -- it was a big -- very, very big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with all very old antique <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">inner city</span> , in the old city where I stayed, and I was not be -- I wasn’t able to go out, and it was -- it was a big -- very, very big apartment with all very old antique furniture, and it was very scary to be there, especially when you were alone and they always said, if somebody ever comes in here, I’d be hiding behind one of those big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">You -- you think of the dumbest things. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you ever have any of those kind of close calls in any of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Yeah, one. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had one very [indecipherable] and with another ca -- in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But they were -- they did not have to wear a star at the time, and for whatever reason somebody came into their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , some official, and I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and I -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> , and I grabbed my robe, and I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I ran up the <span class="DLF">block</span> , and I knew a doctor there, so I went there, and -- and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I mean ga -- you know, you -- you go -- get into situations where you don’t think, you just -- especially when you’re -- you know, you’re running. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And you just take off and you don’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I mean, here I was running, if somebody would say, look, what she’s doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Somebody could have picked up on it, and -- and that was it, it was -- the ma -- it’s really -- the whole thing was more luck than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Whatever was supposed to be, that’s the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">But --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were you -- did it ever feel like an adventure? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I mean now, looking back, I see that you can smile over some of these anecdotes. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">At the time was it more frightening and you always had some --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, yes -- no, it wa -- it was serious, it was not -- 1t was not a game. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I mean, this much I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But at the -- at the point of danger, I w -- I wa -- suppose I was not old enough, or didn’t comprehend that the f -- that fear drove you to move, drove you to run, and that’s what I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Now, can you estimate how many, perhaps -- approximately how many different hiding places you -- you had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> you -- you had in Vienna?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  At least 10 or 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I -- you know, at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Because certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> I stayed for awhile, other <span class="NPIP">places</span> it wasn't convenient to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And you know, people were frightened, and so I moved from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And somebody -- you know, there was an underground communication, you know, somebody would say -- well, I know somebody who would -- you could stay with, because the people who did it knew somebody else, you know, their fre -- in their circle, so -- but it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And sometimes when I went -- I think I was the one who moved the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And -- being a girl, and being 17 - 18, so I was the -- really the one who moved the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Sometimes I would stay with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">They were -- I mean, luckily enough, they were always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And then somebody would find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I would go and that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Now, were the people who were hiding you always receiving some kind of money or compensation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  Yeah, they were -- yeah, most of them were -- were -- got -- got money, most of them -- my mother always brought food. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And -- but money wa -- there were a few where it was money, but most of them did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It was strictly doing it for the -- for the good of the people or whatever, or their conscience, or they -- or you know, you can’t -- you don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It was -- it was a tremendous undertaking for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  We had no -- we had really, absolutely -- I mean, n-no -- I -- I -- no -- how shall I -- we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">We just didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">The only thing we knew was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We didn’t know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we didn’t know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I mean, I had a very -- we had a very interesting thing happen to us in -- when I traveled with my husband, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> 1s right there, and my husband is a tourist, he speaks to everybody and speaking the language -- he spoke the -- the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was closed, so he wanted to know from the policeman why the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So he -- they were making a movie and the policeman said to him, have you gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And my husband said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So he told him how to get there, but among other things he also said he lived the ri -- the -- it’s -- it was a country road, okay, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> <span class="DLF">country road</span> , okay, and the trucks would go past there. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">There was -- you know, there was the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and there was <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And he said, you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would go by, we didn’t know that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, there were thi -- they were doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So that’s the mentality of the -- of -- we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I mean, we didn't want it, but we just waited for him, and we opened our arms when they arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">QUESTION:  So you find it hard to believe that they didn’t know that --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  From -- from a -- you know, I have a slanted -- I’m for -- that -- that I have a very sla -- because I’ve lived there, I -- yo-you know, I felt the anti-Semitism all my life, so consequently I- ’m -- I’m talking about the -- more or less, I’m not talking about the people of today, I can’t because I don’t know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">But they are probably better educated, and what 1s a -- a -- an Austrian? </span><span class="sentence" id="851"><span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was a mixture of Czechs, Poles, Yugoslavs, you know, I mean there’s no such a thing as a pure Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They all came from the so -- I mean, it was the great Austrian under the -- under the emperor. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So there’s no such a thing, so you have a mixture of -- of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And as I said, I’m -- I’m -- I was -- I’m prejudiced, I suppose, and I look at them totally different. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And so I can’t really -- I’m -- I can’t have a unprejudiced opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  So you had no idea what was about to happen --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  -- but then --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We went on the special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , we were only I think 15 or 16 people, and really was a -- a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train car</span> , and we knew there was something going on, but of course, nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Nobody could in -- nobody ever got out of there to tell, and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> knew, but they didn’t spread the word, so nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="859"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> knew where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So we were -- I mean, we know it did not bode well, but we really had to see what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We had to wait, we had no -- what were we going to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Describe the journey, how long and -- and when did you know?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  And it was a comfortable ride?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  Oh, it -- it was a regular third class coach, you know, we had -- we had the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> -- we had the whole -- we had the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I should say, not <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And I suppose we were guarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">That I can’t even remember, you know, we were -- because here we are, we didn’t know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I remember --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But -- but you felt it was ominous?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">In fact, there was one man, he was alone, and he asked -- he had some gold pieces, and he asked Mariani to sew it into his coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Not that it ever helped him, because he lost his coat, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You were with other Jewish prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  Yeah, we were about with 15 other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">We were with 15 other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">We -- and there was one -- there was one family who thought that they weren’t Jewish, the -- they converted, but they were with us, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And the mother died, and I think Mariani took care of the girl, and I think the father also survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I don’t know because I left -- I was lucky enough to be shipped out, so I wasn't there when Ausch -- wh-when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  So you’re on this journey, it’s not a very long one, but when do you first know that you’re arriving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Well, we arrived, and we were sele -- you know, there was selection, the separation of men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And in hindsight, of course, we -- after we were -- we -- after you -- the -- we talked to inmates, we found out what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Before that you had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">We didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And Mariani’s husband was sent to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , my brother went in the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and Mariani and I are- were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And we were together for a whi -- for a -- in fact, I wanted my brother to go with Mariani’s husband and they pushed him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">He went right into -- into selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And Mariani and I were in the <span class="DLF">block</span> together for maybe four weeks or so, four or five weeks, and then I worked that we -- I was sent to work in -- they tor -- I still don’t know what they did with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">You tor -- you tore the clothing into strips, braided them, and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Whatever they did with it, whatever they used it for, I never found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And then I worked -- I built a <span class="DLF">road</span> to the east, we were transporting rocks and breaking the rocks, and there we had a guard who would let us sit in the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> to take a re -- it was brutally hot, even in -- in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">No, th -- October -- no, was towards -- 1t was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And he would let us go in one by one and when the super -- the guy who was supervising, him came -- he came on a horse, so he could see him, so he would call whoever was in there out. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I mean, that was --</p>

<p>QUESTION:  That because of what you went through you feel more connected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1805">ANSWER:  No, I felt that the children should -- not I.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1822">QUESTION:  And I believe your husband was not a survivor, he was born in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1823">ANSWER:  No, he was born here, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1824">QUESTION:  And if you would just tell me, just briefly about your friendship with Marianne? </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">It has continued in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1826">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">I mean, at the moment if 1t wouldn’t be for us, she wouldn’t have anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">Because for some [indecipherable] whatever reason, she has a second cousin who has absolutely no interest or whatever, in her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">And it’s sad, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1830">QUESTION:  How long have the two of you been friends now?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1835">QUESTION:  And when you spend time with her, do you -- the two of you reminisce about this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1836">ANSWER:  We -- we can tal -- when we -- it is always that it is a miracle that we can -- we will -- we will always only pick the fun, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">I mean, we bo -- about sad, we don’t have anything to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">I mean, we laugh about things, okay, which happened, which come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">Sometimes they’re revelant to something and I will say, do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">So it is not -- maybe there’s something wrong with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1842">QUESTION:  Maybe that’s the way you’ve, you know, been strong and -- and held things together for so long, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1843">ANSWER:  I -- I -- I don’t know, I mean you can’t -- you can’t say it is because I was young, because Mariani was older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">And then you meet people who were -- who just can’t let go, for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">But life goes on.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  No, no the -- I mean, you know, I me -- I mean there were times I used to call her every single day when she was still -- when she was not -- when she could see it, and she was alone, so I would call her every single day, and talk to her, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">And here and there we would, you know, laugh about something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">I mean, she will tell -- she will tell you when she bought me my first high heeled shoes and I couldn't walk in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">So, you know, things like -- we had -- as I said, we will say, you know, it’s a miracle that ha -- all things said and done, you live a more or less normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">That’s -- whatever the norm is.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1874">ANSWER:  More or less, yes, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">Because there is a be -- you know, to look into the future, you worry today and tomorrow something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">I mean, it’s human nature, yes, we do worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">I’m not saying I’m not worried about certain things and drive myself crazy over nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">But most of the time you were -- you -- you tried not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">Even if my children say I’m neurotic.</span></p>
