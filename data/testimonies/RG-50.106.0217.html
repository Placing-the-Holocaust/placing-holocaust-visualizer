id="1159">Until much later on we found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Eric found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">My cousins, they were all in <span

me at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , said you don’t have to, her daughter was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , survived and but she was deathly ill.

go to a <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Until she got well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">So he was able to save her and her husband whom she met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">He was a roofer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">His name was Alexander Bernot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and he saw Anna scrounging around for some food and they got a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">He tried to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">He was a roofer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">He did most of the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> of the big, like St. Stephen’s and he was — and so the Nazis used him to fix the <span class="DLF">roof</span> here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">They didn’t care if the water dripped down on the inmates, but they wanted their <span class="DLF">roofs</span> to be free from rainwater and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So he did that so he had a little access to more things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And then the rumor came that the war 1s coming to an end and Americans or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British bombers</span> are going to bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">So the inmates said so now we’re going to, we survived this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Now we’re going to get killed by — he climbed up on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , with red paint. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And he painted red crosses on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">If he had been caught he would have been dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">But the thing was that some of these <span class="DLF">roofs</span> leaked and the red paint dripped on some of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They had no way to get rid of it and some of the Nazis saw them and they thought they had some kind of terrible disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">They ran.
