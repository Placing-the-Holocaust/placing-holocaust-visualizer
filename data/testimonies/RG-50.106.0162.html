<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My father was Dr. Hans Liebermann, an ear, nose, throat specialist who practiced medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> , and we had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> attached to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  And -- and your mother’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My mother was born Lotta Flora Olgala in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Opin</span> and married my fa -- September 24, 2003 was introduced to my father at a -- a fraternity dance when she was only 16 and they were married four years later in 1928, February 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  How far back can you trace your family 1-in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”
ANSWER:  Back to about 1650. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The family Olgala and Bloch were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lanendorf</span> , apparently having emigrated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> during various pogroms there and settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Opin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In fact, one of -- one of our foremothers married Michael Gratz, who eventually -- whose -- I think granddaughter became Rebecca Gratz in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my grandfather was very proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He made a family tree, which we have, which showed the family and that branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> did you live in, and was it a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of little bit over a hundred thousand people, with probably about a thousand Jews, primarily merchants, professional, and of course also others. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We lived, and as I said my father had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> with a connected <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I considered myself very middle class, in the respect that a- my mother had for the time a nursemaid for me who stayed almost until we left, and was active in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They had bil -- were quite active before 1935 also, in the general community, but that changed drastically with the coming of the Nazis, to be limited really, to Jewish activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="20"> ;September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  How religious was your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  My father came from an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox home</span> , my mother came from a barely religious home. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My grandfather was kosher, my parents did not keep a kosher home, except when my grandfather moved in after my grandmother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> from my father’s birthplace, which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boyton</span> , about 20 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">At that time we went to -- we had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> and my grandfather, even though he had a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , usually came to us for meals, really until we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Did you celebrate any holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I mean, we celebrated all holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I also remember -- rather my father was fairly observant in that I n -- I remember him taking me to the service for the first born, I think at six o’clock in the morning, I guess when I was about seven or eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I only have one memory of doing it, but that stays in my <span class="BUILDING">memory bank</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Any other holidays that you can talk about, that you have memories of as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Well, we always -- oh, by the way, our -- oh, we lived about one block from the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> -- rather, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I particularly always remembered -- sh -- oh --
QUESTION:  Are you thinking of a holiday, or --  ,September 24, 2003

QUESTION:  Rosh Hashanah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  The [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Su --
ANSWER:  Where the <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> , which was right next to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , always had a Sukkor and a had sweets for the kids, and that was of particular interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We al- also always had, obviously Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I remember the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The women sat in a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , but 1t wasn’t closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There was no curtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It also had music in terms of the boy’s choir, conducted -- and I still remember him, by Lira Fleischer, who is also the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> became closed in 1933, before I started, and the Jewish community had four <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> within the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where the instruction took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The main negative I remember, and this was after 1936, was we had to leave the <span class="DLF">school grounds</span> -- or not the <span class="DLF">school grounds</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> during lunch period. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And we more or less had to draw a fine line of being in the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> , between the boys and the girls which were separated, because there were fights and so forth and it became more and more dangerous to be in the 5September 24, 2003 schoolyard. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Toward 1937 - ’38, we were dismissed five minutes earlier so that we could be away from the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> by the time <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was open, so that we could get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> safely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">How did you feel about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Is it something that you would confide in your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Did you have any fears about this kind of situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">You were very young, of course, but what can you remember about that different treatment that you as a Jewish child got?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  I just realized I had to be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was given quite a bit of independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I was able to ride my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> wherever it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In fact, when the <span class="DLF">public swimming pools</span> were closed in 1936, at that time I was seven, there was an old <span class="DLF">rock quarry</span> which had water in it, kind of a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , which became the <span class="DLF">Jewish pool</span> probably about three, four miles out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And friends of mine and I used to regularly bicycle out there and as long as we weren’t in groups, we didn’t feel particularly vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  What about the teachers in your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Wa-a-a -- were any of them Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  They were all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">In other words, we had no contact with the regular school teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I remember my first gir -- first -- I went through first, second and third grades, and it was strictly -- it was a German curriculum, but we had our own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> within the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59"><span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> had been protected by a treaty covering 6September 24, 2003 minorities when parts of the <span class="REGION">area</span> were given to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and therefore, during the transition minorities were protected, the German minorities were protected in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and any other minorities were also protected in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So that the effects of the Nazi government really started in 1936 when Der Stiirmer was at every <span class="DLF">street corner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Der Sttiirmer was the anti-Semitic paper published by Goebbels and they had them behind glass for the public to read, virtually everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I also recall that in beginning of 1936, my parents insisted that I immediately take swimming lessons and be able to pass a swimming test of 20 minutes, because it may be necessary to take an ocean voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">When I was afraid of the test at the time, I remember my grandfather went with me and said, I’m not leaving until you do it, because the <span class="DLF">pool</span> 1s going to be closed very soon and I want you to be a competent swimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And that was bef -- before the summer of °36. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">During the time when the treaty was over, everybody was afraid of riots and there were some broken <span class="DLF">windows</span> and similar things. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My parents had the foresight to take a vacation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bornholm</span> , which is an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> in the n -- nor -- the <span class="REGION">Baltic Sea</span> , whi -- during these times, and when we returned the atmosphere changed pretty substantially. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">In other words, the so-called treaty expired and the community caught up with the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">7September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  Were you a very fearful child at this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Were -- how aware were you of the growing threat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  I was pretty aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I was never particularly fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I think I have very good nerves and that goes back to those days, I just learned to kind of mind my own business and do whatever I wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I had no real limitations except what I mentioned for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">In 1937, after my mother had taken a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in -- actually, I think late °35, and determined that a doctor had no chance of making a living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , my parents decided I’d better take English lessons and I remember I had an English teacher and I did this probably about once or twice a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  This was a private English teacher that came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  It was not a -- it was not taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  German. </span><span class="sentence" id="79"><span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> was strictly a <span class="REGION">German area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We did not -- people here were surprised that we did not speak any Yiddish, because Yiddish 1s really medieval German which combined with the local dialects. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And since the language of our <span class="REGION">area</span> was German, there was no -- it didn’t stay stagnant and didn’t get mixed with any other language, so that it wasn’t used.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Did you feel very German? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">8September 24, 2003
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In other words, the philosophy of my parents was that they were Germans, but happened to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Like we’re Americans, but religiously we’re Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Did you feel very Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">In other words, except that I did go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and after 1936, we couldn’t go to movies or other children’s activities, and it -- were restricted to certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I remember among the safer <span class="BUILDING">playgrounds</span> was an organization which was the non-zia -- the co-community was pretty much divided between Zionists and non-Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The non-Zionits-nists being called the Schild, or Shield Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And there was an old -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> pretty close to the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which served as our <span class="DLF">playground</span> , and that was a nice place to meet and of course, at that point we only played with Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My parents also shared what was called a <span class="BUILDING">Schrebergarten</span> , which is a piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> set aside a little bit at the ed -- kind of at the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , into <span class="DLF">garden plots</span> , where we had fruit trees and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It was shared by about 10 families. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And that was a place where we could safely congregate and that was actually a private parcel, which was our other <span class="DLF">playground</span> in summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In winter the <span class="BUILDING">Schild building</span> was a place where we could go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> really was just for worshipping. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There was no <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  So did you get religious training at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">9September 24, 2003
ANSWER:  Wi -- a -- a little bit of Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Not very much because I was -- it was too early to prepare for Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I was nine years old when I left, and --
QUESTION:  Wh-When you played with your friends -- and I -- I realize you’re quite young at the time, did you talk about the difficult times with them, or were you just children that played regular childhood games?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  We did pretty much -- we knew what -- what our limitations were, but within that -- I don’t think I was, as I said, particularly either worried, scared in an everyday way and we just continued to do what was pretty much what we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But there were limitations of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We knew what not to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  You had mentioned that you learned how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Were there any other sports that you got involved in as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Oh, everybody played kind of sandlot soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That was probably the main game. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That was about the only one because anything that would be more formal was really prohibited because you couldn't go to <span class="DLF">parks</span> , you couldn’t go to <span class="NPIP">places</span> where that existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  So you did not have any contact with non-Jewish peers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Very, very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  What about the non-Jewish neighbors of yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Just no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We minded our business and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">10September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  Were any of them pleasant to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  I don’t really remember any contact with neighbors because living in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , we were in the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Therefore -- the f -- no, wait a mo -- fir -- it was actually the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> is what the Europeans call the f -- one flight up. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I didn’t pass anybody except when I went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So we had the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> plus an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">office</span> , so that I’d have people over, we stopped using the playground area in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , because was considered a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But there were enough things to do that I didn’t consider myself deprived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did you have a lot of toys and games, and did you read books?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I had -- I felt I had just about everything that -- I wasn’t missing anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What were your favorite games to play?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Probably <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I had my -- I had model <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from as long as I can remember, and in fact, when we were ready to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my grandfather gave me two presents. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">One was an HO gauge, which was new at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That was the small gauge model <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which could be set up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , that in case we were in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , 1t would fit on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The other thing I got was a golden watch for my Bar Mitzvah when I would have it, wherever we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">11September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  Did you have any or -- or -- brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My mother had a couple of miscarriages and I was an only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Le -- I -- again, I realize you were very young at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Were you -- do you have any memories, being a four year old, of the boycott, or any stories about the a- the April 1‘, 1933 boycott. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Family stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  We were not affected by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">In other words, due to the treaty, what the boycott was in the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , 1936 was in -- was when it hit <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  As far as memories is concerned, the only thing I -- I do remember my father’s parents had a small <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> , again on the main square, and I remember their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was above the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I realize they did not have -- they only had one <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with running water, and for washing they still took a basin with a jug for the hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So this must have been around 1934, because my grandmother died of a stroke in 1935, after which my grandfather closed up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> to be near my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  So at the time, let’s say, of the Nuremburg rally in 1935, your parents didn’t talk about this with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  It was -- it didn’t affect us, therefore a lot of -- a-also, my father didn’t lose his hospital privileges until 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Many other physicians left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , for instance in 12September 24, 2003 1933 and 1934, because after the boycott, they saw the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It didn’t show up til much later in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , so that it also had the fact that fewer people really saw the urgency of leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  So when were the first restrictions, besides the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Mainly that we couldn't go into certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and that we more or less were given maps of what we could and what we couldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But it didn’t stop our movement, but rather, there are just certain things which one doesn’t do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Did --
ANSWER:  And we took it in that sense, that same as parents said you don’t -- you don’t cross the main <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Did you ever question any of this to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Just that as si -- that it wasn't safe and that there are en-enough things for me to do without it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  When did you see your first swastika?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Probably quite early, because it was on every stamp, it was on every government -- <span class="BUILDING">government building</span> , but it was taken as something that -- that existed, but didn’t have the same connotations --
QUESTION:  Same connotations of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  -- that we see now, of -- that it was a serious threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And, in fact, most people 13September 24, 2003 felt it would blow over and wouldn’t last, particularly my mother’s parents, who had celebrated the hundredth anniversary of a wholesale leather business with a tannery in 1933, and survived in very good shape through the hunger of World War I, when they could always barter leather for food at the local -- from the local farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And felt they were pretty much immune from anything that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">They really didn’t appreciate what ha -- what was going on until Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">This is tape number one, side B. When did you first hear about a man called Adolf Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Probably around 1935, because one did listen to speeches and the fact that he was able to arouse almost riotous reactions, and people started talking about what was going to happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Again, wa -- how political is a five year old, and I couldn’t really absorb what was going on in the same way as my parents, who obviously were quite concerned, as I said, whether it’s a ocean voyage, learning English and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">That became pretty clear even before the end of the treaty, 14September 24, 2003 and I’d say around 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">By the time I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was in 1935, it was already fully segregated and I just thought that’s the way it had to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Now, 1935 is when you said your mother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Were your parents already Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">No, it’s -- they were always su -- very supportive of Zionism, mainly as a refuge, and especially after the conclusion that a doctor couldn't make a living, they eliminated the thought of moving to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as one of the possibilities, pretty early.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  As things moved on, what about food? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Were your -- were you able to get enough food? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">No -- any problems with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  No, there were no problems with food except there were certain regulations, that on certain days -- I believe it was Friday or Thursdays, you had to do everything in one <span class="NPIP">part</span> in order to conserve fuel and I really don’t know if these were restricted -- restrictive laws for the Jewish community, or for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Oh, one other comment, which I think it interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> covered all degrees of religious activities, from what we would say very Orthodox to quite Reform. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And there was only one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">However, virtually all of the families bought from the kosher butcher, because he couldn’t make a living on only the 15September 24, 2003 people who were kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Consequently, we ate kosher food as a mitzvah for the rest of the community.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Did you have a family Friday night dinner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Yes, in fact for many years while my grandparents were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boyton</span> , we always went there for Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My father had bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in 1933, which was a major luxury at that time, was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convertible</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Something like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">VW convertible</span> , except smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And every Friday night we would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boyton</span> , which is -- as I said, it’s about 20 miles away, and be at my grandmother’s for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And one of the foods which I happened to have liked, which my kids could never understand, was a liver soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But she made a very good one.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  How did your parents feel about you learning those songs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  I don’t know what they knew or did anything else, but that was -- that’s also what you heard on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So that was almost pop culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I still remember quite a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Can you sing one or two <span class="DLF">lines</span> from some of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Like over <span class="DLF">hill</span> , over dale, what was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Just a second.

<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  First of all, my grandfather was a genealogist and when he -- when my father were thinking of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he looked up relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">There were a couple of other relatives who had left and he gave em -- as I said before, he traced the family back to pretty early times. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">During my father’s trip finally to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to try to find affidavits for the family and the affidavit being to guarantee that whoever comes over will not be on welfare, and would be supported for a year, he fou -- he sent my father to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> to check the grates records. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Unfortunately --

<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Your -- your father did not have difficulty getting passage and a -- and a visa to visit the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1938”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  He could pay for it with German marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The big problem was that you could only spend German money, you couldn’t take anything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And visitor’s visas were granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">That isn’t the same -- like you can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but God forbid you should live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">At that point there was also a brother-in-law of my erandfather’s father. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">No, wait a minute, it was a brother-in-law -- in-law of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Borrowed a substantial amount of money for a week and disappeared to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1935, almost causing -- causing a major business crisis, but they averted bankruptcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He found out that he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and had a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">In fact, he was vice president of Bendix aviation in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And my father got a vi -- an affidavit from him, on which we came over that July.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Did you talk about your life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with your American friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  In the beginning I was asked to talk a little bit, but my parents really -- I think after one or two, tried to reduce that because item number one, they didn't want to get into any subjects which were controversial. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Which was part of how we had been brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And any real f -- thoughts were only self-centered on what one should say and shouldn’t say. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  We were -- we had gone out that morning and I remember after lunch, I think my parents took a nap or went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , tur -- we turned on the radio, and all [tape break] again, we had a -- we had a radio in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and I guess it must have been about two o’clock that we heard the announcement, it was a state of disbelief. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And of course I still vividly remember the speech of a day that wi-will live in infamy. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And that of course almost totally prevented any further contact with the family, because the only mail that could go out was through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , or th - through <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , up to that tor -- while <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was ada -- rather, before December seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">After that, all communication except the Red Cross, stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">41September 24, 2003 So those -- that started a period of no communications that I really don’t know how my mother survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But I guess both parents were pretty strong people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  What was her state of mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">You said she was wearing black at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  And she was just keeping busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">That’s why I say, with volunteer organizations, she decided to help in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and it was pretty close to where we lived, so that when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- she always had lunch for me and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And we really adapted very quickly to life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">In 1941 -- first of all in 1940 I felt very privileged, we got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , which was up to that point my father could -- did -- commuted to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , because again, every dollar was extremely precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I remember getting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , getting the first glimpse of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and we took our first vacation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smokies</span> that August. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I was a boy scout and did all the basic activities that one is supposed to do and I felt very comfortable, and had no problems getting used to the community.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  The one thing which we were laughing about is that I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I developed hay fever, and when I -- I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when I was 11 and I was able to take my folding camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">When I was 12, I became an enemy alien and we had to register as enemy aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And technically we’re not allowed to get out of the 42September 24, 2003 country -- get out of the -- <span class="REGION">Montgomery county</span> , which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> ’s <span class="REGION">county</span> , without permission from the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And basically we were laughing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">In other words, I as an 11 year old was free to travel, my parents weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But --
QUESTION:  Oh see -- you were not considered an enemy alien?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Not until I turned 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  Oh, oh, oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  That was in 1940 -- 1942 [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Did that make you angry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  We were laughing about it, because there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">There were travel restrictions, gasoline rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So what’s the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But these other -- you -- you have to -- you have to laugh at anything that’s funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Otherwise, of course everybody -- we went through all the things which were done during World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We were encouraged to ge -- to get Jo -- when we were in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we were encouraged to get jobs to replace people. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> for 35 cents an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But it -- there were such shortages and they didn't -- I mean, my mother packed a lunch which was probably worth about two hours -- two or three hours work. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But it gave everybody a sense of accomplishment, and my father regularly volunteered to give physicals, I think 43September 24, 2003 twice a week at the <span class="BUILDING">recruitment center</span> and every -- everybody pitched in and World War II was unique that it was -- got everybody’s hundred percent -- it was a moral war that everybody supported.</span></p>

QUESTION:  The news of the war, and how did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  Radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">In other words, I remember Lowell Thomas, H.V. Kaltenborn, oth -- Edward R.

<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION:  What about being aware of what was happening to the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  We knew it was bad, but there was a sense of helplessness. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I remember the episode with the Saint Louis, which was absolutely unbelievable, that -- we worshipped Roosevelt, who at the same time was such a political animal that he would do anything to -- basically do what he felt was politically expedient. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And of course, it’s easy to say that in retrospect, but at the time, it couldn’t be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Whether it was a bombing of the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> , and -- or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  When did your family know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="567">44September 24, 2003
ANSWER:  Well, we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> very er -- early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="568"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was established before 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I was absolutely flabbergasted when I looked at the map, to see how close <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> , and when we were back there, I took that one day trip into the <span class="REGION">area</span> from czechsla -- from the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> , and when I looked at the map I was flabbergasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">In fact, I had a very interesting -- got a very interesting letter from the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> last week, forwarding a letter that they received from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> that in -- the local organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> has -- I forgot the exact name, something for international relations, is going to dedicate a memorial to the Jewish community, at the site of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">When I was there seven years ago, it was a rundown <span class="DLF">playground</span> with asphalt and not a plaque, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And the Jewish old age <span class="BUILDING">home</span> became a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">After that visit, everything else was pretty much unchanged, but I couldn’t wait to get out and they- now got notice that they’re dedicating a memorial on the site of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and that the dedication is going to be on the 28" and 29" of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And my wife and I and my three kids, and Joe and his family are going there for the dedication. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Also visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which I understand has a new <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I feel I want to show the kids our roots, and I also want to show the people who are doing this that it’s about time. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">That’s [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">In fact, when I wrote the letter of acceptance that we’re all coming, and I mentioned the European titles, that all 45September 24, 2003 my children are being doctors and lawyers, all have the European titles as doctors, that we’re coming and that I hope the visit will be a very productive and memorable experience for all of us and them. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And that’s the reason I feel strongly about going. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I si -- it still hasn’t been determined whether they’re financing it, but I’m willing to finance it, because I think it 1s for a good cause, even though a couple of my kids disagree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  Will you be speaking to any groups over there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  Apparently yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don’t know what the language barrier is going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But the head of the organization writes perfect English, so knowing that most <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are bilingual, we should be able to communicate to some extent, although when we were there seven years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Opin</span> , that’s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my mother was born, where I found the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where the business was and also where the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> was, which is now a Russian style office building, I couldn’t communicate in either English or German. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And when we went to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , we finally pointed to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> next to us, where they had soup and a sandwich, and that’s how we ate lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So it should be an interesting experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Let’s get back to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Any other mention that you want to make of the war? [</span><span class="sentence" id="589">phone ringing, tape break]. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">As I was saying -- saying to get back t-to the war, you were following what was happening and communication got less and less -- 46September 24, 2003
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  -- from the family, and -- and your parents state of mind because they were busy, was functioning and they were doing worthwhile projects and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  They were definitely not only functioning, but became extremely active in any kind of relief efforts. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And as I said, it went to other causes after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Because that was their way of making up for the family that was lost, that philosophically our feeling is, you can’t replace what’s lost, but you can better what can be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Were you speaking to your family still in German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We stopped speaking German probably within six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But of course we all spoke with an accent, and I do not have very -- I am [indecipherable] graphic and picture person and I do not have very much language talent. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Therefore, I never heard the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And that’s the only way I can explain the fact that I reta -- I retain my accent after 65 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Then it’s the end of the war, and what was that like for you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  Well, that’s when everything unfolded and the realization came that nobody could be traced. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">In other words, it was finalized by Leo Baeck, which must have been in the late 40’s or early 50’s when he came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And it became quite 47September 24, 2003 obvious that my uncles never made -- never made it back to where they came from, and as I said, you have to use the energy positively and that was the family phi -- philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  So you became a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> student, were you active in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and have a lot of interests?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Very -- a lot of interests, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I consider myself a reasonably good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I participated in various clubs, a lot -- mostly political. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I guess it shaped me also in a fairly liberal philosophy that Jews have always prospered in any fu -- liberal society, and it’s important that everybody has the rights that they’re entitled to because it rubs off. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And I still thi -- I travel a lot, being that it’s my business, but I still kiss the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> every time we come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , whether I agree with policies or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  And then you completed <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Western Reserve University</span> and during my sophomore year I met my wife, who by some accident or act of faith was the first European woman I ever dated. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And we got -- we were married as soon as I finished <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It’s just about 53 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">48September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  Ho-How did you meet your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Both of us went on unwilling vacations where our parents wanted to rest a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Placid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And then we started corresponding and one thing led to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We kept the New York Central Railroad in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">They went bankrupt after we got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  So where was she living?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  And did your -- you said your wife was European, where did her family come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And when -- when the anschluss occurred, her father was also in the leather business and had a customer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , a person, not Jewish, who offered them an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And they came here -- they wen -- their name is Simon, maybe they had Jewish roots somewhere, but they definitely were not, and they lived on the <span class="DLF">Main Line</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And they came over in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> as I did, one sailing earlier, the one that was -- that was sent back during <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But 49September 24, 2003 we probably wouldn’t -- wou-would have hated each other wa -- if we met when we were nine years old.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  I was in charge of production of textiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I was in -- for a <span class="BUILDING">textile converting firm</span> , until I retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And after six months of retirement we -- rather, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> because my two daughters both had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> here and retire -- an-and found New York boys to marry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , so we decided to live in -- to move here where we could grow new roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And we ve been living here for about 10 years, and since I’d done a lot of business travel, I went int -- went to <span class="BUILDING">travel school</span> to learn the computers and I’ve been doing that since we live here and I work full time and travel a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  When were your children born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  1951, ’54 and ’55. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And they all have families. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Joanie, being the oldest has two- has a daughter of 18 and a son 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And he is the one who is going with us to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> na -- which became <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after World War II when I -- I say -- I became Polish retroactively when the <span class="DLF">borders</span> changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And my other -- my son has a 50September 24, 2003 daughter who is 12, and my other daughter has two daughters, age 14 and 12, who also live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Jerry, my son, lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Oh [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Mm-h. Now -- and your parents stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  My fa -- my father stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> unt -- until he died in 1979. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">My mother tried to s-stay in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> and unfortunately developed fairly severe Parkinson’s Disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And finally after she couldn’t manage with round-the-clock help, she -- we brought her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in 1993, and she died in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew home</span> , 1995. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But my kids did know her.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  -- and your father sponsored a lot of affidavits. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Were they friendly with many other refugee Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Some, but their roots really were in the general community, both Jewish and non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">In other words, we tended not to be cliquish and believed philosophically in being fully integrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">To me it was a step backwards to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> , which is kind of a gilded ghetto, and I prefer <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">51September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  Let’s talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Do you -- which you’ve already expressed some already. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">D-Do you feel that you would be a different person today if you hadn’t had the childhood and the experience that you went through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  I’ve been -- let me answer it in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I’ve met a fairly substantial number of Germans and I confront the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I feel that the Holocaust is probably almost as much part of the German psyche as it 1s the Jewish psyche. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I’ve also noticed that the -- by the numbers that come to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I feel ve had a much, much richer life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> than I ever would have had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> , even if it hadn’t -- there hadn’t been a war or Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So I sometimes use a statement in speaking to Germans, the best revenge 1s living well. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I believe in that philosophy and I think our children reflect it, that the opportunities, I’m talking about cultural and otherwise, that we’ve had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> are far greater than anything we could have experienced in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> in the best of times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  Ho-How did you convey your religious feelings to your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  We sent them to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I’m a great believer that the two most important things you give your children are roots and wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And they all not only went through <span class="BUILDING">Confirmation class</span> , but they all went through post-Confirmation 52September 24, 2003 class in order to be rooted not only Jewish religion, but Jewish philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I’m a philosophical Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">My father used to say, I may eat traif, but I like to think kosher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">End of Tape Two, Side B 53September 24, 2003 Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">This is tape number three, side A. When did you change your name to Frank?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  When I started working for a <span class="BUILDING">commercial firm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">First th-there were two things which I had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">One is sound American, and change my signature that nobody could read it, because at the time we were doing export business, the first customer I di -- I did correspondence with was M.B. Herrairi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And when I wrote a letter and signed my name, my boss said, this is something you have to change immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And he signed just initials and make a scribble and you never put any name, just initials, that we can tell whom -- who you are, and then I just -- it was easier to be Frank because it’s a common name, people remember it better, and I had no trouble doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  How did your parents feel about your changing your name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  No objection. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Although my father kept his name Hans, and he kept the second N, because he said, I don’t want to be -- I don’t want to live with any kind of pretense. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">This is who I am and I don’t want to change it. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">My wife has adopted that philosophy and insists on the two N’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">She sa -- wh-when my kids went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the company made mistake on the nametags, she sent them back once, 54September 24, 2003 because she’s very firm on it and my kids also retained the Liebermann with two N’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  Did your children have a -- become a Bar and Bat Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Oh definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Again, we believe in -- we believe in studying and in the Jewish philosophy that you really -- in 0 -- in order to defend yourself, you have to know who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And probably the people who fared least well in the Holocaust were those who really didn’t know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">In other words, even the ones who converted were considered Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And they didn’t have the background to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I would say this is one of the things I learned from the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Well, you were very young when you went through what you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">When your children were that age, did it bring, you know, seven, eight, nine and so forth, did that -- did it bring back that part of your childhood to you, when they were the same age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  No, not really at that age, but I know that my children persuaded my mother to write her autobiography, because they wanted their sense of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Unfortunately, it was fairly late and we had to do a lot of editing because she wrote a lot of notes originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And I want to thank my daughter-in-law, who did a wonderful job on the computer in putting her various stories together in a logical 55September 24, 2003 way, which became difficult at the time she did it, which was probably in her mid- 80’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  What happens to you when you see a swastika now? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">What runs through your head?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Since I -- I an -- I would say I have come to grips with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I woul -- I’m saddened when I see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I’m beyond angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Basi -- as I say, I confront Germans at various times and I feel you can’t undo history, but you have to ta -- you have to learn from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">This is one reason why -- my wife managed to get me tickets for the consecration of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> on that rainy, cold, miserable day, when there wasn’t a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> to be had in the part that was roped off for people who wanted to bear witness, while in front, the part that was left for the dignitaries was half empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It’s also wa -- why, when I had a chance, I volunteered at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , because I feel I can convey a message and I’m glad to be doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">My kids are very much aware of their roots, and that’s a reason why they are going on the trip next month, because I said we be -- as a family believe in roots and wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  Are you angry that you had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and your family had to go through what it did, and you had the losses that you had, and other people didn’t? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Let’s say Jews here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">56September 24, 2003
ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Look, we made the best of a bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We were very fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">My father’s good fortune was that he lost his living relatively early in 1936, and that he had the foresight to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">My father-in-law, who left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , said you know, his good luck was that he was not too old or too rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Either of those circumstances made many people victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  And early on it’s a very, very traumatic experience to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I know it from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , or fro-from Great Neck to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> that it wasn’t easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Moving to a strange <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is extremely hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">But once you do it and succeed, I feel I could not have had the life that I’ve had, if we had stayed, forgetting about the politics and everything else that occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So, I’m certainly not angry, but I’m trying to be constructive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  How old were your children when you told them about the loss of their -- their relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  I don’t remember, but we made no secrets of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">No, it -- we’ve always been open. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I’ve -- I’m not smart enough to keep secrets, because then you always have to remember what you s -- whom you said what to, and we kept various pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">We still have albums of family that are -- particularly my granddaughter has used for some of her art projects, and that’s part of our heritage, that we’re survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">57September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  What does it mean to you to be a survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  I’m happy to have made the best of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I’ve probably become very family conscious on how important it is, and I think I’m try -- I’m trying to pass that on to my children and grandchildren, with whom we try to travel and give them as many benefits as we can f -- as we can find, or as they’re willing to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">That’s -- that’s all I can say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about some of your political views. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">You -- you did allude to that before --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  -- because of what you went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">You want to le -- elaborate a little more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I would say I’m -- I -- I’ve become a student of history, Biblical and otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And if you do that, you realize that the Jewish community has always done well in a free society. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And therefore, I think there’s a reason why Jews tend to be liberal in their own self interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And some of the trends we have th -- do worry me, because we don’t seem to be getting our message across as well as we did in former years. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">In other words, I’m not -- when -- even when Senator Lieberman mentions God too often, I don’t think that’s -- that belongs in politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Now, one of the things that made things so easy for the Germans is that the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were fun-funded by the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">In other words, you gave a 58September 24, 2003 certain part of your taxes to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> of your choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And therefore, they had complete records of what everybody was and thought, whether they were with them inic -- or against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I therefore don’t like some of the trends that we see now in fighting terrorism, of invading civil liberties. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I mean, I certainly don’t mind giving my name, but some of the illegal searches and so forth, scare me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  Does that remind you of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 30’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  That’s what I’m talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And being specific, Mr. Ashcroft, who I think is going over the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So it has shaped my political views.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  What are your thoughts about the State of Israel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  Well, I am very sad that the middle in the world is losing power. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">In other words, the extra -- you only hear from the extremes, in other words, the right wing or the left wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">The only way that that conflict will ever be solved is through some fairly tough compromises on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And the further we go to the extremes, the harder it’s going to be to come to terms with It.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  What are your thoughts about the necessity for a State of Israel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  Look, it’s -- 1t certainly -- I’m very much for the state, even though I wasn’t always. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I didn’t want a nationalistic -- I didn’t want to be identified with policies with whi-which I disagree. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">At this point I believe it’s here to stay, it’s -- when the whole world closed, if we had had a State of Israel, that wouldn’t have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">59September 24, 2003 Philosophically, I think the Likud policy of trying to presser -- of the <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> 1s contrary to Jewish la -- to Jewish law and contrary to Jewish interests, because they’re trying to create a <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , where we have -- you can’t be a religious state where some people are more equal than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And there is merit in- if you want to have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> , it has to be pretty much limited to the Jewish population and you can’t be Imperialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Because strictly on basis of the increased birthrate, if they carry it on the way it was done in <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> , where it used to be 50-50, and then you had a ruling minority, that is poison for stability. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So I’m -- I’m thinking of it again from a philosophical rather than a political point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  And you are concerned about the stability of the State of Israel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  Certainly as an occupying power, it can’t work in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  Did you have -- or did you follow the Eichmann trial, and what were your thoughts when that was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Look, he was a monster. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I had -- I don’t think that he could get justice, no matter what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I suppose it was expedient to get rid of him, even though a -- I think they were successful in not making him a martyr, but there was a danger of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Sometimes a MacArthur idea of old soldiers, sometimes if they could have faded away, it probably would have been just as good. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">In other words, I’m not a revenge person, but I’m not always sure that that’s for the best in the 60September 24, 2003 same way that eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, which they are doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because it just creates more unrest and more anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">On the other hand, I understand that you can’t let yourself become a victim without reacting. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">It’s a dilemma.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Do you feel German in any way now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">In fact, my -- Iam much more sensitive, though, to German characteristics, which probably wouldn't bother somebody else, they do bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I’m talking about the pushiness that I’ve -- I’ve gone through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in part. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">In a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , if they have the sale, they go with elbows. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">That probably bothers me more than it would bother somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Or the very rigid bureaucrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So I’m sensitive to those characteristics, but I try to avoid them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  So you have no emotional attachment in the sense of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  None at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">None at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">In fact, I once got in a conversation with a tra -- when we were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="788">| got on fairly early and I got a very good <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and opposite me sat -- somebody came in later and said in German to the neighbor, I wonder where I can get something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I gave him directions in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So he looked at me and said, how come you speak such good German? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And I gave him the answer, translated, I was once German. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And he said, how can you say that, it’s your <span class="REGION">Fatherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I said, not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And I got into a discussion 61September 24, 2003 with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">His father was a minister and he hadn’t really come to grips a fact that he didn’t speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I think I had him in tears during that trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">He was a tour leader for Budget Tour. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We were going on a f -- in a fairly comfortable way. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And that’s where I originally started using the term, the best revenge 1s living well. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And I’ve used it several times since, but that really brought it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And that sums up my- my German feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit now about the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">You did mention that your wife arranged for tickets for the opening ceremonies, but what was your first encounter with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">ANSWER:  Well, at the opening, I had to take a woman from the Temple sisterhood on the condition that I take her out for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Which I dutifully did and I went through it and of course I heard the protest of six million lies right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">It was a very emotional morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And then I just felt I wanted to bear witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But after September 11", when the travel business really collapsed, and for a month we did nothing but give credits and retur -- arrange for refunds for the days that nobody could travel, I was asked to work three days a week, and I took the course at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I started to volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Now my -- my agency asked me to come back in January, and I told her look, once they’ ve invested their time, I feel I have an 62September 24, 2003 obligation. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And ever since I’ve been doing that Thursday morning, then I work the rest of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I get th -- I get to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> by about two o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  So you’ve been working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> since January 2002?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  Actually, yeah, since the fall of 2001.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  Right, after September 11", and then you took --
ANSWER:  Yeah, it’s almost two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  It'll be two years fing -- December first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  In between the time of the opening in ’93, and -- and September 11, 2001, what was your contact with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  Just that I had gone a couple of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I decided to donate my grandparent’s business papers, which my mother kept with all kinds of correspondence, and the bookkeeper had preserved them, and whatever other letters we had in our collection, because I felt my kids can’t read German, I can barely read German because the grammar is so cumbersome that I may as well give it to somebody who can -- who can use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So I’ve had that relationship with them, and I had gone a couple of times, and of course, I’d recommended it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="824">QUESTION:  What kind of work do you do at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  So you’re 1n vi -- you’re 1n visitor services.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  Visitor services, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And frankly, I enjoy the once a week, invigorating experience of going to the mall area and interesting people that we meet at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  Has working there affected your memories of your early childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">No, I have no -- I am -- I am past the point of being emotionally repressive or -- in other words, I -- I handle it in an unemotional way now. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Even though when I gave the lecture and put it all together, at the end I was tearful.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  This is a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that you spoke to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">But, let’s see, I keep on living and try to make the most of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  When you’re at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and you’ve gone through the exhibit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> , in the 1930’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , do you identify with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  The one that really got me -- oh, sh -- one second, I turn it off [tape break] -- not re -- the one that I got -- probably was most emotional about was the present exhibit on the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  This is the hidden children exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And the last ti -- wa -- again, when I was emotional is in “Schindler’s List” when they lead the children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">That’s something that I can’t come to terms with, and I think of my cousin, who when we left she was three years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">QUESTION:  And who did not survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  Who did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I mean, none of the children survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Do you identify with the children yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I mean, I identify as what happened to -- children were totally helpless and -- and I would sa -- it’s probably -- that’s the only pogrom that’s di -- that really -- attacked the children first. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">From a phils -- philosophical way of destroying the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">65September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  What is your relationship with other survivor volunteers at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">ANSWER:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I have no -- I mean, I like some better than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Some people you relate to, that’s normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  Do you exchange stories with them?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Do you feel a connection with those who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”
ANSWER:  Again, I look strictly as people. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I don’t have any -- no more -- I usually ask where people are from, whether they’re from <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> that I’ve been to. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">From the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , that’s more interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">This is tape number three, side B, and we were talking about your experiences at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Would you encourage other survivors to volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  I think it’s -- I think it’s quite important that I sometimes do ask, if I’m the survi -- actually, I don’t consider myself a survivor, because my parents with their good fortune got me out before ’38, or during °38 and I really had a minimum of 66September 24, 2003 trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">But by being represented as somebody who 1s authentic, I think it adds to the experience of people at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I do get asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  You get asked what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Whether I was a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And I say yes, even though I don’t believe it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">In other words, the category of survivor is somebody who really went through some of the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> which happened after Crystal Night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  What are your feelings when you walk into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  I think it’s a fabulous piece of architecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">In other words, the somewhat disjointed look is, I think, a marvelous achievement. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">People often ask me, you know, about the map that they give out. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And I said, it really doesn’t help because people didn’t know from one moment to the next what’s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So you can’t put that in a map. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">That’s my standard comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  Do you feel like you belong there? </span><span class="sentence" id="882">There’s a connection to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">In other words, I feel that <span class="NPIP">somewhere</span> I can contribute more than I probably could elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  But I meant an emotional connection when you walk in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  Ah, I do not tend to be that emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">In other words, I appreciate the happenings and I -- I try to ra -- I try to believe in reason over emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Not that I 67September 24, 2003 don’t get emotional, but this is not -- I don’t have the connection that way, except I think that it -- that it’s an important part of education and I have taken -- I’ve invited -- for instance, I’ve invited my kids and grandchildren to the celebration of survivors, November first. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And I think that’s important. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">But from an educational point of view, rather than a strict emotional point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">QUESTION:  What are your thoughts about the non-Jewish staff and volunteers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">ANSWER:  They again -- 1t depends which ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Some of them are strictly business, others are really devoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And also in th -- among the volunteers are some non-Jewish volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">You don’t know what reasons people have for reacting. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So-Some of them take it strictly they’ve had experience in <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and it’s a museum job. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Others do it because they feel it -- it’s particularly important. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And both kinds of people are useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">No other comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  Do you go to many of the lectures and presentations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  I don’t have time, because I leave there and go directly to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">If they have something in the evening, preferably on weekends, it’s much easier than during the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Course I -- I get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> around quarter to six. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">By the time I have dinner during the week, that’s -- that makes for a long day -- we -- and we go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> a lot in the weekends and have cond -- all kinds of subscriptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">It’s -- you can only do so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">68September 24, 2003
QUESTION:  You had said that the hidden children exhibit was particularly meaningful for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Are there any other exhibits in the permanent collection that -- or any other temporary exhibits that really were very memorable, or are very memorable for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  Again, they have all been very educational, whether it’s bringing up the book burning and the intellectual philosophy of race superiority and so forth, which was popular in -- throughout the world, it was just taking that to an extreme. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And I say one of the -- one of the things that’s unbelievable about the Nazi movement is the high emotional pitch that it could get to. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And that’s such a danger sign that it still hasn’t been explained to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">In other words, how the political rallies can be so devastating. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">On so -- so-called educated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">That’s the reason I tr -- I try to be unemotional.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Because it’s dangerous to be emotional.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">You said it in different words.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  Has the world learned lessons from the Holocaust, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  I wish it really had, but the fact that it’s recognized hopefully will be helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">We probably won’t know for another two or three generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  In closing, do you have any message to those two or three generations? </span><span class="sentence" id="921">69September 24, 2003
ANSWER:  Unless you lear -- unless you study history, you can repeat mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">That’s the reason I’ve been -- i -- the Holocaust really has made me look at history, including by the way, the re-religious history of the New Testament, or rather the -- the Christian Bible, to be correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">That in making it the national religion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , Constantine basically had to absolve the Romans. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And therefore, it was easiest to blame the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And that is not an uncommon way of interpreting history, that it’s always written by the victors, about the people who can’t answer, after the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So the study of accurate history is extremely important and history is generally not taught very well, as to what the real issues are. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I think that’s the end of my thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  Anything else you’d like to add before we close?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Anyway, thank you for a nice interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Thank you very much for doing the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frank Liebermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">End of Tape Three, Side B Conclusion of Interview </span>
