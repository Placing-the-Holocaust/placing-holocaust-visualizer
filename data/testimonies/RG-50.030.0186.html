<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you... Uh, welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And would you tell me your name, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name is Liane Reif-Lehrer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Iwas born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zweitebitziek</span> , on November 14th, 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Uh, tell me about your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Uh, what did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Uh, my father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And then uh went on, after he finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , to study dentistry; and then opened a dental practice uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh, my mother was also born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ; and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I think, probably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And somehow met my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's practice off the ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I think during those early years my mother helped out-- answering the phone and...and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">But then after that, she really did not work as long as we were still in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was inside our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There were two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that ...and they had the <span class="DLF">wall</span> broken down between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on one level. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh, so I guess it...it was fairly thriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social activity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Maybe some <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And uh I think once a week they went to some relatives' and played cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And uh, you know, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have been doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Uh, what about your...your very uh early years? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh, you were born in '34. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">What do you remember of your very early childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Well, my memories are very spotty. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh, but uh...[ remember ...J remember my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , and I remember my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember parts of the layout of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Not all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But I uh...I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , for example; and I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh, I think I liked messing around in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in there and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh ,the cook used to let me stand up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother was not too thrilled about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act... We...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but "servants," in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I mean, people who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were sort of fun for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I remember a fair number of...of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Like when they uh ...they used to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the <span class="DLF">roof</span> maybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And when they rolled up... Especially there were long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So we had these long runners, and they would let me stand or sit on one end; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know, getting swung in the sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh, and I remember getting rides on brooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">You know, I'd put my feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Uh, so I remember that. [...</span><span class="sentence" id="45">1 remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I think in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there was my uh sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and...and maybe... I only remember that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> , although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to believe that I still slept in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And then right in...in uh <span class="DLF">line</span> with that, there was this other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> where I think the governess slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh, and I remember quite well the layout of my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and where there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span> , and I think there was a furry animal, and...and where the <span class="DLF">window</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about those early uh years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What about people? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">What about your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">What do you remember about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">What do you remember about...? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I believe you had a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Tell me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> era about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Uh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we were already in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> long since by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But my mother always had a large picture of my father on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , uh her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night table</span> ; and I remember a day when I looked at that picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered having then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Let's get a sense of...of... You described a child having a good time in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Uh, as the Hitler years progressed and we move toward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh can you tell me what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about Kristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh, my mother was holding me in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh, and there was this knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And uh I re...1 mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And uh my mother went to... We had one of these peepholes that has like a metal cover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody whammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And then the superintendent called out, "Don't worry for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It's just me; let us in." </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I thought two men came in, but my brother tells me actually were five or six. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And uh I think they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They kind of rummaged through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I...and I...they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically remember them taking is that the cook... There was a white <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where they kept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And...and there was a uh...a tall can from these things called "pastilles," which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are sort of like pennies. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they took that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I was not disturbed...[ don't remember being disturbed about them taking anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But I remember being disturbed about them taking that. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And uh...so that evening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But I...you know, then it blacks out on either side of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother-who has often asked me, you know, "Why do you think backwards instead of living your life forwards?" </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Uh, and I...I mean, that's a hard question to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But about a year ago, when he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I suddenly realized that I guess... guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that era, it's perhaps a little easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what happened and then what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of a black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And uh I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person or some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to remind me of... But I...I can't get it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a lot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me, and...aand so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that relationship might have been like, but I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I can't bring it back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">You've moved to your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on either side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You had started...your parents had started looking for papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , or a way to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father was one of uh quite a few children. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And some people say five, some people say seven, some people say nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I have a feeling it was either seven or nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh, and there actually was a set of twins in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , uh I think maybe as early as 1920's. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And there had been some talk in the family, apparently, of coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk got more. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, "Look, I'm forty years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I don't know English. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> without extensive re-training. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">How can I...? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And, you know, I have such a good practice here. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">How can I just get up and go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh, well, my father never made it to Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Uh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And so, uh on the morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the morning to do a number of chores. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they were supposed to meet, I think, either at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of this cousin where they sometimes played cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And my father never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story <span class="DLF">stairwell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly depressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer allowed to to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And so I kind of grew up with uh...[ mean, a very strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and she...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I think, really, that must have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But anyway, you know, I didn't really think about it very much uh either. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">As an adult now, as I look back and I ask people, "Well, how...?" </span><span class="sentence" id="128">You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things that were being done to people, my question has been: "How do you know that he jumped?" </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And, well, you know, and they say, "Well, we don't know that he jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But he was very depressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide." </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And uh...and my brother also provides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would be better off without a male. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But I can't help always wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I mean, nobody would know the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So I don't know what the answer to that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But, anyway, he never came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So you and your mother now were left--this is at the end of September 1938--uh without a father and husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morning were taken on Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So...
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So we move from September to November. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Kristallnacht happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You are without passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">What did your mother do? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">All of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately did. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which was my father's sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this was, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's death. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think, the packing of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what came out of it at the other end. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous assortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But anyway, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was packed, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ; and it was in storage for three years until we finally came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Uh, so I...I do think I remember the day the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was being packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But then again, there 1s...
QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was packed; and then what did you and your mother do, specifically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was leaving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh, and because people were not allowed to take money out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> --I think you were allowed four or ten dollars per person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class tickets, uh bought first class tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you might as well, you know, spend it on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got these visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Uh, and on...in early May of 1939, we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> uh to get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Now, I don't remember anything about the voyage except, I think, I remember two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">One is that there's kind of a sense of fear that I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of <span class="DLF">checkpoints</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I think that part of that must have started at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And from what my brother tells me it was very scary in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Was something going to happen before you get on got on? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Uh, and the other thing is that I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ; and I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white sun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. (</span><span class="sentence" id="170">Laughter) Uh, and then I don't remember anything else from from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But uh...I mean, I know that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , of course, came to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and we were not allowed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh, and my brother tells me that uh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> at that the time that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> docked. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And he rode out on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come and see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Uh...
QUESTION:  Who was the lawyer? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Was he a connection with you personally, or with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Well, we were quite friendly with them then when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But I think we were friends...I'm not sure that our parents were such good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I have a feeling that the friendship might have come about through the friendship between their son and my brother, but I'm not sure about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But they certainly figured in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I mean, I...I remem...they were always talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Uh, so he came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , to...to see us, apparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> 1is...1s of course well-known, historically. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was turned back, and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And that's when I start to have much more coherent memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  You mean, when we got back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  When you got back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in uh centrally...<span class="REGION">central France</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  How did you get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  I don't remember getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , we were put up in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I guess there must have been a group of about twenty of us from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Uh, and I remember this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and I remember this...what I thought was a very, very large square in front of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But in my adult life--when I went back in 1978, I think it was, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> -the square didn't look nearly as large as I remembered it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="196">Laughter) Uh, uh the things I remember from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> : uh, I remember where our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was--it was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And uh...and I remember some fairly dramatic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I remember having this little so-called boyfriend that I guess I played with. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Uh... What I remember much more dramatically are two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I remember my mother was always very neat and clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Uh, and I remember that my mother was really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and that there were cats running around on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">food preparation tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely horrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> , but no, you know, <span class="INT_SPACE">bathing rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And my mother was totally horrified by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did talk about "You don't know how much perfume this lady wore," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So I remember trivia like that, and I remember somehow running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And I remember uh...I remember once these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a chicken that was going to be used for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And...and that was really... remember that with great horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Uh, so I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke up and there uh was this incredible commotion <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And there were uh shots; and, I mean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And the Germans had come in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and uh a lot of the German soldiers either... I don't know if they also lived there, but they certainly were around all the time and they had meals there. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And one of the things that I remember, to this day, being incredibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I was only about five and a half or so--uh is that I was... First of all, you have to understand I was always a very "good girl," and I always did everything I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Uh, and I was told that under no circumstances was I to let on that I spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Now, how they expected to perpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">My brother had had French lessons in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , so he probably did have some command of French. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But I was kind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I remember very clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, "Je ne comprends pas. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Je ne comprends pas." </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And I remember also thinking that there was something very funny about, I guess, having always been taught that you're not supposed to lie and here I was being instructed to tell this out-and-out lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And also nobody explained to me why I was telling this lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And so I was really very perplexed, I think, by this whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But I did exactly what I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I remember the soldiers saying all these things to me--which I, of course, understood perfectly--but just saying "Je ne comprends pas." </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So that was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Another thing... Oh, even before that time, there was one other thing I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">There was an air raid one night, and I...somehow I...I got away from my mother and I ran <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And they had to come and retrieve me. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I somehow thought it was interesting, or fun, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Uh, but anyway, uh...so for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , in the morning the Germans would do these...1 don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Whatever you call them--you know, maneuvers or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They'd march around the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in formation, with their big boots and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And uh my mother and my brother and I would watch from the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And there was one soldier...and I don't remember his face, but I remember, I remember his form. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I remember that he had sort of wavy sandy-colored hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I...I can't help wondering, in retrospect, maybe he didn't even know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I mean, or maybe he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I always sort of in the past assumed that he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But now I think, "Well, you know, maybe he didn't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But he threw me candies uh on a number of occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And my mother was sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And here Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And then, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me a little doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I think that interaction through; I think that interaction very, very strongly colored my life attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Uh, because I think...I think even then, you know, I somehow must have known that these were the bad guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But this guy, who I have a feeling might have been you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was just nice, you know; and he was nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Uh, and...and maybe I jump to conclusions on very naive grounds; but several years later, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and kids would and...and their parents ask me, you know, really ridiculous things to say to a child--like, uh, "How do you like <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And, "Do you hate the Germans?" </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I remember always saying, "No, I don't hate the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There are good Germans, and there are bad Germans." </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I ...1 mean maybe this is simplistic, but I've always thought that it really had to do with this one soldier that somehow made me get a...a very sensible attitude, even though I was so young, about the differences between people. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I've always sort of very fondly remembered that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , uh and you had these these memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Uh, how long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Uh, we must have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> for somewhere between nine months and a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  What is your perception of your mother during that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I had realized this more when she was still around-- my mother must have really, basically, been an incredibly strong person to have gone through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Because when I try to think back on it, I often think I...you know, I don't think I could have done the things that she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  That's not what I'm asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I'm asking what your memory of her...
ANSWER:  [...1 know what you're asking, and I...I really had to give that preamble; because my...my sense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow never got it all together except for the practical things. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">That she somehow was so...I'm not sure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I mean, she was... And who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I mean, maybe I would have been the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But I mean, she really...she was in mourning for my father for the rest of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I guess she was a woman who already had learned something like five languages, but she could not learn French. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You know, it was not just there at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Uh, and I think uh... I wish I could remember the German word that that she used to use a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That she was just uh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know what to do, you know, with herself or what was going on, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Uh, and I think the... What she had always told me was that after the Germans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess, uh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , and that whether she left or not he was leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some refugees in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Uh, and there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who decided not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the picture of before. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But anyway, so I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">What I do remember is that one night we left everything that we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We left everything, and we left in the dark of night. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I think I have a...my recollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And this group of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that went to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh, and then uh so I remem.... I remember walking to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , but I don't remember anything of this trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But what my brother tells me is that uh when we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> --which I guess was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poitiers--</span> and we had to go through this uh...you know, whatever you do at <span class="DLF">borders</span> , uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940, the lower echelon people in these <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were still French people rather than Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And apparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and said, "Look, you know, I've really got to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , because I'm here and my husband is already on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And so this woman said, "Yeah, alright." </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You know, and stamped her whatever you needed to get stamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And then she turned and said, "You know, that's also the situation for all these other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They also have somebody else waiting on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said, "Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">OK." </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And so we all got across. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we went to somehow uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , and now that's where my memory picks up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> ; and I...I remember, I think I slept on a...on a scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You know, the kind of thing you weigh the baggage on. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just one night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an abandoned uh <span class="BUILDING">circus arena</span> that was...I guess it was stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And uh...and I remember waking up the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just sleeping on this...on this stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for six weeks and that people graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">You know, gradually people found <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live, and so you kind of got to move to the better <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And then, apparently, the...the most desirable <span class="NPIP">place</span> was around the periphery of the <span class="BUILDING">arena</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There were these uh...what I call orange crate make-shift <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> that had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span> in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And so that was... for the last few days we were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And then, uh somehow there was a... this Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And they found uh a uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I think had been a <span class="INT_SPACE">pool hall</span> , and there was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that must have been... I mean, it was really not a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty feet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Certainly not...not any bigger than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Uh, and there were about thirty women who slept in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And then, right above that, there was another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where all the...the men slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And I don't remember there being any other female children except for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection of anything but adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he might have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But then, I mean, this is where I really start to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I mean, I remember this <span class="NPIP">place</span> well. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And actually, I went back there in 1963 to visit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And uh so we slept in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ; and at night we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span> , and we'd line them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It was body to body on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Uh, and then in the morning, they would get piled up against the side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And there were all these sort of orange crates, you know, really wooden kind of crates that got pulled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And we sat on those and...and ate off them and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And uh so we were in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for...I don't know, quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I began going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">My first year of schooling was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> ; and I remember walking to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I remember the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I still have my three notebooks from that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember as a quite not very pleasant woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And uh she seemed very old to me them. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I mean, she had sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she sat up on a dias. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things that stand out in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Uh one is that every morning she would come down every <span class="DLF">aisle</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually spreading this. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And so sure enough, one day I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and one of the women spotted that I had lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every day who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it mercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head out. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So that was kind of horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The other thing that I remember is I was ...I was very anxious to be very good in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I did very well at almost everything except penmanship. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever; and I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French 1's and s's you're supposed to have this little bump, you know at the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And I could never quite get that right. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I mean, she did...she accepted all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I've never had a good penmanship, but she accepted everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But she was constantly after me about that little, you know, squiggle that I couldn't get right. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The other thing that I remember is that everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And so uh I...my brother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh something that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And my mother insisted that we share that. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that I really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I got sent into bakeries to beg for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And the <span class="DLF">line</span> was, "I've got uh...I have... have money, and I have ration coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But uh..." Or maybe we didn't have ration coupons, whatever it was, you know. "...</span><span class="sentence" id="352">we really need bread." </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And so that was my role. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I would...that bread was not only for us, but 1t would be shared with some of the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And when I was interviewing my brother last year--because I wrote an article about this-- [...I said to my brother, "Did it ever occur to anybody how incredibly demeaning it must have been to a little girl to have to go in and beg for bread?" </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And my brother, who is a very practical person, looked me straight in the eye and said, "It wasn't demeaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It was bread." </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And uh...but somehow I can't feel that way about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And uh...and I guess... mean, I guess we shared duties in that he had to...all the...you know, he filled out all the forms, and when things had to be packed or when you had to go to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to ask about visas, I mean, he got to do all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And, of course, I was too young to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But uh but I got this horrible chore to do, because I was younger and cuter I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Uh, so I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Uh, and then I remember very clearly, two times uh...I think you were allowed a pound of potatoes per month per person and one egg per month per person, according to these ration coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And so, one time my mother heard that there were eggs out in this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , which was...I mean, I remember just walking what seemed like miles and miles and miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with these eggs, and my mother opened them and they were all rotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And then another time, we heard that there were potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And again, I mean, you know, it seemed as though we walked for just ages and we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with these three pounds of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And I guess we were just... this is like such a feast that uh my mother just cooked the three pounds of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And I think we just ate them all up. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Uh, and then there was a...probably the most wonderful birthday of my life happened in this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I don't know how my mother pulled this off; but on my birthday, uh she came with a little brown paper bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And 1n this paper bag was--I don't remember, I think it might have been like a peach, or...and one other big fruit and some dried fruits. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And it was probably the nicest present I've ever gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So, uh so I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And...and the two other dramatic things that I remember from that era is one that my brother somehow had a Bar Mitzvah in the midst of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I don't remember much about the Bar Mitzvah, except that he was given a...a silk...a beautiful blue silk string bag--which we had for years--and it was filled with uh, I don't know, just a lot of different goodies that were kind of nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Uh so that was one thing I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And the other thing-- and we still have one of these, and it's in my son's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I just said to my son the other day, "Don't you ever lose this!" </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Uh, somewhere, after...[ don't know whether it was weeks or months, uh two things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">First of all--and I can't remember which happened first--but one day these two guys walked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It was sort of a mild <span class="DLF">hill</span> , the <span class="DLF">street</span> we were on; and these two guys came down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and each of them was holding one end of a bolt of grey blanket cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And it...[ mean, I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So I can tell you with with great accuracy that this is the...the worst quality fabric I have ever felt in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">IL..I don't think it had an 1ota of warmth in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But uh it was such a...I remember that nice feeling of these guys coming with this blanket cloth, and they just had like a knife or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And they just stood there and kind of, you know, pulled off...I don't know, maybe a <span class="DLF">yard</span> and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Uh, and everybody kind of got a square of this, and...and we got two squares. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Uh and that was, you know, that was like manna from <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Uh, and as I say, that grey blanket is in...in ... One of them got lost somewhere; but the other one is in my son's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Uh, and then I guess somewhere along those uh months, the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> right next door to where we were staying became free. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And I don't know why we had the good fortune, but the little <span class="NPIP">place</span> next door was a one...I think it was just a one story place, and it had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And there was a smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">inner room</span> , and then this larger <span class="INT_SPACE">outer room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And my brother and mother and I were given that little <span class="INT_SPACE">inner room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">outer room</span> was kind of divided in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And the back part of it was given to these two sisters who were married to two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And one of the brothers was named [Lutz (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I don't remember his last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And he was almost blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">He had very bad vision, and he spent a lot of his time cutting out those kind of leather belt loops that, you know, you hook one into the other and make belts. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I...1 remember we used to help him do that sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And he did that in the outer part of this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which was like his <span class="INT_SPACE">workspace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Uh, so those are, those are some of my... Oh, there was one other nice thing that I remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">There was a...a carpenter that we somehow got to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Uh, and I think he was kind of a very mellow-looking guy, with maybe reddish kind of hair and beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And you know, he seemed old to me then; but in retrospect he probably was thirty-five or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Uh but he made a wonderful little set of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toy furniture</span> for me out of wood, and then he...he glued little pieces of wallpaper on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , you know, to make it look as though they were upholstered. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And uh I certainly had those for years and years after that, and always treasured them greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Uh, so I guess those are uh... Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">One thing that I didn't mention, uh and this was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to try to get visas; and that must have been like late in August of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Uh, and I remember there was an air raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">My mother and my brother and I were in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">There was an air raid, and for some reason we didn't hear it and we didn't wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Somebody came and banged on our <span class="DLF">door</span> and woke us up, and we all rushed to this air raid [shelter] in the middle of this huge <span class="DLF">boulevard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And what I remember is that the smell of dog doo in that <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> was just overwhelming; and I remember that sort of scary feeling of being down there and the sirens and the commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And then...and then we were told to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span> , and that we would get visas in, you know, whatever it was--six weeks or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But then, of course, the war officially started. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The Germans came in, and uh...and...and we never got back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">But...but that I do remember--being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So then uh... Well, I remember a lot about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I mean, I remember doing design in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I guess that was one of my favorite subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was uh...1t was...1t was a very controlled kind of art class. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Design, it was...it was not the kind of thing that kids do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And you know, you colored in and out the little squares and things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Did you have any friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  You know, that's a very interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I don't remember having any friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I must have known some of the kids in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">My brother, I think, had a very nice sort of older boy, who was a pianist, who took him under his wing and I think did a lot for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But I don't remember...I don't remember any friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And I...I think 1t was a very lonesome time for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Uh, but I, you know, somehow I...I played, and I played with the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">doll furniture</span> ; and I uh...I think I spent a lot of time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I think my mother played with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I... do remember one thing, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I think this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Uh, and I think this has also stayed with me for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I remember my brother was playing with a group of kids his age, and they were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Maybe they were playing hide-and-seek, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I was trying to keep up with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And I fell, and I remember having these enormous scabs on...on both knees for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I...I...I know I've always had a fear of falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And when our kids were small, I...I ust found it intolerable to see them run. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And so I would always let my husband take care of that, you know; and I would sort of turn the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Because I didn't want to inhibit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But uh [...1 remember that day, I remember those bloody horrible knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And...and you know, and uh...but I don't remember having any little friends of my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  Why... When did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Uh, we had been in touch with my father's sister and her children, and they were trying very hard to get us visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And apparently we would get a visa; the visas, I guess, expired in fairly short periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And so we would... apparently, we would get a visa and there would be no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , or we couldn't get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And then there would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but no visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And...but apparently somehow things came together, and we left and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And again, I thought that was just for a couple of days; but my brother tells me we were there for several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Uh, and I don't remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But apparently my brother did a lot of uh leg work there, and it was a matter of just standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> after <span class="DLF">line</span> after <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And then, finally, everything worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">You know, we had to get an entry visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and an entry visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , and an exit visa for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ; and it had to be done in the right order, because, you know, one couldn't be had without the other one first. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And apparently there was an incredible amount of... of red tape and bureaucracy and <span class="DLF">waiting lines</span> , and there was no food; and it was just a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I don't remember any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The only thing I remember quite clearly is getting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> one night and going through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Now I don't remember... didn't remember, until my brother told me, that we stopped I guess twice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But I remember sitting in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which was...I mean, it was like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> during rush hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Uh, and I remember that it was like this sort of totally chaotic scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I mean, there were women in babushkas with big baskets; and I think there was one woman who had a chicken in her basket, you know, tied up with a scarf. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And uh this sort of pandemonium scene, and being on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And then I don't remember anything else until we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> going to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> Uh, but my brother uh has a lovely story about going through the uh border check, uh at the <span class="DLF">Portuguese border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And he said... you know, I mean, there was no food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It was a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was dirty and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And then everybody had to get off to go through customs; and my brother said, "When we got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , it was like a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">You could smell fresh rolls, and it was all clean." </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And uh so he...he just, you know... I mean, when he tells that, he just breaks out into this wonderful smile. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Uh, and I don't remember being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Apparently, we walked around there for two weeks, waiting for this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> --which was called the S.S. Exeter--to sail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Let's hold it there for a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  We skipped the St. Louis, huh? (</span><span class="sentence" id="478">Laughter)
QUESTION:  We'll change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">TAPE #2
QUESTION:  Let's pick up now. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">You are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and you have arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Uh, what happens when you get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Where did you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="483">What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  I don't remember anything until we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And then I only remember something which is not very pleasant; and that is, that I guess on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> uh there was, you know, suddenly food. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I mean, real meals, and...you know, and a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> which looked nice, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But all three of us were seasick, essentially, the whole way across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And so uh I don't think we were able to, after finally getting to some nice food, uh to really avail ourselves of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Uh, and I guess that's about all I remember about that trip, uh until we arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> And one of my earliest recollections, there was something that was very uh...1t caused a lot of apprehension in me; because uh I had never seen an oral thermometer, because in Europe we use these underarm, you know, mammoth-sized thermometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And these people, I think, in white uniforms came around; and I remember sitting in this big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , and somebody came around and stuck an oral thermometer in everybody's mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Uh, so I think I was apprehensive, not only because I was little and I...you know, this seemed like really weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Uh, but as an adult, as I look back, I have a feeling that I also was very aware that this was still another check point and that you could still be turned away. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I don't know whether somebody had told me that, you know, if you weren't healthy you couldn't come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I mean, maybe my mother had been talking about that or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But I remember that arrival time as being a time of...of apprehension. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And then I remember being picked up by the relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Uh, and what I...what I remember most dramatically... Well, first of all, there was this...I think 1t was a big fancy black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I mean, not fancy by American terms; but to a small kid who, you know, just had not seen anything like this for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Uh, and I was sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seat</span> with my mother and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And my mother was next to me, and she was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">window seat</span> ; and my aunt lived in uh...in the lower part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , which was not a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> --uh, <span class="DLF">Avenue D.</span> And uh as we drove into that neighborhood, my mother...I mean, I could hear her. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I could hear her very audibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">My mother whispered in German, under her breath, something like, "Have I suffered so long, and come all this way, for this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I think that that was...I mean, that struck me as being... I mean, in retrospect... As I think back on it, I don't know what I thought at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But in retrospect, 1t seems like such an ungrateful statement to make at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Because, you know, I mean, suddenly we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And uh...but I think she was so appalled. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I don't...you know, I'm not sure why she was so appalled, because it surely must have been better than, you know, what had been in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But uh...but anyway, that's ...I remember her saying that. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And uh so then uh we went and lived in my Aunt Lena, who was Lena Klinghoffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Uh she had what was really quite a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and she had five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they were grown; but three of them were still living in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Uh, and Leon and [Albe (ph)], the two boys, were living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and the youngest daughter, Dorothy. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Uh, and somehow she made the kids double up. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And...and so my brother and my mother and I got one tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and we actually lived there with her for about three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And uh I guess my mother went out apartment hunting and job hunting, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Uh, and I mean, I remember a lot of anecdotal things happened in my Aunt Lena's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Like uh uh...I mean, everybody sort of assumed that, because we had been starving for the last two years, that we would eat anything that was put in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Well, that was not true at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">My brother and I were the world's fussiest, pickiest eaters. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And you know, and this food that was put in front of us was...I mean, it was very alien kind of...of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Uh, and so we...we...and probably our stomachs were so shrunken anyway that we didn't need very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And so we...we were very...you know, we didn't eat a lot of things that were put in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I think my aunt thought that was very peculiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And uh uh...and then I...] remember, uh you know, my mother had always been very proud of the fact that she never learned to cook, and that she...you know, that other people had done things for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And uh, of course, she very quickly, when we got out <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , learned how to cook a certain number of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But uh she would always say, "I don't even know how to boil water." </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And then one time my Aunt Lena got sick, and the kids were out. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And...and I think my mother really...1 don't know, she was supposed to make some porridge or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And she really...she sort of couldn't do it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Hard to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And I don't know; I sometimes get the feeling that it was like almost, you know, could she really not do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I mean, how do you get to grow up and not know how to do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Or was it all a put-up job? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Well, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Uh, turned out that my mother was a very talented lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And uh...and uh very quickly learned how to do all the things that...that were needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And I think the really sad thing is that uh there was nobody around to really guide her about what she should do. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And you know, and...and my Aunt Lena was not a wealthy woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And uh so I think it was...1t was necessary to uh... to sort of quickly get something going. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And so my mother did uh the easiest thing, and the first thing that came her way. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And she spent the whole rest of her life working as a sewing machine operator in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Which was kind of very heavy work, uh but I think... And she's a very hard worker, but... And I think it was not so much the hard work that bothered her; but I think she was...she was very, very bothered by the kinds of people that she met in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and she felt totally alien from those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">You know, they uh... I mean, she was...she made acquaintances very easily, but she didn't make friends very easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Uh, and I think the people that she tended to make real friendships with, insofar as she did, were always, you know, other people her age from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that, who sort of...you know, where they could talk about what had been, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Uh, and she just found the conditions in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> appalling. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Uh, I mean she was so ...first of all, she was so European and so formal. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I mean, it...it drove her crazy that people called her by her first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I mean, nobody every would have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You know, she was "Frau Dr. Reif," and not, you know... And all of a sudden, she's "Klara." </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Uh, she would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and sometimes... I think one time she even cried, because she walked into an <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and some guy was sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> with his feet up; and he didn't take his feet off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> when she walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Well, you know, you didn't treat ladies that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And uh uh...and then, I mean, the whole new thing to her was the kind of language that people used in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I mean, she had never heard anything like this before. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And so she...you know, and...and gradually she learned to cope with it, and she kind of... You know, she would kid around with people at work; but I don't think she ever, you know, really felt happy in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And as I say, it wasn't just the hard work, but it was really more that she just felt this was not her milieu. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Uh so she was a very... mean, she was a very...basically a lonesome, unhappy woman in many ways in her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">But, on the other hand, on the surface she was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I mean, she...you know, she always kept herself busy and very involved in this and that and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And she learned English, I think, relatively quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Uh, and uh she...you know, kept herself active and always knew where all the free concerts and free plays were, and took advantage of all those cultural things, and ran around to the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And uh uh...and so she did all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I...actually, I should say that really was much later; because in the early days, life uh... in the early years, life was very very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So after three months, when we left my Aunt Lena's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , uh I think at her first job she was earning $15 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And I think the rent was $45 a month in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , or maybe $35 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So for...for a long time she hardly ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I mean, you know, all her money went to paying the rent and feeding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And uh...1 mean, she was the usual, you know, Jewish mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I mean, we came first always, everything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Uh, and she gradually...you know, she...I...she never... I mean, she would have been a fantastic bookkeeper, and she would have been so much happier, you know, if somebody had led her into that when she...once she mastered the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So she spent the rest of the time in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And uh she...uh she really...she did not... I don't know what to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I mean, for example, my brother and I never worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">You know, and in retrospect that's really weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Nobody ever asked us to contribute to the family income. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Uh, our job was to study; and everything, you know, kind of rotated around that. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Uh, so that...and in some sense, I mean, you could say that I was a spoiled brat once I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Because when I wanted to do my homework, I told my mother she couldn't wash the dishes until after I finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Because the noise of the water running bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So here's this lady who's been working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and then, you know, travelling and...and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I mean, I did help around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Uh, but I mean, she basically made dinner and she washed the dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I think I sometimes dried them. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And uh so she did all this work, and then she...she did this incredible bookkeeping thing every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">She would not go to sleep until the amount of money in her change purse matched with this little...she had a little book she carried with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And every...even if it was only two cents, it got written down; uh and it had to match to the penny. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And she would go over it, and over it and over it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">You know, "Where did I spend that extra ...?" </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Whatever, even if it was only three cents, until that matched everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And it got to be funny, because in...1in later years once I remember having a little argument with her about how much a certain dress that I had cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And she just went right back and pulled out her book. "</span><span class="sentence" id="592">No, that was...you know, it was $13.95!" (</span><span class="sentence" id="593">Laughter)
QUESTION:  What about uh you, during these years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Well, uh I think I was kind of a...1n some sense, a dual personality kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I mean, I was...I liked to play, and I was kind of, you know, fun-loving and...on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Uh, but there was this other side of me that was serious and thoughtful, and I guess introspective and a lot of other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And...and lonesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Uh, not the kind of lonesome that... I wrote a poem about this, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">More thinking about my mother; but not the kind of lonesome that goes away when other people are around, but just a kind of inherent feeling of...1 don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Uh, I mean, only now in recent years I very often think that the only way I can explain it is, you know, maybe it's what happens to a kid... I mean, what happens when a four year-old kid 1s told that she's never going to see her father again. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Especially, you know, having been told that...that he was incredibly affectionate to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I mean, what does that do? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">What does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basically...I...you know, I love to dance and I like to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And my brother and I love to tell jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Uh uh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of my brother, which is much more evident I think in him than in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But there's a very morbid part of me also. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I mean, it's a...I don't, you know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but 1t never goes away. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So uh...and then I think, I mean, my mother certainly tried very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But I think she did and said some things that were not really very good for kids growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She always told us that we were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I don't think that was very good for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Uh, we were supposed to be "aristocratic"--you know, in quotes. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I mean, that was a myth. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I don't...we were not aristocratic in Europe, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I mean, we were just reasonable, middle-classed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Uh, but uh so I always felt different. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I felt different, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I mean, you know, I come, here I am at age seven learning my third language, and sort of--if you consider the whole Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And I remember coming to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ; and you know, all the little girls and boys around me are, you know, obviously talking about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And I can't understand what they're saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Well, I learned English really fast, let me tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Uh, but I always felt different. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Well, you know, the more different you feel, somehow you stay different and you become different. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And uh uh...and to this day, I still...1 mean, no matter...1 mean, I always feel different. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And I think I never thought of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist that they interviewed in the [Boston] Globe; and he said, "I always felt a little different, and it always hurt a little." </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And when I read that, I thought, "That's...that's really...that describes me." </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Because I think subconsciously, somehow I've always wanted to belong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatever, you know, groups of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Not ever to belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things and I don't want to belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I don't uh...I don't like being associated with divisive things. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I mean, I have very mixed feelings about, you know, even about belonging to the...the quality of being Jewish, or whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Uh, because I think that's very divisive. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I mean, I...you know, all the divisive things that have happened in history have happened because people are...you know, belong to...to some of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So that's not the kind of belonging that I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But the...belonging to...to, for example, uh... Oh, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Within an academic environment, uh people who have similar interests or people who like to do some activity or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I always...I mean, I'm 55 years old but I still always feel that there 1s something different about me compared to all these other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And it always...in some strange way, there's a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Uh, and then, of course, when I was little, the difference became greatly exacerbated because there was such an an emphasis put on learning and studying and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And that was not the favorite activity of most of the other kids at <span class="DLF">1092 President Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And so the other kids would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and uh go out and, you know, play--this, that and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And I would very often...I mean, I did play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But I did a Hell of a lot of homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And in retrospect, I think I did a lot more homework than was ever assigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Uh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They were not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I, at some very early age, decided I was going to be a scientist and I was going to do this and that and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And uh I suppose part of that was enhanced, in that, you know, I mean my mother just kind of expected that we would do things and she knew that they were not going to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And uh...and I think she did not let that pass quietly by. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I played and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not allowed to do anything dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And that included uh... My mother used to have a fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I mean, in those days people thought that if you walked up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> --and we lived on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time I had to walk up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Uh, I was not allowed to uh ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , uh when the other kids were learning to ride <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> ; and I think...I think partly that was a financial matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">You know, I mean, it took a quarter an hour to rent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Uh, but I think mostly it was a safety matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But one of the things that happened very early on is that uh...I mean, I had this brother who was almost eight years older, who was a very...we were very close; and I had my mother, who was a very worrisome Jewish mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I think very early on, there were many times when my mother would say "Black," and my brother would say, "White." </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And at a very early age, I think I discerned that my brother's responses came from the head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And that, obviously, from the head was better. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to make a decision between the two opinions, I almost invariably did what my brother said. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Uh, and he was very protective of me; and we had a very sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But it was a very uh uh loving, and very uh you know sort of...we were always, you know, sort of kissing and that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And, by and large, people did not yell, and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , because I...he had his own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but I studied in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , uh he would be right there. "</span><span class="sentence" id="668">What are you saying to this child?" </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And uh I remember funny things, like uh if I had a cold uh my mother would say, "Well, maybe you should stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And my brother said, "You take two handkerchiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're using the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Well, I mean, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the two handkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess, I probably spent or tried to spend and probably did spend a certain amount of time with my brother's friends, who were much older than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I mean, they were adults and I was still a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I think they were trying to get rid of me a certain amount of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I mean, they did...my brother took me to my first <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And one of his friends took me to my first ballet, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Uh, and I remember once my mother getting involved, because my brother didn't want to take me someplace he was going with a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And my mother - I remember this 1s so ridiculous - my mother said, "You can't go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't." (</span><span class="sentence" id="679">Laughter) Uh, so it was not a typical childhood, in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">You seem to have pulled a lot of it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I think before we break, though, what I'd like to ask you... First of all, 1s there anything that you want to add that you haven't already covered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Well, uh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I think maybe I'd like to mention that I talk about this very easily now, but that all the times when my mother was still alive and that she wanted to talk about some of these things, I really didn't want to hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I didn't want to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Uh, first of all, because she would get very emotional, and I... And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate that. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my kids responding in the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I mean, that [they] don't really need this. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Uh, and so I really went through very many years, essentially, not thinking very much about this and making believe it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And when the other kids or other people would ask me, "Well, what effect do you think your background had on you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I would say, "Well, I was too young and I don't remember anything, and I don't think it had any effect on me." </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I think uh--and I've been trying to write about some of these issues--I think that there's a certain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and you're sort of building your life and it's very easy to sort of not look back and push everything aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think for other people also, somehow the back...background comes back to haunt you. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And it wasn't really until after our kids were born, and...and uh you know maybe when I was about 35, that I started noticing that I...that certain things I did were not really logically explainable by...by things that were happening then. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And that the only logical explanation of why I was doing certain things in that way, or doing them at all, had to do probably with some of the things that had happened very early in life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And you know, my father disappearing and uh...and things that happened tn... in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and uh...and in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> , and uh... and that whole business of sort always being on the run for those years, and being scared, and uh... And I think there is a lot of interesting material uh to explore there. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Uh, and uh...and to explore with other people who have had similar experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Uh, I think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, I mean, I would always like to have a controlled experiment, and of course there is no controlled experiment--but trying to pick apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Uh, and of course it's only conjectural, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but somehow trying to define for myself, you know, what things that have stayed with me are really due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And what things are just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents by and large are crazy anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And...and so you, your parents uh somehow inflict on you uh some of that craziness that they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Uh, and it's hard to tell, because of course I don't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And it's only in recent years, and actually since she's died, that I've really thought enough about this to to realize that, you know, she might have been and probably was a very sort of, you know, happy carefree person in many ways uh but I never knew her. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I mean, my mother wore black for years and years and years; and then she finally switched to navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And it was, you know, it was only very very late, when I was already essentially an adult that she would ever wear anything that was red, or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she kept up on [my] <span class="DLF">father's grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">She always you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Uh uh she she always uh...you know, I mean, she always I think in...1n many ways--in her thoughts, at least--she always lived in her past. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Not...not in her actions, but you know... "If I only had my sister to talk to," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And then one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh because I...1 do remember this and it was very dramatic was right after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">There was a blue letter that arrived from...I think it was from a cousin of my mother's who ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> --and I don't know if he's still alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had happened to many of our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And I mean, that, you know, I remember it as being horrendous; but now, when I think back, that must have been just such an incredible nightmare to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean, essentially everybody was killed, and...and some of them in rather grotesque ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Uh and [...1 guess I wish I could have been a little bit more understanding of me in relation to my background, and I think that would have lead to...to my having a better understanding and appreciation of my mother uh during those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got along very well uh until the other girls started dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And then she got... END OF TAPE ...like our live-in baby sitters. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And I had my very strong, very very democratic ideas about uh...you know, the way those people should be done, should be treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And I...and I think in some sense there was kind of...I guess, she verbalized it often. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">She felt that we treated our live-in baby sitters better than we treated her. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And that was probably true, because they didn't sort of interfere in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when she should have become a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I think...I mean, in retrospect now that was because she was very lonesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So there's a lot more, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it sometime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I hope you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Uh, thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Is there anything else you wanted to...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  As a postscript, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">We'll get to photos in a minute, but because you lived in the Klinghoffers...lived with the Klinghoffers for a while and there has been a great interest lately in Leon Klinghoffer, after the Achille Lauro incident, do you remember Leon? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Can you describe him as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  Uh, I remember...I remember all five children uh very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Uh, I guess I sort of uh really liked at first the youngest daughter best, because she was so pretty and dynamic and she dressed so nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I was a little girl, and uh...and I guess, I didn't take very much interest in the two boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I think partly because they were involved in, you know, they ran this <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> and they were busy; but I think also they seemed a little gruff to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Uh, the girls, all - actually it's funny - the girls were all very well-spoken even, though the boys come in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But the boys have much more of a vernacular New York way of speaking, and uh... But anyway, they...they were - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they were not so interesting to me when I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And I did occasionally go to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But the thing that I remember just incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere along the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this absolutely horrible teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I mean, it was a dollar an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And I don't know whether that was a lot in those days - I think it was not even a lot in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">But she was...she was not a very good teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Uh but anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And I only took lessons for maybe a year or something, but somehow in the course of that year--or maybe it was a little longer--there were two recitals where I played, you know, a diddley something-- "In My <span class="DLF">Country Garden</span> ," or something-- for you know thirty seconds. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">At one of these recitals uh... and you have to understand that in those days I could never have anything that any of the other kids had, and I rationalized it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I always said I didn't want any of the other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But uh at Easter time, you know, the other kids would get new suits, and I...I usually didn't, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Leon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet of pink peonies, you know; which are these really hugh full flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And I...I Just will never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I mean, that was...that made quite an impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And just a few months ago, I was thumbing through one of my mother's old photo albums and on one of the last pages this, there was this bunch of flower petals, and in one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> one of these flower petals - you know, they were all brown, there was still a little bit of pink and I suddenly realized that those were probably the left-over of the pink peonies uh so that was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Then I remember Leon Klinghoffer went into the army and I remember hearing that he uh I don't know whether - but anyway something happened and I guess he was in Europe and he became hard of hearing in one ear uh and then he came back and he met this very attractive doll-like woman who he married, Marilyn Klinghoffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Uh and I remember sort of thinking, because he was not really very attractive physically, and uh I think he already then maybe had a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me, and here, you know, he married this incredibly uh pretty uh woman uh and they went on to have kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And my mother kind of kept contact and went to the wedding and I don't remember where I was at the time, but I I didn't go and I didn't see Leon Klinghoffer for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I did occasionally, like in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> I needed something and I went to his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy it and uh but about what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a bar mitzvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worcester</span> and Leon came. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And by that time, he had already had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Uh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even then--he pulled me over. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And his speech was quite slurred, because of the stroke, at that time; and we just talked for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And he said, "You know, I want you to know that your mother was really a very good woman." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Uh, and I...[ remember being incredibly impressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And she was still so attractive-looking; and thinking, you know, "What a fantastic lady this is! </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I mean, she takes care of him, she works..." And you know, and she had told me all these stories about the some of the things she did for her kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I...I really felt this incredible feeling of respect for her; and I took her business card, because she was working I think for a <span class="BUILDING">publishing company</span> at the time, and I put it on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And I said, "You know, I really think I ought to get to know Marilyn better." </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But then, of course, you know, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I was in <span class="REGION">New England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And uh I guess I talked to her maybe once or twice more at another family function. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And then there was this morning in October of '85. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I was sitting at breakfast next to my husband, and he had the newspaper open. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I was reading something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And I, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And the thought went through my mind, "Gee, that lady looks just like Marilyn Klinghoffer." </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And just seconds later, my husband said, "Isn't your cousin's name Klinghoffer?" </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And I said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And he showed me this article uh about the highjacking of the Achille Lauro. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I...I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And I think it was either later that same day or the next morning, we turned on the television and he had been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I...I mean, I was just totally incredulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Uh, well, I think would have been incredulous if it had been anybody that I knew on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">But somehow for it to be this person who was part of the family, that helped get us over here; and it was now, you know, forty-five years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Uh, I mean, I...and you know, I kept...I kept thinking to myself, you know, "Statistically, what are the chances that these two events should be in the same person's life?" </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And I...1t was... Anyway, I went down to that funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And that whole family is very...they are very closed-mouthed about when things go wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I mean, in contrast to the people that I hang around with, who...who are very...you know, they sort of talk about this one's got this and this one just had an operation and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And so, when I was going down to the funeral, somebody--it was Dorothy, I think--said to me, "Well, you know, I think Marilyn's been ill." </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And because I have this morbid streak, I mean, immediately the worst thing crossed my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But I...you know, nobody had said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And so... But then after the funeral, everybody went to Marilyn's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; and she just looked like living <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And I, as I was leaving to go back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I...I kissed her good-bye. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I ...and I said, you know, "Well, maybe you'd like to come up and visit us, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And I'll see you again." </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And she sort of looked at me; and she said, you know, "OK, darling. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And uh...and I...[ thought, "Something is wrong with this woman." </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And a minute later, I said, you know, "Don't be silly!" </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I mean, you know, how would you look if you had just been through this whole thing, and...and your husband had been shot, and so on? </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And uh...and then nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And then I remember, in...I guess it was in December, we wake up to the news; and the minute the news went on, the first thing was that Marilyn Klinghoffer had died of cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And, you know, it was just...well, I...I1 never knew her that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I just...you know, I just felt very sad, because I somehow thought that I'd like to get to know her better and I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And all those other good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">But, so uh...that's the connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">DOCUMENTS & PHOTOGRAPHS (1) Uh this 1s my mother and my father and I think this was probably uh shortly after they had gotten either engaged or married, which I think must have been about 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">They got engaged in '25; so this is from that general period. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">My brother was born in '27. (</span><span class="sentence" id="807">2) This is a picture that was taken shortly after my father's death. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And uh uh that's me cheek-to- cheek with my mother, and uh that's my brother on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And uh I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Somehow, to me this picture says it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">It's just, I mean, all the faces look very grief- stricken. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And especially--I didn't mention this before, but--my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Who, of course, was much older; was uh...he, I guess he never got along very well with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But he really liked my father very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I think he was incredibly devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And I think during those times when my father was so uh depressed, I know he told me that that my mother just couldn't take it anymore and she would go off and do other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And he would stand in a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , just holding my father's hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And I think...I think he was just totally, you know, knocked for a loop that his favorite parent was taken away from him that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And I think it really shows in his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I think uh...I think you can see in my mother's face that she 1s just totally, you know, broken up; and...and I have a feeling that I probably didn't really understand too much about what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">But I think I must have reflected all the feelings that were happening around me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="822">3) Uh, this June there was a 50th reunion of the survivors of the St. Louis uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And uh one evening, there was a dinner and a lot of people brought various artifacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And this uh woman by the name of Mr.... Actually, a couple--the Irones (ph)--brought a photo album; and I was sort of thumbing through it, and I found these two photographs with me in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And this one not only had me--and here I am, right here--uh but this one also had a picture of my brother looking absolutely miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And my first thought was that he look miserable because he was forced to wear a double-breasted suit with short pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But uh I think he looked miserable because he just really knew what was going on; and I think he was very serious and unhappy on the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But I guess this was mostly a group of the children; uh and this is actually the woman with whom I roomed at the reunion, and who I had gone to visit about fifteen years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">She lives near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Uh, so that was a great find. (</span><span class="sentence" id="831">4) This is a photograph of one page of our passport, which we have in a very well-preserved condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">It's the usual passport, with the swastika on the cover and a big red J; and uh it has a lot of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">It tells that we left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburghafen</span> on May 13th, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And then it has a picture of my mother on one page, and our names with the uh the Jewish middle names--uh, Sarah for me--appended. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And on this page, it says in French: "Refugees of the S.S. St. Louis. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Reif, Chaje"--which is my mother's Jewish name--"et ses deux enfants, uh Friedrich et Liane"--"and her two children, Frederick and Liane." </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Uh, and of course there are many such passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">But for me, uh somehow especially because I didn't think about this for such a long time, every once in a while when this whole episode comes into my mind, I sort of think, you know, this...this can't possibly really have happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">This is some movie I saw, or some dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And then I go and fish out the passport, and convince myself that it really was real.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Liane, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Conclusion of Interview. </span>
