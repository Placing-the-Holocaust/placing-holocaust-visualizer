<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Did I go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I went to first the normal -- what they call it, the -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: <span class="BUILDING">Elementary school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  -- <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We were only boys, which was the norm over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We were approximately 45 young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I stayed there for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if you don't want to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you don't have to, but you have to go eight years for <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My father and mother thought I should get a better education, so at the fifth grade, which would be here, I started my first year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65"><span class="BUILDING">High school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So when I graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and I must say I was the only Jewish boy in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> because the other ones were all taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> before because of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I lived on the other side of the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Not only that, I might as well get this straight, there's no sense lying about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My mother was a converted Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My father went into the war in 1914, '14 to '18, World War I. He has a business already. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And my mother was his top sales girl and they also fell in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">When he was in the service, she went to the rabbi- and I have the papers <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- and took Hebrew lessons and converted Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now, this I mention because it -- later on, 1t comes out that that gave my father and mother a tremendous plus because she was in Hitler's sight an Aryan no matter what the religion was. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Just like the opposite <span class="NPIP">side</span> , if you were Jewish and converted to Christianity and Hitler came, you were a Jew no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So that's where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> happened to be the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that Chancellor Kohl went to, who was the Reich's chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">My claim to fame. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we were 50 boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I was the only Jewish boy in the whole <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  So did you have non-Jewish friends in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">As a matter of fact, if you want to know the truth, in my class we had about 10 or 11 -- I'm not sure anymore, I think it was 10 -- 10 fellows who were like the gang. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">When I say gang, it's not like a gang here. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We did all kinds of stupid things like, you know, if it was a real hot day and we wanted to get the afternoon off, we put a fire underneath the baskets in the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Was made out of metal, you know, so they said, "Get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , alright." </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I was never called upon to be anything different but a student and a buddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">In my class of 50 students, I had no enemy but one, if you want to call itan enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">There was one fellow in the class, I remember blond hair and glasses, he looked like a real future priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I mean, you know, that holiness about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And ever so often, he would say, "I hate you, Eric, I hate you." </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I says, "Why do you hate me?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="93">Because you killed my Jesus." </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I said, "Hans, I didn't kill your Jesus. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That happened thousands of years ago." "</span><span class="sentence" id="96">Your people killed my Jesus and you're a Jew, so you killed my Jesus." </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Naturally, this is all in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You want to hear it in German? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">No. [</span><span class="sentence" id="100">Laughter]
ANSWER:  And I finally got sick and tired of him and I said, "Look, Hans." </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I said, "You want to make a fight out of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I'll fight you." </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I'm a little guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I was only about four -- four -- 5'2". </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I grew up a little more later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he says, "No, I don't want to fight you, but you killed my Jesus.” </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It came to a point where I asked my Hebrew schoolteacher, who also was the cantor of our organi- -- of our <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , "What am I going to do with this kid?" </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He says, "Well, just tell him Jesus Christ was a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I was floored. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> since I was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I says, "Are you sure?" </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He says, "Absolutely." </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So the next time I was told, Eric, I hate you because you killed my Jesus, I says, "Do you hate all the Jews?" </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He says, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I said, "Then you must hate Jesus Christ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="118">What are you saying?" </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I says, "Jesus Christ was a Jew." "</span><span class="sentence" id="120">You're out of your mind.</span><span class="sentence" id="121">"I says, "Go and ask your father, your priest or anybody you want." </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That was the last time I heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">This was just a little episode that I like to tell because it was, to me, very satisfying to find out that Jesus Christ was a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  I graduated there in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Hitler came into power in '33. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And my other friends -- I had a lot of Jewish friends from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We used to go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And then in the afternoon, the children would come and we have like a children's service which I used to lead quite often.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Yes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="141">Laughter]
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And used to put blocks of ice underneath into, and that kept it cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But I don't- it had -- I don't know anybody else that had the combination of these two different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Our -- what shall I say, when -- when you -- when you dry the dishes, your hand - hand things, blue was for milchig and red was for fleishig. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So, I mean, we kept all this, but we were not orthodox.</span></p>
