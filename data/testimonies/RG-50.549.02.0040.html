<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  I cannot say that -- how it would be without her, because I’ve always known one life, and that was with my grandmother, and in a big family with -- with four cousin, which was more like brothers and sisters, and I had a very wonderful childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , three <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> high. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My grandfather, he had passed away at that time, but he had- had had a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span> , our neighbor town, and my grandmother was reasonable well off, and we had a wonderful life, and with much love. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Of course that was -- might be a little bit more old fashioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There were some thing which I saw later on, that our maids could do, that we were not allowed to do, but really we don’t miss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We had a very nice, very beautiful childhood together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What were some of the things that you weren’t allowed to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">How was your grandmother old fashioned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Five o’clock, was five o’clock, and when she had said something, she was a female dictator, so she was ra-rather strict, but I-I don’t remember any time she hit any of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It wasn’t necessary, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">A blink with eyes, a finger lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  [inaudible]
ANSWER:  That’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So -- But w-we were not a-afraid of something, no, no, no, no, but that was the way -- that was the rule of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they -- the rules we had might be -- was a little different from -- from others. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There was also a generation, and different from the way our maids were brought up and the way we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Well, your sister was there, so your grandmother was bringing up six children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So she -- Tell me a little bit more about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">What was she like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  She was a very heartful lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">She did new -- what she could do for helping people. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But still she had -- she was Swedish, so there a difference between Swedish and Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The Swedes are lay -- almost stiff, and -- in their way of life, and she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , very youn -- young and married my grandfather and they made together this wonderful <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and -- and she has always been in a commanding position, and she was that to her last day. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So -- But our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was full of love and we had all the things we wanted to have to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We had the big <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snagerstein</span> , that 1s three miles south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We had -- From our <span class="DLF">windows</span> we could see over the sounds of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We -- Every summer, we -- we wot out swimming and sailing. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> very near to us, so we had it, really, a wonderful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So -- A-And she was, of course, the manager of all the things, who make it possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  You said that she was -- that she gave things, that she reached out to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Can -- Can you talk a little bit about that, what you remember of her as you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  No, really, I dow -- just know that people came and -- and what -- what they got, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But I know during the war, she was very helpful in many ways to people who had no clothes, because she gave, of course, what we ha-have left over -- be -- so, she -- she was very h-heartly in -- in her way of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But the small details is difficult to remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  What do you recall about religion, growing up, or faith? </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , or were there any habits or rituals at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  My <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a typical Danish four wheel Christian life. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">You know, you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> when you on f-four wheels, for baptism, for wedding, confirmation, funeral and Christmas eve. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We were not -- Of course, we believed, but we were not church-goer, not church-goer. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We -- No, I -- I really think that the only religious influence in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was that grandma, every morning, 8:30, listened to the radio from the dume in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , there was every day, a -- a 10 minute sermon. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that -- that was -- But, we were not church-goer. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">First of all, there was quite a long distance to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And, by the way, my grandmother was not very fond of the minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He was from what we -- I would call a very Orthodox, and very narrow minded part of the <span class="BUILDING">Danish church</span> , called Internal Mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That, you know, everything was prohibited, but you were allowed to put cream and shoke in the coffee, but not ter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Not to stir it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Thas -- Hey wa -- Tha -- That’s the right, that’s right, that -- that part of -- of course it not -- not true with the coffee, but in that way, that everything was s-sinful. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that was too Orthodox for my grandma. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And th-the sermons from the radio, that was something else, that was a more Reformed, and open form of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But, of course, the religions, the bages should be the same, bus all the outfits, which make the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  What -- You’ve talked a little bit about the love in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and the -- the s -- the structure, the discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">What else do you remember about values your grandmother taught you, or perhaps a sort of a philosophy, as you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  There was no [indecipherable] kind of -- I really think that she thought that if we did what she did, it was okay [indecipherable] example. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I -- I just think that’s -- that was her idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She was not a -- a big thinker. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We had too much to do, but she was a good pe -- a good -- a good woman, and we loved her, and so I have had a childhood which was quite out of this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When I hear about what’s going on [indecipherable] well, that’s a -- I enjoy to think back a-at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  What did your grandmother do all day? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">You said there was some financial resources, was she working at all, fro -- a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  I understand you are a young American. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">If you have tol -- as-asked this to -- to a Danish girl in that age, “I have six children, I have a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you say wh -- ask what I do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I really think that -- We had, of course -- There was an aunt living with us, a- and she was so wonderful, and wa -- that was my grandfather’s sister, never married, and was -- was the lady who took care of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And then we h -- always had a girl, a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But those ga -- a -- a big <span class="DLF">garden</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That was the only thing I hated, it was to pick up the leaves from the -- the -- the leaves of roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">That was a big, and a boring job. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But there was a big <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and my -- my grandmother was very interested in -- in <span class="DLF">gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So, she got plenty to do, plenty to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  I want to talk a little bit about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I mean, did -- did you ever hear politics discussed at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">What -- What were y -- her ideals, or perhaps even yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">At this point, you’re 13 -14 - 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">How were you getting some of your political ideas? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">A- A-And it doesn’t have to be specifically with a specific party, but just ideas about how things should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  You see that, in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , we ha -- for all the years when I was young, mixed government between the social democrats and a radical party. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And, you must recall that, in the 30’s, after the Black Wednesday in ’29, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had had very -- indeed, very bad economical conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">A big part of our -- our export was agriculture, and the first -- everybody stopped in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , was our biggest <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , that was agriculture products. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So there was a really big unemployment in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in the beginning of the 30’s, and there was, even then, not any tension t -- revolution or to Communism, all this, because there was a social welfare in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">A social welfare, which was backed up even by the more conservative parties, so there was uni -- unity about -- to give the people who was not so good off as we, a helping hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And after ’36, it turns a little bit, and in °38, just before the war, we had a reasonable good situation, and of course the social democrat got the credit for that, and that is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And, at the same time, a certain Mr. Hitler, made his number in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We thought that Hitler was a clown. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We und-underestimated that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">His screaming, his completely directed reviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He -- When we saw him in the picture -- the pictures of him, when we -- when we heard him in -- in the radio, on -- on film, or this newsreels, it was -- w-we couldn’t understa -- we really thought the man must be crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And that gave <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> an injection against narcissism, because that was also completely foolish for us to believe that anybody are supermen. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I never forget, we as Danes, was so -- the best of all the Aryans, with our blue eyes, our blonde hair, and -- and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And we couldn’t u-understand anything out of -- and therefore, in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , there was a feeling of certainness, that that guy could never be a threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">That was °36 - °37. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There was a -- that w -- I say, here was not something I knew that time, because as 10 years old, you are not that interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But, the [indecipherable] was that when he had passed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> over <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Rhine</span> , and taking over the old German socketbeat without, and he was shooting at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Maybe the whole world could have -- be something else today, this day in April, in ’99, where we talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">If somebody had shot at the German army crossing the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> over <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> in 1936, maybe millions of people had been alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I don’t know, but I say it because that gis -- my impression what’s right or wrong in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Do you remember when you first began to form your own idea about Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Do you remember listening to the radio, perhaps with your grandmother, or aunt, or perhaps other people, neighbors, or --
ANSWER:  I can say the day exactly, the ninth of April, 1940, I woke up and -- because there was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We had -- To see an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> in that -- the -- in those days, that was something special, but here was lots of them, coming up from south, over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Sund</span> , and they were -- the destination were <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , because that was the day Hitler occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then they came back and they -- then went over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , and we have heard about the bombardment of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wachau</span> , in the year before, when the start of the war started, and afterwards, we got the -- the message that Hitler has threatened to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> if we did not -- gave up and sign the treaty that let -- he should take over the power and -- and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And we had that time, 13,000 soldier, that was all, and somebody was killed at the -- at the <span class="DLF">border</span> between Ge-Germany and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">That day I got my impression what -- a man who have made a non-aggressive treaty with us, and broke it, that man was no good, and he was certainly not a clown, but he was a threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And from the -- that day, I -- I despised the man, and the regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But I think that goes for many, many, many. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was 13 years, that ni-ninth of April, and it was strange because I had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , that was a dri -- a drive of about an hour or so, and non -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I’ve heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We have to -- seen the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and all this, but when we came to the -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , we had to stop one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> before Norbel, and w-w-w -- had to go out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and up in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , we heard the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And that was a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I was really in shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And -- But we could do nothing.

Before we move on too much into the post war era, I wanted to ask this question, and you’ve certainly touched on it many times, but why do you think the rescue of Jews, fellow citizens, but they were Jews, was so successful in -- in your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Why do you think that was so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  It was obviously the only way we can do it, the only way we could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">That’s, as I said before, 20,000 refugees, Danish refugees was in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , one-third was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Whether you’re -- Whether Dane, Jewish or non-Jewish, thas would be the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We had to do everything we could to save Danes from the fate, to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in 1943, not the -- the whole truth, but we knew that these people will live in agony, I -- we nee -- they had to live in humiliation, they were starve -- you couldn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And especially not the Jews, because they were absolutely innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">There was very few Jews in the Danish resistant movement, because that was an agreement, that we wouldn’t have -- we wouldn’t know, the people who decide that -- that because of a Jew was caught, we should see a Crystal night in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">We couldn’t have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">One of my good friends, [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now, he was one of the guys who took -- broke in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and took all the silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The Torah scrolls, they were all hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">Danish church</span> , remember that, all hidden there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">But -- There was quite a lot, and they were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And he was one of the few members of the -- the resistant movement, and together with other Danes, he took the silver, send it to the commanding chief of the German troops in -- up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Narveek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It came, because then would it go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span> , it was taken by the resistant movement, and -- and -- and -- and hidden ti -- until the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was not touch by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">This -- The Jewish prisoners interationta was not sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Why”? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Because SS, Gestapo, the Germans, have seen how we reacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And we were -- <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> were rather important as distributor of food to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And it mean, if they did something, it will be closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">The Danish railway sabotage was qua -- rather good. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">At the same time, they were building up the west la -- la -- the <span class="DLF">lansing line</span> , or what, <span class="DLF">west wall</span> what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And it was so much sabotaged in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , by putting sugar in the concrete, and it wouldn’t harden. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">You know that? </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And they have seen -- they have seen the result that -- but they never would have believed, helps the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They must have been completely out of their mind.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  First of all, that was -- that is not right, with organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">The success was because it was not organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">It was private -- I mean, here and there, but of course, later, and during the time, it was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">What I really mean 1s that if the Pope had done something in the 30’s, maybe the situa-situation have been different. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">To me, a situation -- I -- | am proud that the only <span class="BUILDING">church</span> who really condemned, was the <span class="BUILDING">Danish church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">That - And it was not just words, because many refugee found a shelter in the <span class="BUILDING">vicary</span> , and many Danish priests were in connection with the resistant movement, and that way, were helping the refugees to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , send them ta -- send them to -- to other people who was - but naturally, if there have been con -- people have condemned this, but who want to help a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  You’ve talked a lot in this interview, mentioned that -- the feeling of shame, of not doing enough, and then a -- and then how that -- that feeling shifted, when people -- Danish people began to do so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">In the -- In the era after the war, I -- I wonder if you could talk about that, the Danish people came out of the war feeling that really, you had behaved, you had done the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Many people have come out of the war feeling maybe that they didn’t make good choices, and as -- I -- I read a quote that the Danes did not lose their souls during the time of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And I just wonder if you have any thoughts on that, I mean, whether -- whether you disagree with it, or -- or if it sparks any other thoughts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  I never gave it a -- a thought, because we come -- we came back and we have been involved all the time, and I know that it was, as I said, with my grandmother’s blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I think the main thought in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , oh, God be praised. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We had a very cheap travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And- But we learned from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> went into NATO. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Today we are in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">We -- I learned -- to me for -- for instance, that the eur -- eur -- European union is very important, I z -- have worked for -- and the European movement for 35 years or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">That was -- NATO and that European movement was in order to avoid war. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We have seen the war, and in the -- the years after the war, we saw the casualties, we saw the million, we saw the result, we saw the con -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and -- and if continued in -- in the Soviet Union, where a <span class="BUILDING">gulag</span> -- where Stalin killed even more people than Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But, I thought, naive as I was, that unity in Europe could make us a better continent. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And I really think we have achieved quite a lot in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I really think that for the first time in history, there’s not being a war in 50 years between <span class="REGION">central European states</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We have, of course, now down at the Balkan, but we have not have this war between <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> an-and -- and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to be the master of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">We have had this union which -- and my idea of a -- a union 1s what Charles DeGaulle said, a Europe of the Fatherlands. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We are Danes, we are French, but we are Europeans, but we are not going to be directed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">We have our own parliament, but we have so many common interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We have the now -- which <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , not are in yet, the eril -- the economy, but we will have it [indecipherable] in some years, we will also be member of the European -- have the Euro as our currency. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I really look forward to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">But the question that we should have been proud of ourself now, I really think there was, in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , very much self criticism of the way we behaved, the government, the -- the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They worked too much together with the -- with the German authorities, but on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , we did not lose ourself, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">The -- I was not less Danes when I returned than before, I really think that. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">W-We had a much easier time during the war than most part. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Only <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> had it better. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Yeah, they -- that -- so -- and after the war, I really think that we have made very, very big progresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We -- And the situation between the nations in Europe is much better than it was before, and so we have learned by the war, f-for <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to go into NATO, that’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That’s just like to make a <span class="DLF">garden</span> on the inlands eyes of -- yes, because we -- It’s so long time we were a wild Viking nation, we still remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  You’ve mentioned <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> once or twice, and I just ge -- like to get you to sort of elaborate a little bit on that, and I must remind people listening to this, that it’s April 16", 1999. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It’s about two weeks into a very -- a very fierce bombing of <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> and of -- of Serb -- Serbian forces, by NATO. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So, I would just like you to tell us a little bit more about what you think about the decision to do that, and -- and why y-you think it’s important or not important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  I said before what would happen if, in 1936, we had seen the French attack the German -- the Nazi German troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Maybe million of people’s life have been spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Every time we stand against a dictator, you will see that he do whatever he want, and blame always his enemy for what is done. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Now, that was the only way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We had, in order to still live up to what we are taught, that we are our brother’s keeper, we must attack people who deny other peoples their freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I can’t see it co-could have been done another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Maybe I -- I -- I will not talk about sending in today, ground troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">What happened today is that a fanatic man dec-decide hundred of thousand people’s fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It’s -- It -- He is really a dictator, he’s really danger -- dangerous against the -- the world society, and to me it’s quite clear when you see the only people who support him, is the former -- people from the former Soviet Union, and <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , and both of these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> have severe problems when it comes to human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And human rights is one of the thing we mut -- we cannot adjust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We cannot say that human rights is for Christian, not for Muslims. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So I really think that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Go without saying, we have to fight against what I call the evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">QUESTION:  The what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  The evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  I’m going to sort of go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I wonder if you can tell us anything you remember right after the war, about trials of collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I know that there were some 1-1n -- 1n your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  Well, I was against these trials, because the collaborators who was taken, was a small fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And because of the -- the punishment they got, the lowest punishment for four years, all the small, easy cases, they got four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But, when the big cases, where the real criminals came up, oh well, then the softhearted Dane has said, that was too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">The people who got the four years, they served their time. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">The others, they got maybe two years, three years, and nothing hap -- and we had, of course, the severe examples, the killers, the informers, and -- and some of them were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They deserved that, but the whole s-system of laws we had, first of all, it was against Danish morality to have a law which punished things what has happened already. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">You cannot have a law going backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">QUESTION:  They had to enact new legislature for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] I-l-l-legislation, but th-their excuse was that the Council of Freedom, in ’43, had said, if that and that are done, it’s an offense, and it will be punished after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But, it was not a government, it was -- that had no power but okay, the main ideas in- in the law was exactly what the Council of Freedom has said, but the Council of Freedom had not included this small, unimportant guys, they would have the criminals, they would have really crimi -- the people who broke our law, who was traitors, but that was a small, completely inno -- not innocent, but ignorant people who was punished out, and that was -- and then, if you were lucky and first were taken prisoner three years after the war, and have done serious crimes, we would not have the death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Children, be at five, six, seven years, and well, that was wrong done. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">The idea was right, of course you sc -- you have to be punished for thing you do, but it was done in the wrong way. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">They hit the wrong people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  What -- What about in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span> , what happened to the -- there weren’t as many, but what happened to the handful of collaborators there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  Oh, they were arrested, but wha -- I must say, I’m ashamed of one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Quite a lot of the girls who dating German soldiers, ti -- they were captured and they cut all then painted swastika on the ma -- I -- I was very upset when I saw that, and that -- that was, to me that’s -- that’s a shame on -- on the people who did it, I-- was very brave to cut -- take the hair off a girl, that’s -- no, but it normally was people who never had done a single thing during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  The people who were -- who were looking for revenge, had ne -- I’m not sure what you said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  I said that the pe -- the people who -- who did that, never did a single thing until the war, they were -- they just find out how -- that was funny, that was -- okay, that was people of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I’m very much ashamed of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But it happened in all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> all over <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> that wrong people was taken prisoner, and wrong thing was done to -- to -- to women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  So what do you think was going on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Wh-Why did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  Because of the ligisation. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">First of all, because the Council of Freedom wanted to avoid the Night of the Long Knife, as we had in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , where --
QUESTION:  The night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  Of the long knives. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Where, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , for instance, where many was killed when the liberation came. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Also private problems was taken [indecipherable], then telling this is because of -- of the war, he is killed or she is killed, he had done so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">That was -- Therefore, the Council of Freedom wanted to have law, so the people who did something wrong, should be punished, but not private, this would be by the official authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And we did that -- we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The only thing was when the judges of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and that went the wrong way for quite a lot of -- of -- of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">S -- I don’t like what they did, I think that was completely wrong, they -- but punishment, not that way, not that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">That is the- the jury of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , we -- we can’t have that, not in a society wh-wh-who wants to have law and order.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  First of all, si -- I must say that what I’m speaking of, is why Holocaust failed in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">We are try to give the historical perspective, to give all the good thing which happen, with -- with the dates, the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It was in ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">With the help from the German, with the -- the position in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> that everybody would help a Jew, that it was not something uniqued. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I want to give that forward, and then, the question 1s, of course, how did you do it, and all this and -- and I try to te -- also, in humor that there’s been very funny times. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">For instance, some of the -- the refugees, they had to stay, because they couldn’t move the pe -- move the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And then a nurse asked the -- the -- the doctor, ““What disease shall we write on the chart here?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="923">Oh, call it German measles.” </span><span class="sentence" id="924">You see, that’s -- that’s typical Danish, typical Danish, that 1f we can have a little bit of joke, a little bit fun, and also to take the -- the atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">These people lay in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , had maybe a depression, they were afraid and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And then, call it German measles. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">They-- It gives a better atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So -- And then they asked the story about the king and the -- the -- the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And then, the -- always says, why was they not arrested? </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Well, because, as I say, nobody of these guys, knew a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They had to ca -- th -- from the gossip papers and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And also try to tell that -- that w-we -- we had food enough in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , we -- it was not under same control and that it was not an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">It was many, many different people who tried to help and okay, there must have been a guardian angel in one way or another, whether you believe in angels or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, because I think this is in your first interview, and 1-1-it’s just in speaking to you again, you’re clearly asked over and over, why did you do this, why did the Danish people help the Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And you -- you, over and over, try to convey why you did it, but you’re also trying to convey a kind of disbelief, almost, that you get asked this all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Almost like a frustration, and --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  No, not -- But I thi -- But I think it’s very telling, ab -- it 1 -- it’s telling of who you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  Well, I really think that what we did was a matter of decency. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Could I have been able to look and see myself in the mirror if I had turned my back? </span><span class="sentence" id="940">It was in ’43, we knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , we knew that we had the possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We knew that these people were innocent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I think that’s -- that’s motivation, must be valued, also for the people who ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">It’s enough for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I don’t think we made something unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I will never be able to live a -- a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you’re a hero because you give a helping hand to a fellow citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Or unique be-because you act in a decent way. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You see, that’s -- that’s the whole thing that my belief -- that’s why I’m not for democrac -- lif -- I’m not for dictatorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I want to be democratic, but I cannot eat oysters and drink champagne if my next door neighbor starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I cannot enjoy my freedom when my next door neighbor, an -- because of nothing, because of innocent work, are punished, because he -- he is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">It shouldn’t be a crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And we -- And we cannot accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And therefore, I -- I really find that it was just a matter of decency. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And that is why we don’t talk about, that’s not issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">That my children, they would have hated me, if I had done nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  H-How do you make sense of the fact, though, that so many other people do? </span><span class="sentence" id="956">That they want to applaud you for what you do, that they do single you out, that they do talk about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I mean, how do you make sense of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  Pll have to answer with a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Once there was a man who came to me and said, “Why are you always so happy?” </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And [indecipherable] say, “Okay, in the morning, I s- stand up, go out, shave me, and see me in the -- in the mirror.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="961">I do the same,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And then I ask, “Yes, but you don’t see me in the mirror.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  Let me see, h-how did your initial interview with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> come about in 1989? </span><span class="sentence" id="964">D- Do you know who recommended, or did you offer to do an interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, I was asked to -- to do it, and because we have been on <span class="DLF">L Street</span> there, several times, and because I was involved in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And -- And maybe Leo Goldberger have said I should -- could give some -- some views on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And today, because I’m the only survivor of the -- of the rescuer, not only, but you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Almost only.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  Y-You come frequently, and you’ve participated in a celebration at as -- a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  They have a -- They call it a Garden of Righteous, and every year they honor a person who have helped the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And I was honored some years ago, and I can mention that Professor Kaska is one and Frau Welnber another, so I’m in a very wonderful company. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So -- But I find that a very beautiful day and we meet quite a lot of the good friends we have here in <span class="REGION">Washington area</span> , and we love to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And one thing more, it’s at the right time. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">You see, time means something. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">We come here and have spring two weeks before we have it in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and we long for spring, after gray, very dull winter, to land in the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> here, 20 degrees Celsius, go down and see green <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , lots of flowers blooming [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">That’s wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">QUESTION:  What do you think of the current -- the last few years there’s bis -- perhaps an intensified interest in -- in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">There have been documentaries, and of course, the movie “Schindler’s List,” which won many awards. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">A-A-Ha -- What do you think of all of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="982">D-Do you think there is a genuine interest, or is it perhaps maybe just a kind of a fad, or how do you make sense of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  It’s very difficult, because we have seen, after the war, many thing which goes near Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">We see it today in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , we saw it at <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> some years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We see it in <span class="COUNTRY">Sudan</span> , Muslims again Christian, we see that in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">We see that in the former Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I think that it’s also the interest in -- in avoiding -- avoiding a new Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Therefore, I -- when I participate, many times, it 1 -- a part of an Holocaust education, and I really think that the Holocaust education maybe can give us some answers how to avoid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">1 mean, education is one of the things, when you see round the world, people living next to each other in different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , they believe the other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> will do that and that and vice-a - versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And they fear it, they don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">The more we’re able to know about our neighbor countries -- <span class="REGION">neighbor countries</span> , it will help. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I don’t believe that we are able to make <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> love each other, but could we, through education, make them hate a little less, we would had achieved quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">But, I think it’s so important, with the Holocaust education, and a part of the Holocaust education is also “Schindler’s List.” </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Last year here, we watch a preview of a picture about the Danish rescue of the Jews, and it was not so special, truthful, but it was a good story, and -- but it gives the impression all the time, that we can do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Not to avoid it, but to dimin-diminish the results of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">We -- We must do something, we must learn people to do what we, as Christian or Jews, are taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">That we are our brothers and sisters keeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">If we live up to that, I really think that it will be a much easier way to live, and a more lucky world.</span></p>
